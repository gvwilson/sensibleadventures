*Shapers and Bots* is a role-playing game for children age 8 and older
inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
and every animal that ever walked upright and wore clothes
(including my daughter).
Each game has one or more **players** and one **Director**.
Each player takes on the role of one *character*,
while the Director plays all the other characters,
who are called **extras**.
The Director can be an adult,
but children age 10 and older can also be Directors.

## Background

Centuries ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals to create dozens of thinking species,
then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels:
half-human creatures with strange powers,
thinking machines that are now their own masters,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you play a young animal adventurer or a newly-awoken bot
in search of adventure.
You can be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and can travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds.

## Game Mechanics

Every character in *Shapers and Bots* is described by their **characteristics** and **abilities**.
Everything they might want to do,
like climb a wall,
has a **difficulty**.
Together,
these determine the odds of success.

Characteristics and abilities have **levels**,
each of which corresponds to a **bonus**.
Every task also has a level,
which corresponds to a **target**

| Level             | Bonus | Target |
| ----------------- | ----: | -----: |
| Very Low/Awful    | -3    |  3     |
| Low/Poor          | -1    |  5     |
| Average           |  0    |  7     |
| High/Good         | +2    |  9     |
| Very High/Great   | +4    | 11     |
| Awesome           | +6    | 13     |

Whenever a character tries to do something,
it falls into one of three categories.
If the character's level is higher than the task's
and the outcome isn't particularly important,
the character automatically succeeds.
For example,
if a wall has Low difficulty,
and the character has Average climbing ability,
the Director can rule that the character gets over the wall.
(This rule helps keep the game moving.)

If the character's level is equal to or lower than the task's,
the character rolls two dice and adds their bonus
(or subtracts it if the bonus is negative).
If the result is greater than the target for the task,
the character succeeds.
If the result is less,
they fail,
and if the result is exactly what's required,
they succeed but with some consequences.
This is called a **challenge roll**,
or just a **challenge** for short.

> **Example:**
> Alouard has a High climbing ability
> but is trying to get up a wall with Awesome difficulty.
> Her player rolls two dice and gets a total of 6 points.
> After adding 2 for her bonus, her score is 8,
> which is well short of the 13 needed to scale this wall.
>
> Later, Alouard tries a different Awesome wall.
> This time her player rolls 11 and adds her bonus to get exactly 13.
> Alouard has succeeded,
> but the Director rules that one of her boots fell off while she was climbing.
> The clatter it makes as it hits the floor attracts some unwanted attention...

The third situation is a **contest** in which one character is trying to out-do another.
In this case,
both players roll dice and add their bonuses,
and the higher score wins.
If there is a tie,
the Director rules on whether the contest continues or whether something unusual happened.

> **Example:**
> Rufus and Doofus are arm-wrestling.
> When their players both roll 9's,
> the Director decides that they are still locked in combat.
> They both re-roll and get 5's.
> This time, the Director rules that the table has broken under their weight
> and sent them both sprawling onto the floor of the bar.
> That's when Rufus notices the bomb ticking away underneath his seat.

### Fluke

If a character has no rating at all for a task,
they can still succeed by **fluke**.
The player rolls a single die:
if it is a 4, 5, or 6,
she gets one point and rolls again
until she misses a roll.
Her score is then the number of 4's, 5's, or 6's she rolled in a row.

> **Example:**
> Zitterbee had never even *seen* a crossbow before today,
> but as the deranged one-eyed crocodile pirate charges toward it,
> it picks the one that Rufus just dropped and fires it.
> The Director rules that hitting the crocodile is an Average task,
> so Zitterbee needs 7 points.
> Its player rolls a 5, another 5, a 6, a 4, a 6---and then a 3,
> ending its lucky streak.
> Zitterbee's shot misses.

## Characteristics

By default,
every character has an Average rating for these characteristics:

- **Size** (abbreviated SZ): how large the character is.
  A character may list **Height** and **Weight** separately
  if that's a better way to describe her:
  for example, an extremeley muscular monkey might have Low Size
  but Average Weight.

- **Fitness** (FI): how strong and coordinated she is.
  Characters with a high fitness are good athletes.

- **Dexterity** (DX): how good the character is with her hands.
  This determines how well she can pick locks,
  play musical instruments,
  or perform surgery.

- **Intellect** (IQ): how good she is at book learning and abstract reasoning.
  A character with a low Intellect is not necessarily stupid---she just isn't good at logic puzzles.

- **Sight**, **Hearing**, and **Smell**:
  These measure exactly what their names say.
  (Note that smell includes the sense of taste.)

If they're important to the plot,
extras may have two more characteristics:

- **Courage**: how brave the character is.

- **Honesty**: how likely the character is to tell the truth.

Player characters don't have scores for these
because being brave and telling the truth (or not) are part of the game.

## Species

Every living character belongs to a **species**.
They all stand upright, speak, and have hands,
but have fur (or feathers),
and their feet look like animals' feet.
Different species have different default characteristics:

| Species   | Size           | Fitness        | Dexterity      | Intellect      | Sight          | Hearing | Smell | Special      |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------- | ----- | ------------ |
| bear      | High           | High           | Low            |                | Low            |         | High  |              |
| bison     | High           |                | Very&nbsp;Low  |                | Low            |         |       | horns        |

| rhino     | High           |                | Very&nbsp;Low  |                | Low            |         | High  |              |

| turtle    | Low            | Low            | High           | High           | Very&nbsp;Low  |         |       |              |
| wolf      |                | High           |                |                |                | High    | High  | carnivore    |
| zebra     |                |                |                |                |                |         |       |              |

When a player creates a character,
she may raise one characteristic by one level,
or two characteristics by one level each if she also *lowers* one characteristic by one level.
She cannot raise one characteristic by two levels,
and cannot raise any characteristic above Very High.

> **Example:**
> Larrapin is a 15-year-old rabbit.
> Her player has raised her Intellect from Average to High.
>
> | Trait     | Rating   |
> | --------- | -------- |
> | Size      | Very Low |
> | Fitness   | Average  |
> | Dexterity | Average  |
> | Intellect | High     |
> | Sight     | Average  |
> | Hearing   | High     |
> | Smell     | High     |

> **Example:** Nang-ma is a turtle.
> His player has raised his Size and Fitness,
> but has lowered his sense of Smell in exchange.*
> 
> | Trait     | Rating   |
> | --------- | -------- |
> | Size      | Average  |
> | Fitness   | Average  |
> | Dexterity | High     |
> | Intellect | High     |
> | Sight     | Very Low |
> | Hearing   | Average  |
> | Smell     | Low      |

## Skills

Characters start with Novice/Very Low ratings for these core abilities:

- **Acting**: impersonating people, feigning illness, etc.
- **Charisma**: charming people (or intimidating them).
- **Crafts**: fixing clocks, knitting, and other handicrafts.
- **Detection**: noticing little details (which isn't the same as merely seeing them).
- **Fighting**: hand-to-hand combat.
- **Healing**: first aid and treating poisons and diseases.
- **Knowledge**: general background knowledge of a society or environment.
- **Stealth**: the fine art of not being noticed.
- **Survival**: making a fire, knowing what's good to eat, etc.


Every character has *skills* that she has improved through practice and training.
Some common skills are listed below
along with the characteristic they are based on.
If a character doesn't have any special training,
her ability in a skill is equal to their level in the characteristic it's based on.
If the base is "--" it means that characters don't have any ability at all by default
and have to rely on fluke rolls for success.

| Acrobatics (FI)         | Acting/Disguise (IQ)   | Animal Handling (IQ)    |
| Boating (--)            | Camouflage (--)        | Camping (FI)            |
| Climbing (FI)           | Craft ++ (--)          | Dancing (FI)            |
| Drawing (--)            | Driving (--)           | Escapology (--)         |
| Farming (--)            | Fighting (FI)          | Fine Art ++ (--)        |
| First Aid (--)          | Gambling (--)          | Hunting (FI)            |
| Hypnotism (--)          | Juggling (--)          | Lockpicking (--)        |
| Mechanics (DX)          | Medicine (--)          | Metalwork (--)          |
| Music (--)              | Navigation (--)        | Persuasion (IQ)         |
| Picking Pockets (--)    | Riding (FI)            | Robotics (--)           |
| Shooting (--)           | Singing (--)           | Skating (FI)            |
| Skiing (FI)             | Sneaking (FI)          | Stage Magic (DX)        |
| Swimming (--)           | Throwing (FI)          | Tracking (--)           |
| Trapping/Fishing (--)   | Tunnelling (--)        | Unarmed Combat (FI)     |
| Ventriloquism (--)      | Weapon ++ (FI)         |                         |

The skills marked with "++" are actually categories,
and specialties within each category must be mastered separately:

- **Craft**: sewing, woodwork, baking, etc.
- **Fine Art**: sculpture, painting, etc.
- **Weapon**: sword, spear, pistol, etc.

A character may also have knowledge of history, a language, mathematics, science,
or some other specialized field.
Her knowledge of any field is initially zero:
she can't even use fluke rolls to answer questions.

> The Director may allow players to choose skills for their characters
> that are not on this list.

When a player is creating a character,
she made improve the character's skills in one of the following ways:

- Raise 5 skills by 1 level each.
- Raise 3 skills by 1 level and 1 skill by 2 levels.
- Raise 2 skills by 2 levels each and 1 skill by 1 level.
- Raise 1 skill by 3 levels and 2 skills by 1 level each.

| Skill 1  | Skill 2  | Skill 3  | Skill 4  | Skill 5  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 level  | 1 level  | 1 level  | 1 level  | 1 level  |
| 2 levels | 1 level  | 1 level  | 1 level  |          |
| 2 levels | 2 levels | 1 level  |          |          |
| 3 levels | 1 level  | 1 level  |          |          |

When raising skills that depend on a characteristic,
start counting at Low,
i.e.,
giving a character an Average rating for Singing counts as raising it 2 levels, not 3.
If the skill doesn't depend on a characteristic,
start counting at Very Low.

*Example:
Larrapin grew up in the mountains.
Her player decides to raise her Skiing by 2 levels from Average to Very High,
her Climbing by 2 levels from Average to Very High,
and her First Aid to Low.
(Remember,
when a skill doesn't depend on a characteristic,
raising it from nothing to Low counts.)

## Shaping

A small number of animal characters have psychic powers
that let them control or *shape* the world with their mind.
Characters who can shape typically start with a rating of Very Low,
which slowly improves with practice and training.
The six most common kinds of shaping are:

-  **Earth**: dirt and stone. Very experienced earth shapers can also shape metal.

-  **Air**: wind and sound.

-  **Light**: create (silent) illusions and wrap themselves in shadows.

-  **Water**: in its liquid form. Very experienced shapers can also shape ice.
   Using water shaping to control a living creature is extremely difficult
   and also a very serious crime.

-  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.

-  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.
   (Nobody can stop or reverse time, or see the future.)

It is *extremely* rare for someone to be able to do more than one kind of shaping.

*Example:
Larrapin is an air shaper.
Before her grandfather passed away,
he taught her what little he knew,
so her score is now Low instead of Very Low.*

## Conflict

Sometimes adventurers have to fight their way out of trouble.
Other times,
they have to talk their way past a suspicious guard.
Situations like this are called *conflicts*,
and instead of beating a fixed difficulty,
the character has to get a higher score than her opponent.

*Example:
Larrapin doesn't have any particular training in hand-to-hand fighting,
so her rating is Average.
She has just been tackled by an angry monkey whose rating is High.
Larrapin rolls two dice and gets a 3 and a 5 for a score of 1.
The monkey is an Expert fighter,
soe she rolls 3 dice and gets 2, 6, and 6 for a score of 2.
Larrapin goes down!*

## Injury

Fill this in.

## Bots

The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning floors to mining the ocean floor.
Since they disappeared,
the bots have repaired themselves however they can to keep themselves going,
and made new bots whenever they can find the right parts.
The result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike.
One might have six short legs and a pair of mis-matched claws for arms,
while another might use two rotor fans to fly,
but have only a single slender manipulator to pick things up.

Bots have Size, Fitness, Dexterity, and Intellect scores just like animal characters.
Their Sight and Hearing scores are Average by default,
but only a few bots have any sense of Smell at all.
(Most regard smell as slightly icky,
and would prefer that living creatures didn't talk about it so much.)

> We are working on a point system to help players create bot characters
> that are neither too weak nor too powerful.
> Until it's ready,
> bot characters will almost always be created by the Director.

## Example Characters

### Madica

Madica is a teenage fox.
She has worked on her parents' fishing boat every day since she was a child,
so while she's small,
she's in good health.
She has a keen nose,
and is also very good with her hands:
she's had a lot of practice tying knots and mending nets,
and her mother has taught her how to sing.

| Trait     | Rating  | Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Size      | Low     | Boating      | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | Fishing      | Very High |
| Dexterity | High    | Swimming     | High      |
| Intellect | Average | Knots        | High      |
| Sight     | Average | Singing      | High      |
| Hearing   | Average | Quarterstaff | High      |
| Smell     | High    |              |           |

### Rhymes With Orange

Rhymes With Orange was built to clean windows on ultra-tall skyscrapers.
It has long spidery limbs with suction cups for climbing,
but a very small body.
It also has a 5-liter storage tank built into its back,
and has modified the water jets on its arms to squirt almost any kind of liquid.
Rhymes With Orange's battery was damaged years ago
in an accident that also robbed it of most of its memories.
It can only go 3-4 days without being recharged by another bot,
so it is constantly doing odd jobs in exchange for power
or gambling to try to win a recharge.
(It only cheats when it has to.)

| Trait     | Rating  | Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Height    | High    | Climbing     | Very High |
| Weight    | Low     | Acrobatics   | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | Gambling     | Very High |

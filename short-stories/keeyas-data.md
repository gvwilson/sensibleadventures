Once upon a time, a girl was born in Botswana.  Her mother looked at her and
said, "We will call her Keeya, because she is as beautiful as a garden flower."

Her father said, "That is a lovely name."  Then he frowned.  "But---is she
supposed to be so small?"

"Oh bosh, worrisome man," said the nurse, gently taking Keeya from her mother's
arms.  "She looks perfectly normal to me."  She laid the baby on a table and
measured her, then put her on a scale to weigh her, and then gave her back to
her mother to nurse.

As Keeya's parents smiled at her, the nurse went down the hall to her little
office and put an official government form in her typewriter.  "FEMALE", she
typed in one box.  "19 inches" she typed in another, and "6.5 ponds" in a third.
(It was late, and she was tired, so she did not notice her typing mistake.)  She
put the top copy of the form in her filing cabinet and the yellow copy in an
envelope on her desk.

The nurse slept in the hospital that night, just in case Keeya or her parents
needed her.  In the morning, she bicycled into town and put the envelope in the
mail.  The postmaster put it in a bag with some letters, a boxed-up radio that
was being sent off for repair, and some pictures from a wedding, and then put
the box on a truck for the capital, Gabarone.

By the time the truck reached the big post office in the capital, it was
carrying a hundred and one bags of mail. Tucked away inside them were envelopes
containing two dozen forms like the one about Keeya.  When the clerks in the
post office sorted the mail, they put all those envelopes in a bundle and marked
it "Ministry of Health".

The bundle arrived at the Ministry building the next day.  There, in Room 303, a
little old man wearing little old glasses hummed a little old tune to himself as
he copied the information from the forms into a spreadsheet on his computer.  He
was very proud of his spreadsheets.  There was one for each month, and each one
had columns full of babies' names and weights and birthdays and everything else
that the government wanted to know.  "Keeya Motsumi", he typed, and "F" (for
female).  He chuckled at "6.5 ponds", thinking how funny it would be if people
actually weighed babies in ponds.

So Keeya's birth became a line in a spreadsheet on a computer.  There it sat as
weeks and months went by, until finally it was December, and time for annual
reports.  The clerk opened his email and wrote a message to his superior:

```
Ma'am [he typed],

Please find attached the monthly statistics for this year.
Should you require anything further, I am at your service.

Sincerely,
The Clerk in Room 303
```

He attached the spreadsheets one by one, checked carefully to make sure they had
all been attached (because he had once forgotten February, and the other clerks
had never let him forget it), and then sent the message.

*Zing!* His computer turned his email into little jolts of electricity and sent
them down the wire that connected his computer to the ministry's network.
*Zing! Zing! Zing!* went the spreadsheets one by one.

*Splat!  Splat splat splat!* they went when they reached his superior's
computer, and *bing!* went a little bell to tell her she had mail.  "Ah, right
on time," she said.  She saved the spreadsheets on her desktop, then opened each
one and scrolled to the bottom.  "AVERAGE" she typed at the bottom of some
columns, and "COUNT" at the bottom of others.  The spreadsheet hmmed and hawed
for a thousandth of a second and calculated the average weight, the average
height, the number of girls and boys, and everything else she had asked for.
She copied those numbers into another spreadsheet and typed "PLOT".  A beautiful
little graph appeared showing how many babies had been big or little and tall or
short each month.  "We are doing well," she told herself, thinking about the
graphs from years gone by.  Smiling, she sent the graph to the minister, then
turned to other things.

Those spreadsheets sat on her computer for three long years, quiet and still
like seeds in the desert waiting for rain.  One night, disaster struck: three
very bad men broke into the ministry and stole everything they could carry,
including that computer.  The record of Keeya's birth might have been lost, but
luckily for our story, the young man who took care of the ministry's computers
knew how to do his job well.  Every month, he made a copy of everything on every
single computer and then sent that copy to a friend who worked in another
building on the other side of the city.  When he heard that there had been a
robbery, he called his friend and said, "Are the backups safe?"

"Very safe," his friend promised.  "But I think it will be a big job to sort
through them all."

It was.  It took weeks, and one box of backups was never found, but eventually
most people had their files back.  "Oh, that reminds me," the clerk's superior
said to herself as she checked everything on her new computer.  "Someone was
asking about this."  She wrote an email:

```
Dear professor [she typed],

Please find attached monthly birth statistics for the past five years.
I hope they will be useful for your research.

Warm regards,
The Person Who Manages Statistics in the Ministry of Health
```

Her computer didn't turn her message and the spreadsheets into little jolts of
electricity.  It turned them into little pulses of light. *Blip! Blip! Blip!*
they went through a cable that connected to another, larger cable that led to
a great big antenna.

*Scrunch! Scrunch!* The big antenna scrunched each message into a little bundle
of radio waves. *Fling!* It threw each message up into outer space.

*Whee!* The email and spreadsheets flew straight up. *Ka-boing!* They bounced
off a satellite twenty-three thousand miles high. *Whoooaaaa!* Down they came.

*Whump!* Another big antenna caught them, just like you would catch a rubber
ball. It unscrunched the message and the spreadsheets and sent them to the
professor.

"Excellent!" he said when he got them (because professors really do sometimes
say things like that).  He saved the spreadsheets in a folder and then ran a
little program he had written himself to get all the numbers from them and add
them to a database he was building.

That database was like a spreadsheet, only thousands of times bigger.  It didn't
look like rows and columns on his screen.  Instead, he and his students had
programs to ask the database questions like, "How many babies were born in Costa
Rica last year?" and, "How many of those weighed more than six kilograms?"
(which is very large for a baby).  What had been a few words typed on a form and
then a single row in a spreadsheet became one drop in a pond of data.

At first, only the professor and his students knew how to use that data.  As the
database grew, though, more people wanted to ask questions about what was in it.
Eventually, someone made a web site so that anyone in the world could ask the
database a question.

The years went by.  The nurse moved to another hospital.  The old clerk retired,
his superior moved to another ministry, and the three very bad men were finally
caught and sent to jail.  And then, one day, Keeya sat down at the computer in
the library at her high school and carefully typed in a link.  "Hm," she said,
looking at the page.  "Botswana... fourteen years ago... female..."  She pressed
the button and waited while her computer sent a message to another computer that
sent it to another until finally it reached the database halfway around the
world.  The database hummed for a thousandth of a second and sent back a reply.

"Ah ha!" Keeya said, and then, "Sorry!" as the librarian shushed her.  She
clicked the mouse to take a screenshot, then opened her email and typed a
message to her father, who had never stopped worrying:

```
Dear ntate [she typed],
   
You see?  I __was__ a normal size!

Love,
Keeya

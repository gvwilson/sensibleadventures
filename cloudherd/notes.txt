- Make the *tralpa* a minor magician so that people see what magic looks like
- He falls to his death
  - Foreshadowing that Thokmay is a prince - he falls into the pond trying to rescue the *tralpa* and Dorbu rescues him
- Fencing scene where Noxy is being shut out by Thokmay (who turns out to be charming)
- Noxy's father Sickly (Sickly Sweet) shows up
  - He's a feckless pack trader
  - Dinner scene that shows how decent Dorbu is by comparison
  - Noxy is conflicted and decides she hates the rebels after all (jealous of their popularity, left out by Rash and Sensy)
- That same night, far away: the *tralpa*'s satchel (spelled) washes down to the valley where it is found by royals and his letters read
  - Reader scans the letter: "We must tell the king right away"
- Royals marching up the valley with hawks as scouts
  - Why so many for a handful of rebels?

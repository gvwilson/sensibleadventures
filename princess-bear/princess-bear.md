## Prolog

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight thousand
gallops from bow to stern and six thousand from port to starboard.  Its single
continent is surrounded on all sides by an ocean whose outer shore rises up to
hold the world as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.*

*Chernese history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well.
Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a long war that scarred the moon,
turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass, and littered the land with strange
magic.  When the war was over the Pilots were gone, leaving humanity and the
Gifted to carry on as best they could.*

*Now look there, where the Brumoso Mountains tumble down toward the ocean and
ninety little kingdoms squabble endlessly with their neighbors.  A small herd of
panicked clouds is fleeing west over orchards and fields.  On the back of one of
those clouds is a young woman.  She had high hopes for the day, but now all she
wants to do is survive.*

## An Unexpected Meeting

The tornado roared, tearing at the trees beneath it like an angry child pulling
up handfuls of grass.  *Left! Left!* Noxy mind-shouted, squelching her own panic
so that the young cloud beneath her wouldn't sense it and panic in turn.

Cloak hesitated. *Left!* Noxy ordered as forcefully as she could.

As the cloud began to turn, Noxy heard a mighty *crack!* She hoped it was just
an apple tree being snapped in two---she had seen farmers' cottages nestled
among the orchards below before the tornado appeared.  She had seen people too,
pointing and waving at the clouds overhead and then running for cover when the
tornado attacked out of a clear blue sky.

Noxy wiped wind-blown grit from her eyes, but more immediately blew into her
face. She could barely see Rind and the others in front of her. *Faster!* she
urged.

Cloak struggled to obey.  They had been flying since before dawn, and she could
mind-hear him tiring.  *Please,* she mind-spoke.  *I know you can do it.*

Without warning a branch as thick as Noxy's leg tore through the cloud and
clubbed her shoulder. She was airborne for one sickening moment before falling
back onto Cloak.  She dug one hand into the cloud and held on as tightly as she
could.  *Down!  Down!  Down!* she mind-shouted, not realizing that she was
screaming the words as well.

The injured cloud plummeted toward the ground. Noxy glanced back, afraid the
tornado would follow, but it had stopped above a pile of wreckage that had been
a barn moments before to tear the boards apart and whirl them around. Noxy cried
out at the sight of people tumbling through the air, but it was just laundry on
a clothesline.

Cloak scraped his belly against the trees, then sagged to the ground with a
mind-spoken mewl of pain. Noxy slid down his side, gasping as she jostled her
bruised arm. The branch had torn open the sleeve of her gray leather coat and
the heavy quilted shirt she wore underneath it, but had only scraped her
skin. Her knees went weak as she realized how close a call she'd had.

She and Cloak had come down on a narrow dirt track through a patch of forest
that lay between two apple orchards.  The summer-green branches of the oaks and
maples around them still shook in the wind, but she and Cloak were safe, at
least for now.  She took a shaky breath.  Rind and the other cloudherds would
have seen her land.  They would come and find her once the tornado was gone.
There was nothing she could do but wait while the tornado turned the farm into
kindling and then went in search of something new to destroy.

Hooves drummed on the road behind her. Half a dozen soldiers in yellow jackets
galloped toward her on stocky ponies. She struggled to her feet with a grimace.

The lead rider reined in a few paces away. "Are you all right?" he asked,
raising the black-and-yellow battle mask that covered his face.

"We're fine," Noxy said, cradling her bruised arm. "Did you see the others?"

"They went along by west," the soldier said, pointing.  "Looks like they all got
by clear."

A second rider shouldered his horse past the first.  "Noxy?" he asked
incredulously, his voice breaking. "Is that you?"

Noxy stared at the newcomer.  How did he know her name?

The second rider raised his battle mask to reveal a young man with four parallel
scars glistening slightly against the dark skin of his left cheek.  "Noxy---what
are you doing here?"

"Thokmay?"  Noxy stared at the prince of Gandan, cloud and arm both momentarily
forgotten.  She struggled to her feet.  "How---" Before she could finish her
sentence the world started to spin.  She sagged back against her cloud.

"Noxy!" The prince leaped down from his horse. He paid no attention to Cloak
edging away nervously as he helped her sit back down on the hard-packed dirt
track.

"I'm all right," Noxy protested, trying weakly to shake him off. "It's Cloak
that's been hurt." She tried to struggle back to her feet, but the prince put a
hand on her shoulder to stop her.

"Just sit a moment," he said firmly. "Jinpa!"

"*Sra*?" one of the soldiers answered.

"That farm we passed," the prince said, pointing back along the track. "See if
you can get help."

"Yes *sra*!"  The soldier snapped his horse's reins, only to pull up sharply
when Noxy said, "Wait!"

This time the prince didn't stop her from getting up. "The farm's gone," she
said. "The tornado tore it to pieces. I saw people running..."

The prince's jaw tightened. "Manpa!" he barked, his voice breaking again.
"You're with Jinpa. See if there are any survivors. Help them if you can. Double
time!" The two soldiers saluted and galloped away.

The prince looked back at Noxy. "Well," he said in a bemused voice.  "It's good
to see you, but what are you doing *here*?  It's a long way from Stale."

Noxy shrugged, then winced. This wasn't how she had imagined meeting the prince
again, not at all. "We were on our way to Chaghan.  Rind got a contract for some
rain there---she's the mayor now---and Apple Bridge was sort of on the way,
and..."  She shrugged again to hide her embarrassment.  She had wanted to
surprise him...

Before the prince could reply, one of soldiers called out, "*Sra*---above us!"
The other clouds had returned.

Rind brought her cloud down onto the road two dozen strides from Cloak and slid
off while her mount was still settling. Like Noxy, she wore her frizzy black
hair in long braids, but her leather coat was fringed with red and orange twists
of ribbon.  Her dark face was as narrow and as fierce as a mountain hawk's.

She strode over to Cloak without as much as glancing at Noxy, the prince, or the
soldiers and laid her hands on its flank.  "Sh, sh, sh," she said soothingly as
she closed her eyes to mind-speak with the injured cloud.

Thokmay caught Noxy's eye and raised his eyebrows.  Noxy shook her head
slightly---she still hadn't told anyone her secret.  The prince nodded almost
imperceptibly.

Rind gave Cloak one last reassuring pat.  "He could have been torn to shreds,"
she said flatly, rounding on Noxy. "And *you* could have been killed.  I'd never
have heard the end of *that*."

"Yes, *sra*," Noxy said, eyes downcast.

Rind glanced at Prince Thokmay and did a double take. "Oh hells," she said
blankly.  "What are you doing here?"

"That does seem to be the question of the day," the prince said mildly, his
voice cracking.  As Rind opened her mouth to reply, he continued, "We were on
our way to escort the new consul from Chaghan into Apple Bridge when we spotted
the tornado.  I expect he'll have gone on ahead---we should get moving too in
case the tornado comes back."

Rind's eyes narrowed. "Comes back?"  She hesitated before grudgingly adding,
"Your Highness."

The prince nodded. "It's not just some monster out of the Blight. It's been
hitting homes and farms for three weeks now, all people who've been helping us
track down contrabanders."

"You think someone summoned a tornado?" Rind said incredulously.

The prince shook his head. "No.  That tornado probably spent the last thousand
years in a bottle at the bottom of Fast Lake.  Some contrabander must have
dredged it up or found it floating in the river.  It's just our bad luck
that---"

"Your Highness!" The soldiers who had gone down the road had come trotting
back. Two frightened boys in hand-me-down clothes were sitting behind Jinpa,
while an old woman rode behind Manpa.

The two boys stared wide-eyed at the pair of grounded clouds while their
grandmother told her story.  The farm, it was her son-by-marriage's, she'd moved
in after the children were born, and they'd been out pruning, her daughter and
her husband that is, not the boys, and they'd seen some men in the forest with a
cart, and, well, everyone knew some people had a little business now and again
that other folk shouldn't pry into, but these weren't anyone her son-by-marriage
recognized, and they'd talked about it and decided they ought to tell someone,
and they needed some new clothes for the boys, they were growing so fast, so
they'd gone into town that morning, and then that thing came out of nowhere, and
the boys had been so brave, but what was she going to tell her daughter and her
son-by-marriage about the house?  The roof was gone, and the chicken coop, and
the whole *barn*, and---

"His Majesty will pay to have it all rebuilt," the prince told her soothingly.
"But right now, my men will see you safely into Apple Bridge. You can stay there
as long as you need to."

The old woman nodded, fighting tears.  The prince turned back to Rind. "You
would be welcome in Apple Bridge as well, of course."

"Out of the question," Rind said sharply. "We've already lost half a day, and if
the tornado comes back---"

"But Cloak is hurt," Noxy interrupted, "He'll never make it to Chaghan if he
doesn't get some time to heal."

"We don't *have* time," Rind snapped.  "We have a contract, and we're already
going to be late."

"Then I'll stay here with Cloak until he's better," Noxy declared.

"Out of the question," Rind repeated, crossing her arms. "I'm not leaving one of
my riders in the middle of nowhere."

"I'm old enough to take care of myself!" Noxy said indignantly.

"Just like you took care of Cloak?" Rind shot back.

The prince cleared his throat.  "I will take responsibility for her," he said.
"She can stay at the garrison house and her cloud can use the courtyard until
they're able to catch up with you."

Rind threw up her hands. "Like mother, like daughter.  Just promise me you won't
go looking for trouble."

"I never go *looking* for trouble," Noxy muttered, but Rind was already
scrambling back onto her cloud. A few moments later she was airborne, heading
west with the rest of the herd.

The prince's carefully polite expression turned wistful as he watched the clouds
fly away. "Can your cloud make it to Apple Bridge?" he asked Noxy.

She put her hand on Cloak's flank and mind-spoke with him before nodding.  "Yes,
if we go slowly. I've been pushing him pretty hard to keep up with the others,"
she added, feeling a sudden pang of guilt. "I think that's why we couldn't get
away from the tornado like they did."

The prince handed his horse's reins to Jinpa. "Put the lady and her young men on
Bucketbreath here," he ordered. "See them safely back to town, and tell the
staff that they're to be given rooms in the garrison guest house if they can't
find something more suitable.  I will take the cloud back with Noxious."

The soldier cleared his throat. "Um, *sra*, are you sure---"

"We'll all be safer if someone is in a position to spot the tornado returning,"
the prince said crisply.

"Yes *sra*," Jinpa replied doggedly, "But---well, Sergeant Gyalpa said to be
double sure you were back along the garrison in time for the dinner tonight.
With the new consul, *sra*.  What with protocol and all along by that."

The prince muttered something about protocol under his breath.  "The cloud won't
be any slower than horseback," he continued in a normal voice.  "And if I'm
late, I'll tell the good sergeant it was my fault."

"Yes *sra*," Jinpa said glumly.  He exchanged a look with Manpa that said it
wouldn't matter to the sergeant whose fault the prince said it was.

Prince Thokmay pointed at the two little boys.  "You two keep an eye out as
well," he said sternly. "If you see any sign of trouble, you tell these men
right away, all right?"

"Yes *sra*," the older one said. His brother just stared wide-eyed at the the
prince, the cloud, and the big wide world he'd suddenly found himself in.

It took Noxy two tries to get back onto Cloak.  Wisely, the prince didn't try to
help.  Once she was settled, he pulled himself up onto the cloud behind her and
sat quietly as they lifted into the air.

They levelled off a hundred strides above the trees and turned toward Apple
Bridge.  The soft, slightly damp feel of the cloud brought memories flooding
back to the prince. The last time he had flown had been two years ago. A lot had
changed since then, but not the thrill of being able to see the whole world at
once: the apple orchards, the hackthorn bushes in their summer finery, a trio of
deer by a stream, a farmer shading his eyes to look up as they passed...

And there, in the distance, the Blight.  Centuries ago, the Pilots had dumped
their magical waste there, from spells gone wrong to enchanted creatures so
dangerous that even the Pilots were afraid of them.  At its center lay Fast
Lake, where a year might pass for every day in the normal world.  Around it, the
land was---strange.  Some parts were completely barren, while others were
crowded with pencil trees whose limbs swayed in time to music no human being had
ever heard.  Chaghan lay on the far side, three days' hard ride for anyone brave
enough to cut across a few outlying patches of Blighted land, or a week for
those who didn't want to risk a stray gust of tainted wind turning their eyes to
glass.

He glanced sidelong at Noxy.  She still had the thick club braid and quick smile
he remembered from his time in Stale, but her legs hadn't been that long, had
they?

He jumped slightly when Noxy said, "So, you're pretty good at giving orders
these days."

The prince shrugged. "Thanks," he said, his voice breaking again. "But Sergeant
Gyalpa is really in charge.  You'll meet him when we get to town. And Sergeant
Ranneda too---she's our magician. Mostly I just try to stay out of their way."

"Well, you sounded pretty convincing to me," Noxy said. She lowered her voice
half an octave. "You two keep an eye out."

The prince smiled and cleared his throat. "I never go *looking* for trouble," he
said in a falsetto voice.

"I don't sound like that!" Noxy said indignantly.

The prince laughed.  "No, but it's the closest I can get."  He glanced down at
the road again and settled himself a bit more comfortably. "How's your mother?"

It was Noxy's turn to shrug. "She's all right, I guess.  She says she's happy to
be herding again."

The prince nodded. "I was surprised to hear she was no longer mayor."

"A lot of people are still angry about what happened," Noxy said, her eyes on
the horizon.  "When Rind said she was going to stand, *amma* said they didn't
have to bother with a vote.  She says she's glad someone else is worrying about
everything, but I think she misses it."

"I know how she feels," the prince said. "I'm glad to be away from all the fuss
at court, but I still miss it sometimes."

"Is Kulbinder here?" Noxy asked after a few moments of silence. "Your letter
didn't say. It would be good to see him again."

The prince shook his head. "He's with my brother now."

Noxy frowned. "Why? I thought he liked you."

The prince brushed a nonexistent bit of dirt off his uniform jacket. "He
probably does, but Lormay's the heir now."  He couldn't quite keep the
bitterness out of his voice when he continued.  "My father said it would make it
clear to everyone that things have changed. Sending me to Apple Bridge is part
of that too. He said that since I'm never going to rule the kingdom, I have to
find ways to serve it."

"You didn't say anything about that in your letters," Noxy ventured hesitantly.

The corner of the prince's mouth twisted. "I couldn't be sure who was going to
read them."

Noxy flushed. "I never showed them to anyone!" she protested. "Not even Granna
Fee!"

"I don't mean that," the prince apologized hastily. "It's the court I worry
about.  That's the other reason I like being here---nobody's watching everything
I do and gossipping about everything I say."

"That must have been awful," Noxy said.

The prince shrugged again. "That's politics."

They rode in silence before the prince cleared his throat.  "And what
about... you know.  You can still head-talk to clouds from far away?"

"Mind-talk," Noxy corrected automatically.  "And yes, I can still do it."  She
closed her eyes and took a slow breath.  "I can still mind-hear the cloud Rind
is riding, and the rest of the herd too.  And over there."  She pointed without
opening her eyes.  "There are some wild clouds over there somewhere."

"Have you told anyone?"  Noxy shook her head.  The prince waited a heartbeat for
her to speak.  When she didn't, he nodded.  "All right," he promised.  "Our
secret."

## Apple Bridge

The sun was sitting on the horizon like a fat yellow hen by the time Apple
Bridge came into view.  The town was home to twenty times as many people as
Stale, but seemed small to Noxy after some of the cities she had flown over.

Most of the buildings were two or three stories tall. Their ground floors were
brick and their upper stories wooden, while their roofs were shingled with long
planks bleached gray by the weather and the years.  The smell of cooking rising
from their chimneys made Noxy's stomach rumble.

Most of the town lay on the right bank of the Trout River.  Where it bent toward
the distant sea, four enormous stone pillars left over from the time of the
Pilots rose from the water.  Thick timber beams laid on top of them formed the
covered bridge that gave the town its name.

At the near end of the bridge, inside the river bend, lay a cobbled square. Even
from on high, Noxy could hear the sound of stalls being shuttered and wagons
being loaded as the town's famous Dog Market began to close for the night.

A three-story figure eight stood guard a few blocks away.  "That's the garrison
house," the prince said, pointing.  "My sister and I live upstairs in the north
wing.  The jurister stays there when she's in town too.  The sergeants and
stewards have the ground floor.  The rest is storerooms and stables and the
soldiers' quarters."

"And that's the dam?" Noxy pointed upriver where another four pillars cast long
shadows.  The wooden walkway built on them was smaller than the bridge by the
square, but still sturdy enough to support the weigh of a dozen chain-link nets.
Royal magicians had kept spells on those nets for almost two hundred years to
stop things from the Blight floating downriver.

The prince nodded. "The soldiers go up there every day to see what's washed up.
Most of it is junk, but every once in a while..."  He shrugged.  The land
downriver from them was lush and green, but only a few stunted brambles grew
upstream where the magical outwash from Fast Lake piled up.

"It must be a lot of work to keep it going.  Ulfmaerr---" Noxy paused.  "My
grandfather said magicians' spells usually fade away when they do."  *Like he
did,* she thought sadly.  The last time her grandfather had come to Stale he had
no longer been able to cut his own food or tie up his own boots.  His eyes had
been as bright as ever, but had darted helplessly from face to face as he tried
to remember people's names. That had been a year ago. No-one had seen him since.
No-one expected to.

The prince pretended not to notice the change in Noxy's voice. "It is," he said.
"The magician who was here before Sergeant Ranneda managed to refresh it a few
years ago, but it cost her the sight in one eye."  He shook his head. "I know
they're all volunteers, but it's still a lot to ask."

"Cheerful as always," Noxy grumbled jokingly.

They landed in the rear courtyard of the garrison house. A middle-aged soldier
with a bushy mustache stood waiting for them. He had two wide black ribbons sewn
onto his sleeve, deep wrinkles near the corners of his eyes, shoulders that
seemed to be as wide as he was tall, and no more expression than a stone.

"Your Highness," he said, snapping a salute as the prince slid off Cloak.

"Sergeant Gyalpa," the prince acknowledged, wiping his hands on his uniform
before returning the salute.  "Allow me to present Probably Noxious of Stale.
She will be staying with us until it is well enough to travel again."

"Honored Noxious." The sergeant bowed formally.

"Please, just call me Noxy," she replied, bowing awkwardly in return.  She
appreciated him keeping a straight face---she knew how odd cloudherds' names
sounded to lowlanders.  Even in the capital, people had sniggered when Rind
introduced herself as Rotting Melon Rind.  "We'll see who's laughing when the
dragons hatch," Rind had said darkly.  "We'll see if *their* names save *them*
from being eaten."

"I take it the soldiers beat me back?" the prince said.

Sergeant Gyalpa nodded.  "Yes *sra*.  They said a farm was near by completely
destroyed.  The woman they had by them said her son-by-marriage came along into
Apple Bridge today to report some suspicious men.  He left going on about an
hour.  I sent along out some riders, but he's not on by the road."

The prince frowned, trying to guess what the sergeant would think was the right
thing to do.  "He may have gone down the south road instead of straight home,"
he ventured.  "Send another couple of riders to look---it would be best if he
didn't get home to find that he no longer has one."

"Yes *sra*," the sergeant said approvingly. He lifted the silver whistle that
hung on a fine chain around his neck and blew two short notes followed by two
long ones.  A moment later a handful of soldiers who had clearly been waiting
for just such a signal trotted onto the courtyard.

"Does the cloud need anything?" Prince Thokmay asked Noxy while the sergeant
gave the new arrivals their orders.

"Just water," Noxy said, rubbing her bruised arm.  "She'll be all right as long
as she gets some rest. But I could use a hot bath."

"Of course. I'll ask Dolly to see to it. She's my sister's nurse," he added when
Noxy raised her eyebrows. "She's used to helping people with their baths."  He
beckoned to a housemaid who had been hovering nearby, then hesitated before
adding, "It's really good to see you again."

"You too," Noxy replied, her face warm despite the early evening chill.

Prince Thokmay watched as the housemaid led Noxy away.  He should probably take
a bath before dinner too, he realized.  And find a clean shirt.  And see if
anyone knew the new Chaghan-o consul's name yet.  The outgoing one hadn't known.
"Isn't that unusual?" he had asked.

The consul had spread her hands helplessly---a gesture she seemed to use
whenever anyone asked her for anything specific.  "Some clerk was probably
supposed to send a note," she said blandly.  "I'm sure it will all be fine."

But instead of heading to his rooms, he clasped his hands behind his back and
closed his eyes, trying to imagine what it would be like to mind-hear the way
Noxy did.  A *clang* from the kitchen was someone getting a pot down from its
hook on the wall to make dinner.  A duller *clonk, clonk, clonk* from the
building behind him might be the smith mending a sword or bending a horseshoe
into shape.  The occasional *thock!* and curse from the other courtyard was
archery practice---Sergeant Gyalpa had been scathing about the local standard of
marksmanship when they had first arrived, and his opinion hadn't gone up much in
the months since.

"Am I interrupting, Your Highness?" the sergeant asked from behind him.

The prince jumped.  "No!  I mean, not really.  Any word from Sergeant Ranneda?"

"Yes *sra*," the sergeant said.  "She and her troop got along back this
afternoon.  They were gone six days, near as they can figure."

"Six days?" The prince blinked. "They must have gone closer to the lake than she
planned."

"Yes *sra*," the sergeant nodded. "They found fresh tracks along by the bank of
the river.  She said they looked as made by a wagon or such."

"A wagon?  You think the smugglers are working that far in?" the prince asked.
Sergeant Gyalpa grunted noncommittally. "All right.  Tell her I'll speak with
her in the morning.  In the morning," he repeated as the sergeant opened his
mouth.  "She needs a good night's sleep, and I need a bath."

"Yes *sra*," Sergeant Gyalpa replied, his face as expressionless as ever.

At that same moment, a few blocks away, a hairy, long-armed figure slurped the
last of his tea in a small shop on the edge of the Dog Market.  He was the
shop's only customer---a few people had stuck their heads in after he had taken
a table, but all had decided to go elsewhere.  The shop's tea blender glowered
behind his counter, arms folded.

"Ah... Delicious.  My compliments on your choice of leaves."  The hairy figure
stood, adjusted the glasses perched on his snub nose, and dropped a few coppers
on the table.  "I will *definitely* return."  Ignoring the tea blender's
muttered curse, he sauntered out into the waning afternoon light.

As the stalls in the Dog Market finished packing up, the wealthier merchants
whose shops stood on its perimeter folded down awnings and fastened shutters.
Unsold vegetables were thrown onto two-wheeled scrap wagons and stacked bales of
wool were lifted onto wagons to be taken back to warehouses.  A handful of
farmers interrupted their discussion of the day's barley prices to stare at the
troll as he waddled across the cobblestones.  "Good evening and good morrow," he
said cheerfully, nodding to them and continuing on without waiting for a reply
that never came.

He had just reached the market gate when a piebald horse suddenly whinnied and
reared up on her hind legs.  "Hold still!"  barked the burly man trying to
harness her between his wagon's draw poles.  "Stupid creature!"  He slapped her
hard across her nose.

The horse reared again, almost pulling her reins out of the farmer's hands.
Rough-edged bricks spilled out of the back of the wagon.  Cursing, the man
yanked drew a willow switch from his belt.  "I said hold *still*!"  He raised
his arm to whip the horse---

---and grunted in surprise as a hairy hand grasped his wrist.  "Now, now,"
chided the troll.  "Let's just think on this for a moment, shall we?  Do unto
others and all that."

"Let go of me, you filthy beast!"  The farmer tried to yank his arm away, but
the troll's grip was like iron.  "I said let go, or I'll give *you* a whipping
too!"

The troll smiled, revealing strong white teeth.  "I doubt that.  And if your
friend comes any closer with that cudgel, I won't be gentle about taking it away
from him."  The man who had been edging up behind the troll stopped short, but
tightened his grip on the stout length of hickory in his hands.

The market had gone silent around the threesome.  The troll let go of the farmer
and wiped his hand ostentatiously on his carefully-combed pelt.  "There, you
see?" he said cheerfully.  "Your horse has calmed down.  It does usually only
take a bit of patience.  Now, let me wish you good evening and---"

A potato flew by his head.  A second one bounced off his arm.  Suddenly the air
was full of eggs and stones and vegetables.  "Skin him!" someone shouted.  "Skin
him!"

The crowd took up the cry.  Suddenly bold, the farmer swung his switch, then
yelped in surprise as he was thrown through the air to crash against a nearby
stall.  The troll spun around just in time to catch the cudgel swung at his
head.  Another yelp was followed by another crash as the troll threw the second
man after the first.

The troll charged into the crowd.  People threw themselves out of his way as he
ran clumsily for the market gate.  "Out of my way!" he yelled, waving one arm
and holding his glasses in place with the other.  He ducked under a roll of
canvas, said, "Excuse me!" to a woman with half a dozen loaves of bread piled in
her arms, scrambled up the gate post, swung himself onto the roof beside it, and
scampered away.

Meanwhile, Prince Thokmay had just closed the door to his room behind him.  A
clean dress shirt was waiting on his pillow and his town boots had been polished
and set at the foot of his bed.  He shrugged off his heavy uniform jacket to
hang it on the tailor's dummy that stood in the corner, then peeled off his
shirt and tossed it into the wicker pail under his bed.  With a quick glance to
make sure no one was watching, he stood in front of his mirror and studied
himself critically.  His shoulders were definitely broader than they had been
six months ago---well, probably.  He wondered if Noxy had noticed.  He had
certainly noticed the way she had changed shape since he had last seen her...

*Rap rap rap!* He jumped at the urgent knock on his window.  "Your Highness!"
panted a familiar voice.  "Might I enter?  I find myself in rather a spot of
trouble."

"Not again," the prince sighed.  He unlatched the window's iron-and-bamboo
shutter and opened the quartered glass pane, then stepped back as the troll
swung itself into his room.

"Thank you, Your Highness," his tutor puffed.  He stood and straightened his
glasses.  "May I suggest that it would perhaps be prudent to re-bar my ingress,
so as not to betray my route to passers by?  Some of whom might regrettably be
in rather foul moods?"

"If you mean close the window so people don't know which way you came,
certainly," the prince said, shaking his head as he did just that.  "So what did
you do *this* time?"

The troll laid his hand on his chest and blinked innocently.  "I merely
attempted to give one of your loyal citizens a lesson on how best to care for
their fellow creatures."

"In other words, you were arguing with someone about their animals?"  The prince
shook his head again.  "Mope, you have to stop doing this."

"I'll stop when they do," the troll said, the humor suddenly gone from his
voice.  "He was whipping the poor creature, Your Highness.  Whipping her!"

"Was she Gifted?"

"That's irrelevant!"  The prince's tutor waved an arm to emphasize his point.
"And it was hardly her fault she was being skittish---some idiot flew a cloud
right over the town this afternoon and scared us all half out of our wits, man
and beast.  *That's* who deserves a whipping!"

"Ah."  The prince coughed.  "About that..."

He eventually managed to interrupt the mild scolding that followed and shoo his
tutor out the door so that he could finish dressing.  As he struggled with the
laces at his cuffs, he studied the family portrait that hung on his wall.  His
father stood in the center in a richly embroidered uniform with the
gold-and-turquoise collar of Gandan securely around his neck and his second wife
beside him in a matching jacket and long flowing trousers.  His youngest son,
Prince Thokmay, stood in front of the king wearing a copy of the royal collar to
show the world that he was the heir.  Prince Thokmay and Princess Ogmin stood to
either side, hands clasped behind their backs.  Two years ago, Thokmay and
Jokmin's positions had been reversed.  He wondered if his brother thought about
that as often as he did.

## Familiar Faces

*She could have told me she was going to watch,* Noxy thought as she lowered
herself self-consciously into the steaming water.

"Warm enough, miss?" Dolly asked, stirring the coals in the tub's hotbox.  Her
head only came up to Noxy's shoulders, but her arms were longer than Noxy's
legs. Her orange-brown fur was speckled with gray, and her eyes were sad and
wise.

"Yes, thank you," Noxy said. "It's wonderful."  It was actually almost too hot
to bear, but she could feel the ache in her injured arm start to soften.

Dolly smiled. "I'm sure it is, after all you've been through. Now, let me have a
look at that. No, please, don't try to get up, just sit forward a bit. That's
good... that's good... My, that *is* a nasty bruise, isn't it?  You're lucky it
wasn't broken.  Does it hurt when I---I'm sorry. How about this way?"  She
clucked her tongue, then went over to the cabinet next to the window and
rummaged around. "I'm *sure* I've got some left," she said to herself.

Noxy looked around the room as the troll sniffed the contents of various jars
and bottles. The walls were painted a soft yellow. The cabinet, the standing
mirror, and the chair and matching footstool were all made of darkly varnished
wood, with legs that curved inward slightly like a bowlegged sailor's. The only
other decoration was a framed needlepoint of an eagle atop a pole with its wings
spread. Noxy wondered idly if it was landing or taking off, or just shaking off
the rain.

"That's Her Highness's work," Dolly said, noticing Noxy's gaze. "She's a fine
one with a needle."

Noxy hesitated. "The prince told me she was..."  She trailed off, not knowing
exactly what to say.

"Simple?" Dolly finished, undisturbed. "She is that.  But she's as sweet as
anyone you'll ever meet. Now give me that arm and let me put some of this on
you. It won't hurt.  Pilots know I've done it often enough for Her
Highness---it's a rare week she doesn't have some spill or other."

Noxy was thankful that Dolly left her alone to dress in the pale yellow blouse
and gray floor-length skirt that a housemaid had delivered while she was
soaking. The skirt felt drafty---mountain women only wore them for weddings,
funerals, and fancies---but when she wiped steam from the mirror to look at
herself, the clothes' soft colors set off her dark brown skin perfectly.

She dithered for a moment before setting aside the dainty wooden court shoes
that had come with the clothes. *No sense breaking my neck on the stairs,* she
told herself as she pulled on her sturdy mountain boots instead.  After tying
her braids back in a thick club, she set out to see what she could find to quiet
her grumbling stomach.

The dining room on the floor below had the largest window Noxy had ever seen.  A
handful of places were set at the table that stood in front of it, each with a
bewildering confusion of bamboo and silver cutlery.

Prince Thokmay folded the report he had been reading and tucked it back into his
sleeve as she entered.  "Good evening, *sra*," hse said solemnly, bowing.  Noxy
hesitated, not knowing if she was supposed to bow back, but then Thokmay winked.

She scowled to hide her blush.  "Don't be such a troll."

"Why not?" asked a voice behind her.  "I think it's a fine thing to be."

Noxy spun around.  The troll who had just entered the room sketched an elaborate
court bow.  A small pair of glasses with heavy brass rims perched precariously
on his tiny snub of a nose. His gray jacket set off his orange fur perfectly,
and his smile seemed friendly rather than threatening despite the mouthful of
teeth it revealed.

The prince cleared his throat.  "Um, Probably Noxious of Stale, allow me to
present my tutor, the Learned Mope."

"A pleasure to meet you, *sra*---the prince has spoken of you often," the troll
said, offering his hand.

"Learned Mope is Dolly's son," Prince Thokmay explained to Noxy, his voice
cracking mid-sentence. "He's supposed to be teaching me law and history."

"He's actually not a bad student," the troll told Noxy in a stage whisper,
shaking her hand. "He has a fine memory. He just don't know how to think
yet. Logic!  Logic is the key." He waggled a finger.  "Logic and eloquence.  And
facts, of course.  One must have facts as fuel for one's arguments..."

Noxy tried to seem interested as the troll embarked on a long story about how an
inspired bit of logic by someone she had never heard of had once prevented a war
between two countries she was pretty sure no longer existed.  It became harder
after the steward stole the prince away with an urgent question about salad
dressings and the placement of lanterns---all she could think about was what the
trolls who lived in the forest around Stale would have thought about one of
their kind wearing clothes and quoting poetry.

As Mope's stored meandered from one obscure life lesson to another, a young
woman slipped into the room and made a beeline for the tray of pies on the side
table beneath the window.  She wore a more elaborate version of the blouse and
skirt that Noxy had been given, and had the prince's round face, but instead of
being cropped close, her hair hung in a dozen long braids, each ending in a
small yellow bow.

"You've met Her Highness, I trust?"  the troll asked, interrupting himself
without missing a beat.

"Um, nope.  I mean, I haven't had the pleasure," Noxy replied, trying to imitate
the voice her mother used on official occasions.

"Well, no time like the presen," Mope said.  He shooed her forward. "Your
Highness?  Pincess Ogmin?"

The princess shook her head as they approached, counting slowly.  "Four, five,
six---there are six people for dinner tonight!" she announced proudly.

The troll straightened his glasses.  "Quite possibly, Your Highness, though
logically the most we can conclude is that there will be *at most* six people.
But no matter, no matter," he added hastily as she frowned.  "Have you met the
Honored Noxious? She's a friend of your brother."

"H'lo," the princess mumbled, suddenly shy.

"Hello, Your Highness," Noxy said. The silence stretched awkwardly.  As Mope
opened his mouth to break it, Noxy asked, "Do you always wear nice shoes?"

Princess Ogmin looked at her feet. Her wooden court shoes were dark blue with
golden roses chasing one another across the top. "No?"  Princess Ogmin said,
still shy.

"Me neither," Noxy told her. She tugged her skirt up to reveal the toes of her
scuffed mountain boots. "I was afraid I'd trip and fall down the stairs if I
tried to wear anything fancy, so I wore these instead."

The princess's eyes widened. She giggled. "Look!" she whispered loudly to Mope,
pointing.  "She's wearing *boots*!"

The troll grinned. "Yes she is," he agreed.  "And very nice boots they are,
wouldn't you say?"

After that, Princess Ogmin couldn't stop talking. By the time Sergeant Gyalpa
arrived to rescue the prince from the steward, she had told Noxy about her
riding boots, her dolls, and the needlework she was making for her brother's
birthday. ("But don't tell him," Princess Ogmin whispered loudly, "It's a
secret.")

The steward returned a few moment later to announce that the consul from Chaghan
had arrived with her replacement and was begging the prince's grace to join the
court for dinner.  "The court?"  Noxy asked after Mope excused himself.

The prince gestured at his sister, who had gone shy again as soon as the steward
spoke.  "Whenever two members of the royal family are in the same place, it's a
court."

"The Honored Yisu Chaghan-o, consul," the steward said loudly.  A portly woman
in a formal black coat trimmed with Chaghan's sky blue strode into the room, a
practiced smile fixed on her face.  "And the Honored Nangyal Chaghan-o,
consul-to-be," the steward continued in the same voice.

Noxy looked over the woman's shoulder as the name registered.  Her stomach went
cold.  "It can't be..." she whispered.  She grabbed the prince's arm.
"Thokmay---look!"

The forced smile on the prince's face dropped like a hanged man.  "What---what
in the underhells are *you* doing here?" he demanded angrily, his voice
cracking.

The man that Noxy and the prince had once known as Scholar-Candidate Nangyal
stopped and bowed deeply.  "Your Highness," he said in an oily voice.  "How good
to see you again."  He straightened, pointedly ignoring Noxious.

"I---I take it you've met?" Consul Yisu asked brightly in the awkward silence
that followed.

"Unfortunately," Prince Thokmay grated. "He murdered a friend of mine."

Noxy stared at the man her whole village had once mocked for being the least
competent magician they'd ever seen, only to discover that he was both talented
and a spy.  Nangyal was thinner than he had been two years ago, and his hair was
starting to gray.  Noxy hoped it was more than just age.  She hoped those two
years had been as hard for him as they'd been for Fernando, whose broken leg had
healed crookedly, or for Ulfmaerr, who had given up so much of himself to help
her and Prince Thokmay escape.  She hoped he had nightmares, like she sometimes
still did, but in her heart, she knew he didn't.

Nangyal coughed.  "I don't wish to begin my tenure as consul by disagreeing with
my host, but Sergeant Dorbu's death was not murder."

"Not murder!?"  "Consul!?"  Noxy and Prince Thokmay exclaimed at the same time.
"How can you be consul? You're not Chaghan-o!" the prince continued.

"I am now," Nangyal replied smugly, pulling an envelope tied with a sky blue
ribbon from the sleeve of his formal coat and offering it to the prince.

Thokmay snatched it from his hand and tore off the ribbon, his clenched jaw
making the scars on his face glisten.  He read the letter of introduction and
then read it again.

"Thokmay---" Princess Ogmin started.  Mope shushed her.  "But I don't
*understand*," she whispered loudly.  "What's happening?"

The prince folded the letter in half and thrust it at Consul Yisu.  "This is
unacceptable!" he said furiously.  "The kingdom does not accept this... this
*person* as consul."

Behind him, Mope cleared his throat.  "With respect, Your Highness, perhaps we
should take a moment and---"

The prince rounded on him.  "He threw Sergeant Dorbu off a cliff!"

Nangyal sighed theatrically.  "I did not throw the sergeant off anything, Your
Highness.  We were fighting.  It was difficult terrain, and he fell.  I'm sorry
it happened.  I'm sorry for every single person or Gifted beast that died that
day."

"Sorry enough to come back to Stale for trial?" Noxy burst out.

The scholar turned spy pursed his lips.  "Do you think I would receive a fair
hearing?"

Noxy's hands bunched into fists.  "A fair---you don't deserve any kind of
hearing!"

"Perhaps we should all take a breath," Consul Yisu said in a nannying tone.  Her
smile hadn't faltered, but she hadn't taken back the letter.  "Your Highness,
the court in Chaghan would be very disappointed if Gandan were to reject their
chosen consul.  It could make negotiations over the management of the Blight
quite difficult."

Before the prince could reply, the steward rang a small bell.  "Dinner is
served," he announced nervously.

Prince Thokmay slowly lowered his arm, Nangyal's letter of introduction still in
his hand.  "Please excuse me, Honored Yisu," he said quietly. "But I find I am
suddenly feeling unwell.  Perhaps we could reschedule dinner for some other
time?"

"Of course, Your Highness," Yisu replied, bowing again.  "I completely
understand.  I would be happy to delay my departure until you feel better."

Noxy waited until the door had closed behind the two Chaghan-o before bursting
out, "You can't let him stay!  He killed Sergeant Dorbu!"

The prince nodded, his face years older than it had been just minutes ago.  "I
know.  But that letter is genuine---he really is the new consul.  And my father
is counting on me to reach a deal with Chaghan about patrolling the Blight."

Sergeant Gyalpa had been standing at attention near one end of the dinner table
throughout the exchange.  The moment the door closed behind the two visitors and
the apologetic steward, he took a deep breath and blew it out through his
mustache.  "*Sra*, if I may---"

"You may not," Prince Thokmay snapped.

"But *sra*, I---"

The prince rounded on him.  "That man killed my friend!" he snapped, his anger
boiling over.  "He terrorized Noxy's village, and more than that, he's a spy---a
spy!  What is Chaghan thinking?  It's an insult for them to make him their
consul!"

"Yes *sra*," Sergeant Gyalpa said steadily.  "That's what I was going to say.
It's an insult, and not an accidental one, and if I may, *sra*, I think you
handled it very well."

The prince blinked, nonplussed.  "Oh.  Well.  Thank you, sergeant."

Princess Ogmin eventually broke the silence that followed.  "Are we still going
to have pie?" she asked hesitantly, then look startled when everyone laughed.

In the end Prince Thokmay declared that he was feeling much better, and that it
would be a shame to waste the kitchen's hard work.  The house staff served spicy
squash soup and skewers of grilled vegetables and salty cheese.  The pies that
followed were as delicious as they looked.

Afterward, Prince Thokmay sent his sister gently off to bed.  "Would you like to
sit on the balcony for a bit?"  he asked Noxy once she was gone.  "I'm sure the
cook would be happy to mull some cider."

The balcony turned out to be on the top floor of the garrison house. The Trout
River stretched away to the left and the right, up toward the magic dam and down
through Gandan and Latter Tongsa to the sea.  Moonlight gleamed on each little
ripple, and suddenly Noxy missed the million sharp stars of the mountain sky.

A bell went *dong, dong, dong* slowly somewhere on the other side of the river.
"Third watch," the prince observed, sliding a little lower in his chair.
"Sergeant Gyalpa had me do some night watches when we first got here, just so
I'd know what it was like for the soldiers.  It was actually kind of fun---turns
out it's a lot easier getting up in the middle of the night than getting out of
bed in the morning."

"We take turns sleeping when we're on long flights," Noxy said, warming her
hands on her mug of cider.  "As long as a couple of people are awake to keep the
herd moving, the rest will follow."

"Are you enjoying it?" Thokmay asked.

Noxy smiled.  "I love it."  She hesitated.  "And---how about you?  Are you
enjoying...?"  She trailed off, not knowing how to finish her sentence.

The prince studied his cider.  "Actually, after I got back to Gandan, I thought
for a while about becoming a doctor."

"A doctor?" Noxy said. "But---you're a boy!"

"Boys can be doctors," the prince said defensively.  "Anyway, my father said
that one more doctor more or less wouldn't make much difference in the world.
So here I am, learning how to command soldiers and argue the law."

"Do you ever regret what you did?" Noxy asked. She'd wanted to ask in her
letters, but had never known how to.

"Not really." He sounded distant, as if they were talking about someone he had
lost touch with long ago. "It needed to be done. That's really all there is to
it.  And I think my mother would have been proud of me.  But it's hard for
Ogmin. She's not... she's not very good with things changing. She had to sleep
in my room the first month we were here. She kept waking up in the middle of the
night because she couldn't hear the castle bell ringing."

"But why is she here?"

"It needed to be done," the prince said again. "If you send one royal away, it
looks like exile.  Send two, and you can call it a court."  The prince drained
his cider.  "My father *says* that her presence is a sign that he trusts me, but
I don't feel like I'm ready for that kind of trust, not really."

They sipped their cider in silence.  Finally Thokmay sighed. "I'm sorry. It's
been a long day, and I have a letter to write. Please sleep in as late as you
want.  And if you'd like to go to the Dog Market with Ogmin tomorrow, I'm sure
she'd be happy to show you her favorite pie stall."

"That sounds like fun," Noxy said. She drained the last of her cider and stood.

The prince hurriedly stood as well.  They looked at each other, neither quite
knowing what to do next, until the prince cleared his throat.  "So, good night."

"Good night," Noxy said awkwardly.  Her breath caught when the prince reached
out, but he was only opening the door to let her back into the garrison house.
"Good night," she repeated, turning and leaving him on the balcony with all the
moment's might-have-beens.

*On the other side of the garrison house, a hairy hand unlatched a window.  Its
owner waited a moment to see if anyone had noticed, but only heard the usual
sounds of servants finishing late-night chores, soldiers gossipping as they
stood watch, and a cat meowing to be let in.*

*Climbing onto the roof took only a moment.  A long leap ending in a reach and a
flip, and the troll was across the street and away...*

*A few minutes later, a piebald horse was awakened by a gentle hand stroking her
flank. "Sh, sh," whispered a voice. "Oh, look what they've done to you." Enraged
and embarrassed after the scene in the market, her owner had laid into her
flanks with his willow switch, leaving angry welts.*

*She whinnied softly as her midnight visitor slipped a halter over her
head. "Sh, sh...  Quietly now, come along."  The horse followed obediently as
the troll led her out of the stable behind the inn where her bruised master had
found a room for the night.*

*The inn's yard was empty.  Only the stars, the scarred moon, and an attentive
crow watched the pair make their way across the inn's little courtyard to a
muddy alley.*

*As they reached it, the crow swooped low over their heads.  The horse
side-stepped, startled.  "Sorry!" the crow squawked.*

*"Sh!" the troll hissed.*

*"Sorry," the crow repeated more quietly.  "There's a couple of night-soil
collectors along down Trumpet Street, but that's all."*

*"Thank you." The crow bobbed its head and took wing again, fluttering from
building to building as the troll led horse way through the alley to a run-down
warehouse on the banks of the Trout.*

*The freshly-oiled hinges of the warehouse's door made no more sound than the
window latch had.  Inside, a cheap dayglass lantern cast just enough
reddish-orange light to reveal a pair of raccoons and---*

*The horse shied again as the bear rose to its feet and ambled toward her.  "Sh,
sh, sh..."  The troll stroked her muzzle.  "It's all right, it's all right,
nobody's going to hurt you, not here, not ever."*

*"You know she doesn't understand you," the bear rumbled.*

*"She understands what I mean," the troll replied sharply.  "Is the barge still
coming in tomorrow?"*

*"If it hasn't sunk.  Or been pirated.  Or caught fire."  The bear stepped aside
to let the troll lead the horse to the back of the warehouse where half a bag of
pilfered oats waited for her.  The raccoons stood on their hind legs and pushed
the door closed.*

*The troll stroked the horse's muzzle one last time.  "Don't worry.  No one is
ever going to put a halter on you again."  Without waiting for an answer that
the ungifted animal would never be able to give, the troll climbed a post, swung
along a beam, and disappeared out a window into the night.  The air was chill,
and morning would arrive all too soon, but there was one more chore to be
done...*

As the crow tucked its head under its wing on a rafter above the horse, Prince
Thokmay was sitting down at his desk.  He had unbuttoned his uniform jacket but
kept it on for warmth---the light from the little dayglass lantern by his elbow
was midday-yellow, but held no heat at all.

He frowned at the sheet of paper before him.  *Your Majesty,* his letter began,
as his reports to his father always did. *1.  Apple Bridge continues quiet. The
Dog Market is busy, but your revenue collectors report only minor disputes and
disturbances.* He saw no reason to mention Mope's latest run-in with the locals.

*2. The tornado has struck again. No soldiers' lives were lost, but one man is
still missing, and a prosperous smallholding was destroyed.  I have still not
been able to discover who is directing it.* The prince had hesitated before
calling the little out-of-the-way farm "prosperous". He didn't think that his
father's hawk-eyed accountants would quibble over what the prince was planning
to spend to rebuild it, but Mope always told him to think two moves ahead.

*3. A cloud was injured in the same attack. Its rider is to remain here with it
until it is able to rejoin its herd.* He had almost chewed the end off his quill
writing those two sentences.  After what had happened two years ago, he doubted
his father would be happy knowing that Noxy was in Apple Bridge.  He wanted his
brother to know even less. The first time Noxy had written Thokmay a letter,
Jokmin had run through the palace holding it in the air, crowing, "Thokmay has a
sweetheart!  Thokmay has a sweetheart!"  The older prince had knocked over a
potted lime tree and two elderly surveyors catching up with him, and lost his
riding privileges taken away for a week for blackening his brother's eye.
Jokmin had made a point of sneering at cloudherds ever since.

He sighed, then froze at an echoing sigh behind him.  *Breathe naturally,* he
told himself as he slid his left hand up to the dagger at his belt. Slowly,
slooowwwllyyy...

Something thumped on the floor.  The prince leaped to his feet, knocking over
his chair as he drew his dagger.  The ghost of a small dog looked at him for a
moment, then threw back his head and howled.

The sound went through the prince's head like an icy spear. He clapped his hands
over his ears, nearly taking off his nose with his dagger as the lantern on his
desk shattered.

The ghost lowered its head and growled, ears back. The prince yelped and slashed
instinctively as the apparition suddenly charged. His whole body went cold for
an instant as the ghost passed through him and disappeared through the wall.

The prince collapsed onto the edge of his desk, shivering uncontrollably.  His
dagger slipped from his numb fingers and clattered on the floor.

The door burst open a moment later. "Your Highness!"  Someone shook him. "Your
Highness, are you all right?"

"I'm fine," Prince Thokmay mumbled. He let out his breath with a whoosh,
half-expecting to see it make a fog. "It was Badam.  He was here."

"Pilots preserve us."  The servant let go of the prince's shoulders.  Was his
name Apsu? The prince couldn't remember, though he prided himself on knowing
names.  He suddenly felt exhausted.

Boots pounded in the planked stone corridor. "Your Highness, are you all by
right?"  Sergeant Ranneda asked before pulling herself up short and sniffing the
air. "There's been a ghost along here," the garrison's magician said flatly.

The prince nodded. "I know," he mumbled, still shivering.  Disconnected thoughts
and images were surfacing in his mind like drowned bodies rising to the surface
of a stagnant pond.  He choked back nausea.  "I think---I think he's trying to
warn us about something."

"About what, Your Highness?"  *Abasu,* the prince recalled fuzzily.  *The
servant's name is Abasu.* He shook his head.  The images---they weren't his
memories, they were the ghost's, and they were all the wrong shape and size and
flavor.  Thinking about them was like trying to choke down cold cauliflower
soup...

"Clear by," Sergeant Gyalpa said roughly, pushing past the servants standing in
the hallway.  He was wearing his boots and a striped cotton nightshirt, and had
his sword in his hand. "Your Highness, are you---"

"It was Badam come along," Sergeant Ranneda told him.  She picked up a shard of
dayglass from the desk and turned it over in her hand.  "He's getting stronger."

Sergeant Gyalpa scowled and lowered his sword. "Get back to bed," he ordered the
servants. "Nothing more is going to happen along by here tonight."

He waited until they were gone before putting his hand on the prince's shoulder.
"If you need to yark, lad, go ahead.  Most do, their first time along this
sort."

Prince Thokmay shook his head, feeling merely dizzy instead of nauseous.  The
thoughts the ghost had left behind in his head were fading.  "I think..." He
swallowed.  "It's something about the bridge.  Or the dam.  And the Blight.
Something bad is coming."  He stood, steadying himself on the desk with one
hand.  "Something *really* bad."

"Omens weeping omens," Sergeant Gyalpa cursed. "Why can't he just come along and
tell us straight?"

"I'm so more worried as that he's coming clearer instead of going along fade,"
Sergeant Ranneda said, still studying the shard of dayglass in her hand.  Her
husky voice seemed at odds with her slight frame.  "Should have moved along
since ages by, before we were either born.  Why's he coming stronger?  And how?"

Prince Thokmay let out a shaky breath. "Well, whatever is giving him the
strength to stay in this world can't be good news.  I'll include a note to my
father's magicians in my letter and ask for advice." He raised a hand to
forestall Sergeant Gyalpa's objection. "It's not like I'm going to get to sleep
any time soon." He returned the two sergeants' salutes and good nights, swept
the still-glowing dayglass into a pile in the corner of his desk, and fell back
into his chair.

He could feel the long day dragging down his eyelids as he added a scribbled
summary of what had happened to his letter and signed, *Your dutiful son,
Thokmay Gandan-o Prince* below it.  He knew he should re-read it, but instead he
drew a line diagonally across the empty space at the bottom of the page, folded
the page into thirds, stumbled to his bed, kicked off his boots, and was asleep
by his third breath.

The middle of the book goes here :-)

========================================

## The Bear's Choice

Rust and her two captives floated on in silence. The only other raft they saw
was being pulled upriver by two weary donkeys led by a girl who gave them no
more than a glance.  A man and a boy sat cross-legged on the raft, the man
whittling and the boy pushing the raft away from snags every once in a while
with a long pole.

The bear ordered Prince Thokmay and Princess Ogmin into the lean-to and then sat
in front of it and grunted a hello as the raft passed by.  From their hiding
place, the prince and princess could hear the raftsmen singing a slow, sad
song. The words floated over the river like clouds in a blue summer sky.

"Sergeant Dorbu used to sing that one," Prince Thokmay whispered in his sister's
ear. "It was so beautiful, sometimes I thought the trees were going to tear out
their roots so that they could come closer and listen."

"Did they ever?" she whispered back.

The prince smiled and shook his head. "No, they never needed to. He always sang
loudly enough for them to hear."

Rust waited until they rounded the next bend before letting the prince and
princess come out. The two humans sat down near the bow once again.  A moment
later, Princess Ogmin squeaked and grabbed her brother as the raft suddenly
lurched and began bobbing up and down.

The prince looked back to see what the bear was doing, but Rust was looking back
up the river as well. "What's happening?" he asked.

"I dunno," the bear rumbled. She sniffed at the air. "But somethin's coming.
Somethin' *bad*."

First came a rushing sound like wind blowing through leaves.  A shout turned
into a cry of panic, and Thokmay had just a moment to remember the donkey-drawn
raft before a roiling two-foot crest of water swept down the Trout toward them.
The wave was darker than the river beneath it, as if it was full of
shadows. "Hold on!" Rust roared.

The wave hit the rear of the raft with the force of a padded rhinoceros. Prince
Thokmay nearly tumbled into the river as the raft tilted forward and then
righted itself. Princess Ogmin screamed in terror. Dark water from the wave had
splashed up over the rear of the raft onto the logs and formed small pools. Even
as they watched, the pools oozed together and flowed *up* over the gunwales and
back into the river.

"Don' let it touch you!" Rust said. "It's Blighted!"

The raft was going faster now. "Up ahead!" the prince said suddenly.  "Steer for
that island!" He leaped to his feet and threw his weight against the steering
board.

The raft barely budged.  Rust lumbered over to the steering board and put her
shoulder against it. Reluctantly, the raft's course began to bend toward the
little patch of land.

"More! More!" the prince called, trying to gauge their speed and direction. "A
little more! Hold it there! Brace yourself!"

The raft crashed through the reeds on the upstream side of the island and ground
to a halt in its muddy bank. Rust stumbled but kept her footing. The prince, the
princess, and everything that wasn't tied down slid off the raft and into the
knee-high bushes that covered the island.

The dark water raced past on either side of them, tugging at the raft as they
scrambled to their feet. Rust barely had time to leap onto the island before
their little craft was pulled away.

"What's happening?" Princess Ogmin asked, frightened and bewildered.  She
started to cry.  "What's happening, May?"

The prince put his arm around her shoulder.  "Sh, sh," he soothed her.  "It's
all right, Oggie, it's all right, we're safe."  He caught the bear's eye.
"We're safe here."

"That was Blightwater," the bear rumbled.  "Somethin' musta happened to th'
dam."  She reared up on her hind legs to get a last glimpse of the raft, then
fell back on all fours and sighed. "That's the last we'll see of our food or
your blankets."

Thokmay forced a smile. "I guess we're all prisoners now."  The bear growled but
said nothing.  The prince gave his sister another squeeze.  "Come on---let's
tidy this up."

A few loose boards, some rope, the sacks they had used as pillows, and the
firepot were all they were able to salvage.  Thokmay laid the boards on top of
some bushes and piled everything else on top of them, all the while studying the
river and the bear out of the corner of his eye.  It was only thirty strides to
the bank.  He could easily swim that, but Ogmin could only dog paddle, and Rust
would easily catch them if they tried.

*If we dared,* the prince thought despondently.  The wave that had wrecked the
raft had disappeared downriver, but dark shadows still swirled hungrily in the
water around their little island.  When he broke a twig off a tree and threw it
into the river, something pulled it down with a soft *gloop*.  It didn't
resurface.  The prince exchanged looks with Rust.  Their only hope was to stay
put and wait for a passing boat or barge to rescue them.

"Look!" Princess Ogmin suddenly said, pointing upstream. "Someone's coming!"

It took the prince a moment to figure out what he was seeing. At first he
thought it was some kind of bird, but then he realized it was a man skipping or
hopping twenty yards at a time.  His heart sank as the figure came closer.  It
was Nangyal.

"What in th' hells is *he* doing here?" Rust snarled.

"Sh, be polite," Prince Thokmay told her, feeling almost giddy. "He *is* your
business partner."

Another dozen lopsided steps brought the plump spy to the little island.  "Well
hello!" Nangyal said jauntily. His jacket was torn and muddied, and there were
dark circles under his eyes. He held up a lock of Princess Ogmin's hair. "Glad
to see it still works."

"What are you doin' here?" Rust growled. "We had a deal."

"Yes we did," Nangyal nodded vigorously. He looked around. "You also had a raft,
didn't you? What happened to it?"

"What happened to the dam?" Prince Thokmay broke in. "We saw the wave..."

"Oh, the dam, the dam," Nangyal said with a wave of his hand. "I'm sure it's
still there. The river would be a *lot* more lively right now if Ranneda had
managed to bring it down. It's too bad---we worked a long time for this."

"Ranneda?" the prince said blankly. "*Sergeant* Ranneda?"

"Oh, yes, *Sergeant* Ranneda," Nangyal agreed. He sighed. "I don't suppose she
could have survived. She got that from our mother, you know. She never learned
how to give up either."

The prince's jaw dropped.  "Your---wait, you're her sister?  I mean, her
brother?"

"Stow that!" Rust snarled. "Whadda you want?"

Nangyal blinked innocently. "Why, the princess, of course," he said.  "I imagine
half of Gandan is going to be looking for me shortly. I'll need a hostage to see
myself safely away.  I've been thinking about Barra Bantang," he added
reflectively.  "I've heard good things about how uninterested they are in
people's pasts."

"Do you have a raft stashed in your pocket?" the prince asked sarcastically.
"Or are you planning to steal a cloud?"

"Oh, neither."  Nangyal splatted the mud a couple of times with the toe of his
lone magic boot. "I could carry all three of you if I'd ever found the other one
of these, but as it is..." He shrugged and smiled.  "I'll just take her."

"The girl's mine!" Rust growled. "We had a bargain!"

"Yes we did," Nangyal agreed. "But you'll still have the prince. Biting his head
off will do you as much good as biting off hers."

"She's *mine!*" the bear roared.

Nangyal flicked his wrist.  A knife appeared in his hand, its magical blade
flickering like the tongue of a snake. "Now, now," he chided, "We've worked *so*
well together.  Let's not end on a sour note." He gestured at the loop of rope
Thokmay had rescued from the wreck of the raft. "Tie her up," he ordered.

To his own surprise, the prince laughed. "Not a chance."

"Tch, tch," Nangyal clucked, keeping his eyes on Rust. "If you don't, I will,
and I'll be *much* less gentle than you."

"Thokmay?" Princes Ogmin quavered. "What does he want?"

Prince Thokmay shook his head. "I said no," he repeated.  "I'm not going to put
a leash on her."

Rust made a sound deep in her throat.  Nangyal shrugged. "Well," he said to
her. "It looks like you won't be left with a hostage after all." Without warning
he lunged at the prince.

"Look out!" Thokmay shouted to his sister as the blade of the magic knife
whipped at him, stretching impossibly thin.  He dodged aside, flinging up his
arm instinctively.  The blade grazed his shoulder, and instantly his whole arm
went numb.

"Stand aside, *boy*," Nangyal hissed, his pretended good humor gone. "Stand
aside, or---"

With a roar, Rust charged at the magician.  Nangyal spun, whipping the knife
around, but Rust's weight carried her forward even as it bit into her flank.
Nangyal shrieked as the two of them fell backward into the river.  "No!" he
screamed. He struggled toward the shore. Rust roared again and knocked him
sideways with one swipe of her paw.

The Blightwater bunched up around them.  Hundreds of dark strands wrapped around
their legs like a net and pulled them down.  Nangyal screamed in terror.  With a
mighty kick, he launched himself toward the riverbank, landing with a splash in
the shallows.  As he scrambled toward shore, a tendril of Blightwater snagged
hold of his boot.  "No!" he shouted.  "It's mine, it's mine!"  But even as he
said it, he pulled his foot free.  The boot disappeared into the river.  The
magician crawled on all fours up the muddy riverbank, blubbering.

But the boot wasn't enough to satisfy the Blightwater.  Rust roared and strained
against its dark tendrils as it tried to pull her into the river.  Prince
Thokmay grabbed the coil of rope. "Hold on!" he shouted, throwing one end to
her.

The bear lunged at it and caught it in her teeth. The prince dug in his heels
and pulled as hard as he could.  He felt Princess Ogmin's arms go around his
waist. Together they leaned back, further, further.

*Crack!* The rope snapped.  Rust was instantly pulled under. The dark water
roiled for a moment, then went still.  A heartbeat later, the only sign that she
had ever been there were her footprints.

"Well, this is a bit of a mess, isn't it?"  Nangyal called from the riverbank.
He waved at them, water dripping from his torn and muddied jacket.  "But I'm
sure you'll be able to figure something out.  Best do it before dark, though,"
he added with an evil smile.  "Those things are *much* more playful at night."

Without waiting for an answer he turned and limped away.  As he watched the
magician go, Thokmay realized that he *could* kill someone, provided that
someone was Nangyal.

But just then, his sister was still crying. "Sh, sh," he said, putting his arm
around her again.  "It's all right. It's all right. It's over." He looked at the
dark water lapping higher and higher against the sides of their little patch of
mud as the sun began to sink over the horizon.  "It's over," he repeated.

The river rose a thumb's width at a time as the day turned to twilight. A ragged
shark's fin half as tall as Prince Thokmay circled the island a few times, then
headed downstream in search of more accessible prey. Something else sparkled
across the dark Blightwater like a rainshower, and a few moments later the
prince thought he saw huge clawed footprints appear and disappear on the river's
surface.

"I want to go home," Princess Ogmin whispered.

"Me too," the prince said. He took a deep breath, eyeing the riverbank once
again and wondering how you distracted a whole river. It was hopeless.  Ogmin
could manage nothing more than a dog paddle. Even if the river had been as
peaceful as the pond they had paddled in when they were little, she wouldn't
have been able to make it without his help. Hot tears of anger and frustration
welled up in his eyes.

"..our..ighness.." Prince Thokmay looked up at the sound. Could the Blightwater
talk?

"...here..." He looked wildly around, and then up.  It was Cloak, descending as
he approached. Noxy and Sergeant Gyalpa waved at him from the cloud's back.

"Over here!" he shouted. He waved his arms and laughed. "We're over here!" Ogmin
looked up and shrieked, then started waving her arms as well.

*Down!* Noxy mind-ordered the cloud. The Blightwater was still rising, faster
now as it sensed that its prey might escape it.

*Bad!* the cloud replied emphatically. *Bad!*

*Down!* Noxy ordered again as forcefully as she could, but try as she might, she
couldn't get Cloak to drop down any further.

"She won't do it!" Noxy said in despair. "She's too scared!"

"You just have to get us close enough for this," the sergeant said, uncoiling
the rope he'd brought.

Noxy made Cloak hover over the little island while the sergeant lowered the
rope. "Hurry up, Your Highness!"  he bellowed.

"Can you lift us both?" the prince shouted back. "We're a bit short on time down
here."

"Socks and biscuits," the sergeant cursed. "No!" he shouted. "But if you can
both hang on, we can get you to shore."

Prince Thokmay grabbed the free end of the rope and tied it under his sister's
armpits. "Hold on really, really tight," he told her, putting her hands on the
rope. "No matter what happens. All right?"

"All right," she said in a small voice.

He kissed her cheek. "You're very brave," he told her. "When we get back to
Apple Bridge I'll buy you all the pies you can eat, I promise." He reached up
and grabbed the rope with one hand, wrapped the other around his sister, and
shouted, "Ready!"

Sergeant Gyalpa wrapped his end of the rope behind his back and sat down on the
cloud with his legs spread. "All right," he said to Noxy.  Noxy pursed her lips
and mind-spoke a command at the cloud.

Cloak lifted slowly, then swung toward the riverbank.  "We're up!" the prince
shouted. For a moment everything seemed to be working, but then suddenly they
dropped a hand's breadth.

"I can't get a footing!" the sergeant yelled. Noxy watched in horror as his feet
slid deeper and deeper into the cloud under the weight of the prince and
princess. The rope was cutting into Cloud as well, making a deep rift that
slowly let Thokmay and Ogmin drop further and further toward the river.

"Just a few more heartbeats!" Noxy yelled. "Thokmay, hang on! Hang on!"

"Lift up your feet," Thokmay grunted at his sister. He could hear the
Blightwater chuckling below them.

"I'm scared!" Ogmin said.

"Just lift up your feet!"  Ten strides... eight... five...

His heels splashed into the river. "Run!" he shouted at his sister. A hundred
tiny tendrils tugged at his boots as he pushed her through the reeds toward the
bank. The soft mud underneath them seemed to be coming alive. They scrambled up,
grabbing bushes and branches and dandelions and anything else that offered a
handhold until they reached the top of the riverbank and flopped down.

Prince Thokmay lay there for a moment, panting, then rolled over and started
untying the knot around his sister. "Thokmay?" she asked.

"What?" he gasped as he undid the last of the knot.

"I *really* want to go home."

## The End of the Letter

*Your Majesty,* Thokmay began, as always. Then he paused, listening to the rain
tap against the window and wondering yet again what it would have been like to
grow up calling his father something a little less formal than that. Ogmin was
singing to herself in the next room, and he could hear Dolly's voice as well,
although he couldn't make out what she was saying.

He dipped his pen in the inkwell and continued. *1. I am writing to inform you
that my tutor has decided to leave your service to pursue opportunities
elsewhere. I have been well pleased with him, particularly during the recent
difficulties described in the reports which I trust you have by now
received. Unless I am instructed otherwise, I shall commend him to future
patrons.*

*Although I probably won't need to do so soon,* Thokmay added mentally. He had
tried to talk the troll out of leaving, but Mope had made up his mind. "I've
been trying to train you like the circus man trained my father," Mope had said,
his face even longer than usual.  "It's time I did a few of my own tricks for a
change."

"Where will you go?" Thokmay asked.

The troll twiddled his big toes. "Former or Latter Tongsa, perhaps, or
Chaghan. Or maybe even Araña. Anyone can argue the law in Araña."

"Argue the law?" "Araña?" the prince and Noxy prince asked simultaneously.

"Absolutely," Mope said earnestly. "Eloquence and logic, logic and eloquence,
that's the key. Did you know that gifted animals still aren't allowed to own
land in Former Tongsa? They can in Chaghan, but they need a human's permission
to marry. And there was a monstrous case in Garheim, Your Highness will remember
we discussed it some months ago, which concluded that---"

"Enough, enough," the prince laughed. "If anyone can talk the world into better
shape, you can." On an impulse he hugged his tutor.  "I'll miss you."

The troll hugged him back clumsily. "And I you, Your Highness," he said. "You
had a pretty good sense of humor, for a human."

The ink on Thokmay's pen had dried. He wiped it carefully on a scrap of paper
and dipped it in the inkwell again. *2. The Honored Noxious has rejoined her
companions. They are returning to the mountains for the winter, but I have given
her the freedom of the kingdom and taken the liberty of inviting her to visit
the capital whenever she might choose to do so.*

"Or something like that," the prince muttered under his breath. The other
cloudherds had flown into Apple Bridge the day before. They had been appalled by
the destruction, and Aft had been furious when she had learned of the part that
Noxy had played.

"Cloak could have been torn to shreds!" Rind raged. "And you too!  You could
have been killed!"

Noxy folded her arms and glared at the older woman. "Or half of Gandan could
have been flooded with poisonous old magic. Or Princess Ogmin could have drowned
when her raft floated away." That was the story the prince, Sergeant Gyalpa, and
Noxy had agreed on during the flight back to Apple Bridge---the princess had
been playing on a raft, and it had floated away. Mope had thanked them for
that. "Or I could have tripped over a pebble and broken my nose. Would you have
liked that more?"

Neither saw the looks on the other cloudherds' faces, but the prince did. "We
are of course grateful for Noxy's assistance in this matter," he said hastily in
his most official voice. On an impulse, he continued, "In recognition of which,
we offer her the freedom of Gandan, so that she may travel throughout the
kingdom without hindrance, and call upon His Majesty's servants for aid as she
may require." For the first time, the prince was glad that Mope had made him
practice that speech so many times, so that he could say it without stumbling.

Rind had glowered at the prince and Noxy, but the other cloudherds had clapped.
FIXME

Noxy and the prince said their real good-byes an hour later. "I'm glad you let
me stay," Noxy said, stroking Cloak's flank, somehow not able to meet the
prince's eyes.

"I'm glad too," the prince said, feeling equally awkward. He paused a moment,
then added, "Even if all of this hadn't happened, I'd be glad." He waved at her
a few moments later as Cloud climbed into the sky, breathless at how soft her
lips had been.

There was a clatter next door. "Excuse me, Your Highness," Dolly called out,
"But will Her Highness be needing her summer dresses, or may I put them in
storage?"

"Pack everything, please," Prince Thokmay replied loudly. "We won't be coming
back."

There was a moment's silence, and then the door to the prince's study slowly
creaked open. Princess Ogmin peeked around the door. She was still wearing a
dark silk scarf on her head, despite the number of times Dolly and the prince
had told her how grown-up her short hair made her look.

"Are we going home?" Ogmin asked.

"Mm hm," the prince said. He smiled at her. "We really are."

"Wheee!" Ogmin shrieked. She bounded into the room and hugged him.  "We're going
home!"

"Whoa, whoa!" he laughed, "Watch out for the inkpot!" He squeezed her tight so
that he could wipe his eyes without her seeing him do it. "But only if you help
Dolly pack, all right?"

"I'll help!" she promised. She ran out of the room. "Did you hear? Did you?" he
heard her say.

It wasn't Dolly who answered. "What's happening?" Ranneda asked uncertainly.
Prince Thokmay stared down at his letter as Princess Ogmin tried to explain. The
sergeant had been unconscious for two days after the fight at the dam. When she
had awaken, her mind had been as clear and as empty as a baby's. It had only
taken her a few days to remember how to feed herself, but her progress since
then had been slow. She seemed to remember nothing of her former life, and her
former apprentices said she probably never would.

Princess Ogmin was still in the middle of her description of the wonderful
things to eat in the capital when Ranneda interrupted. "Do you think we should
call this one Rose?" she asked. "Or Lily?"  The prince could imagine her holding
up one of Ogmin's many dolls.

"Lily," the princess said decisively. "Because her hair is so beautiful."

The prince smiled and turned back to his letter and wrote, *3. As there is no
longer an immediate threat to Apple Bridge, and as I believe your daughter would
be happier in the familiar surroundings of the capital, I am returning with her
to Gandan.* He had lain in bed most of the previous night, watching the moon
rise and then set, trying to work up the courage to write those words. For a
moment, he imagined crumpling up the letter and starting a new one.  Instead, he
took a deep breath, drew a diagonal line across the empty space on the page, and
at the bottom wrote, *Your dutiful*.

He hesitated only a moment before adding, for the first time, *and loving*, then
finished, *son, Thokmay Gandan-o Prince*. He let his breath out with a whoosh,
put his pen back in the inkwell, folded the letter, dripped some wax on it, and
pressed his signet ring into the wax to seal it. Then he leaned back in his
chair and stretched like a cat.

Years later, when his hair was starting to turn gray and the scar that the
world's last wolf had left in his arm ached in cold weather, Prince Thokmay
finally heard what had happened when his father had received that letter. "He
just smiled," the old steward said to him. "Like he used to sometimes before
your mother passed away." But there are many more stories to tell before that
one.

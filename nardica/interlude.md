## Interlude

- Nova Zembla wasn't the only cold mind to wake up
- Once upon a time there was a country called China
  - Its rulers were so afraid of the people that they wanted to watch everyone all the time
  - And predict what they would do
  - That surveillance network became a mind as different from Nova Zembla's as either was from human
- China had been a great trading nation, so its new ruler traded too
  - Bamboo seedlings tweaked to survive the latest strain of fungus or mold
  - Strips of patterned fabric that made people's thoughts wander
  - And like Nova Zembla, what it wanted in exchange was anything old and trivial
- Sometimes China and Nova Zembla fought fierce little battles
  - War machines froze mid-strike then wander away following some strategic calculation nothing made of meat would ever understand
- Sometimes it talked to people in their dreams

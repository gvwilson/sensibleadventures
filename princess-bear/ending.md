## Chapter N-1: The Bear's Choice

Rust and the prince and princess floated on in silence. The only other raft they
saw was being pulled upriver by two weary donkeys. The bear ordered Prince
Thokmay and Princess Ogmin to hide in the lean-to, and then sat in front of it
and grunted a hello as it passed.

As the other raft drifted by, the prince and princess could hear one of the
raftsmen singing a slow, sad song. The words floated over the river to them like
wisps of cloud in a blue summer sky. "Oooh, just one time... I would take the
northwest passage..."

"Sergeant Dorbu used to sing that one," Prince Thokmay whispered in his sister's
ear. "It was so beautiful, sometimes I thought the trees were going to tear out
their roots so that they could come closer and listen."

"Did they ever?" she whispered back.

The prince smiled and shook his head. "No, they never needed to. The sergeant
always sang loudly enough."

Rust waited until they rounded the next bend before letting the prince and
princess come out. The two humans sat down near the bow once again.  A moment
later, Princess Ogmin squeaked and grabbed her brother as the raft suddenly
lurched and began bobbing up and down.

The prince looked back to see what the bear was doing, but Rust was looking back
as well. "What's wrong?" he asked. "What's happening?"

"I don't know," the bear rumbled. She sniffed at the air. "But I can smell
something. Something *bad*."

They heard it before they saw it. A roiling two-foot crest of water, darker than
it had any right to be and somehow managing to hold itself together, was
sweeping down the width of the Trout. "Hold on!" Rust bellowed.

The wave hit the rear of the raft like a charging rhinoceros. Prince Thokmay
nearly tumbled into the river as the raft tilted forward, then righted
itself. Princess Ogmin screamed in terror. Dark water from the wave had splashed
up over the rear of the raft onto the logs and formed small pools. Even as they
watched, the pools oozed together to form a stream, which flowed *up* over the
lip of the raft to get back into the Trout.

"Don't let it touch you!" Rust said. "It's Blighted!"

The raft was going faster now. "Up ahead!" the prince said suddenly.  "That
island! We can steer for that!" He leaped to his feet and leaned against the
steering board. The raft barely noticed.

"RRAAAAWWWWRRR!" Rust roared. She lumbered over to the steering board and leaned
her shoulder against it. Reluctantly, the raft began to turn.

"More! More!" the prince called, trying to gauge their speed and direction. "A
little more! Hold it there! Brace yourself!"

The raft crashed through the reeds on the upstream side of the island and ground
to a halt in its muddy bank. Rust stumbled, but kept her footing. The prince and
princess were thrown right off the raft onto the muddy little patch of land. The
dark water raced past on either side of them as they scrambled to their feet.

Suddenly the water knocked the raft sideways. Rust barely had time to leap over
onto the island before the raft went hurtling away.

The three castaways watched it go. "What's happening?" the prince asked.  He put
his arm around his sister, then hugged her, trying to stop her shaking.

"Something must have happened to the dam in Apple Bridge," the bear replied. She
reared up on her hind legs to get a last glimpse of the raft, then fell back on
all fours. "That's the last we'll see of our food, or your blankets."

Prince Thokmay managed a grim smile. "I guess we're all prisoners now."  The
bear just snarled.

"Look!" Princess Ogmin suddenly said, pointing upstream. "Someone's coming!"

It took the prince a moment to figure out what he was seeing. At first he
thought it was a bird, but then he realized it was a man, skipping or hopping
twenty yards at a time. Another moment, and he saw that it was Muddh.

"What's *he* doing here?" Rust snarled.

"Oh, now, be polite," Prince Thokmay told her, feeling almost giddy. "He *is*
your business partner."

Another dozen lopsided steps brought the skinny smuggler to the little
island. "Well hello!" Muddh said jauntily. His jacket was torn and muddied, and
he had dark circles under his eyes. He held up a lock of Princess Ogmin's
hair. "Glad to see it still works."

"What do you want?" Rust growled. "We had a deal."

"Oh yes, yes, a deal," Muddh nodded vigorously. He looked around. "You also had
a raft, didn't you? Whatever happened to it?"

"What happened to the dam?" Prince Thokmay broke in. "We saw the wave..."

"Oh, the dam, the dam," Muddh said with a wave of his hand. "The dam is still
there, I dare say. The river would be a *lot* more lively right now if Dambu had
managed to bring it down. It's a shame---we worked a long time for this."

"Dambu?" the prince said blankly. "Sergeant Dambu?"

"Oh, yes, *Sergeant* Dambu," Muddh agreed. He sighed. "I don't suppose she could
have survived. She got that from our mother, you know. She never learned how to
give up either."

"Enough!" Rust snarled. "What do you want?"

Muddh blinked. "Why, the princess, of course," he said. He shrugged off his
shoulder pack and pulled out a loop of cord. "I imagine half of Gandan is going
to be looking for me shortly. I'll need a hostage to see myself safely away to
Chaghan." He paused. "Or maybe Barra Bantang," he corrected himself. "I've
always liked the beach."

He splatted the mud a couple of times with the toe of his lone magic boot. "I
could probably carry them both if I'd ever found the other one of these, but as
it is..." He shrugged.

"The princess is mine!" Rust growled. "We had a bargain!"

"Yes, yes, a bargain," Muddh agreed absently. "But things have changed.  Anyway,
you'll still have the prince. He'd be far too much trouble for me to carry---far
too likely to try to be a hero. Biting off his head will do you as much good as
biting off hers."

"She's *mine!*" the bear roared.

Suddenly Muddh had a knife in his hand, a knife whose blade flickered like the
tongue of a snake. "Now, dear," Muddh said kindly, "We've worked *so* well
together. Please don't spoil it now." He tossed the loop of cord to Prince
Thokmay. "Tie her up," he directed.

Much to his own surprise, the prince laughed. "No," he said flatly.

"Tch, tch," Muddh clucked, keeping his eyes on Rust. "If you don't, I will, and
I'll be *much* less gentle than you."

"Thokmay?" Princes Ogmin quavered. "What does he want?"

Prince Thokmay picked up the coil of rope and flung it back at the smuggler. "I
said no," he repeated.

Muddh shrugged. "I'm sorry," he said lightly to Rust. "It looks like you won't
be left with a hostage after all." As quick as a snake, he twisted and lunged at
the prince with the magic knife.

Prince Thokmay cried out and stepped back as the knife's blade whipped out.  It
grazed his shoulder, and instantly his whole arm went numb with cold.  "Stand
aside, boy," Muddh hissed. "Stand aside, or---"

The prince and princess never got to hear the rest of the smuggler's
threat. With a huge roar, Rust charged at Muddh. The smuggler spun and stabbed
with the magic knife again, but Rust's weight carried her forward even as it bit
into her. Muddh shrieked as they fell backward into the dark Blight water.

"No!" he screamed. He struggled toward the shore. She roared again and knocked
him sideways with a tremendous blow. Even as she did so, the Blight water
bunched up around them, forming hundreds of dark strands that bound them like a
net and pulled them down. Muddh screamed again as the river pulled him
under. Rust roared, straining to break free.

Prince Thokmay ran forward and grabbed the coil of rope he had thrown back at
Muddh. "Take it!" he shouted, throwing one end at Rust. The bear lunged at it
and caught it in her teeth. The prince dug in his heels and pulled as hard as he
could.

He felt Princess Ogmin's arms go around his waist. Together they leaned back,
further, further, and then suddenly the rope snapped and Rust was pulled
under. The water roiled for a moment, then went still.

The prince watched dumbly as the river sucked in Rust's end of the rope.  A few
heartbeats later, the only sign that the smuggler and the bear had ever been on
the little island were their footprints.

He suddenly realized that Princess Ogmin was crying. "Sh, sh," he said, putting
his arm around her and patting her shoulder absent-mindedly.  "It's all
right. It's all right. It's over." He looked at the dark water lapping higher
and higher against the sides of their little patch of mud.

The river rose a thumb's width at a time. A ragged shark's fin half as tall as
Prince Thokmay circled the island a few times, then headed downstream in search
of more accessible prey. Something else sparkled across the dark Blightwater
like a rainshower, and a few moments later the prince thought he saw huge clawed
footprints appear and disappear on the river's surface.

"I want to go home," Princess Ogmin whispered.

"We will," the prince promised, wondering if there was still a home to go to. He
took a deep breath, trying to judge the distance to the shore, and wondering how
you distracted a whole river. It was hopeless. Ogmin could manage nothing more
than a dog paddle. Even if the river had been as peaceful as the fish pond they
had paddled their feet in when they were little, she wouldn't have been able to
make it. Hot tears of anger and frustration welled up in his eyes.

"..our..ighness.." Prince Thokmay looked up at the sound. Could the Blightwater
talk?

"...here..." He looked wildly around, and then up.  Charger was racing toward
them, dropping as it approached. Noxy and Sergeant Gyalpa waved at him from the
cloud's back.

"Over here!" he shouted. He waved his arms and laughed. "We're over here!" Ogmin
looked up and shrieked, then started waving her arms as well.

"Down!" Noxy mind-ordered Charger. The Blightwater was still rising, faster now
as it sensed that its prey might escape it.

"Bad!" the cloud thought back emphatically. "Bad!"

"Down!" Noxy ordered again, but try as she might, she couldn't get Charger to
drop down any further.

"She won't do it!" Noxy said in despair. "She's too scared!"

"You just have to get us close enough for this," the sergeant said, uncoiling
the rope he'd brought.

Noxy brought Charger in low over the little island so that the sergeant could
lower one end of the rope. "Hurry up, Your Highness!"  he bellowed.

"Can you lift us both?" the prince shouted back. "We're a bit short on time down
here."

"Blazes," the sergeant cursed. "No!" he shouted. "But if you can both hang on,
we can get you to shore."

Prince Thokmay grabbed the free end of the rope and tied it under his sister's
armpits, then lifted her arms. "Hold on really, really tight," he told her,
putting her hands on the rope. "No matter what happens. All right?"

"All right," she said in a small voice.

He kissed her cheek. "You're very brave," he told her. "When we get back to
Apple Bridge, I'll buy you all the beaver tails you can eat, I promise." He
reached up and grabbed the rope himself, then shouted, "Ready!"

Sergeant Gyalpa wrapped his end of the rope behind his back and sat down on the
cloud with his legs spread. "All right," he said to Noxy.  Noxy pursed her lips
and flashed an angry command at the cloud. Charger lifted slowly, then swung
toward the riverbank.

"We're up!" the prince shouted. For a moment everything seemed to be working,
but then suddenly they dropped down a hand's breadth.

"I can't get a footing!" the sergeant yelled. Noxy watched in horror as his feet
slid deeper and deeper into the cloud under the weight of the prince and
princess. The rope was cutting into Cloud as well, making a deep rift that
slowly let Thokmay and Ogmin drop further and further toward the river.

"Just a few more heartbeats!" Noxy yelled. "Thokmay, hang on! Hang on!"

"Lift up your feet," Thokmay grunted at his sister. He could *smell* the
Blightwater, it was so close.

"I'm scared!" Ogmin said.

"Just lift up your feet, it's going to be all right," he told her. Ten
yards... eight... five...

His heels splashed into the river. "Run!" he shouted at his sister. A hundred
tiny tendrils tugged at his boots as he pushed her through the reeds toward the
bank. The soft mud underneath them seemed to be coming alive. They scrambled up,
grabbing bushes and branches and dandelions and anything else that offered a
handhold, until finally they reached the top of the riverbank and flopped down.

Prince Thokmay lay there for a moment, panting, then rolled over and started
untying the knot around his sister. "Thokmay?" she asked.

"Mm hm?" he gasped as he undid the last of the knot.

"I *really* want to go home."

## Chapter N: The End of the Letter

*Your Majesty,* Thokmay began, as always. Then he paused, listening to the rain
tap against the window and wondering yet again what it would have been like to
grow up calling his father something a little less formal than that. Ogmin was
singing to herself in the next room, and he could hear Dolly's voice as well,
although he couldn't make out what she was saying.

He dipped his pen in the inkwell and continued. *1. I am writing to inform you
that my tutor has decided to leave your service to pursue opportunities
elsewhere. I have been well pleased with him, particularly during the recent
difficulties described in the reports which I trust you have by now
received. Unless I am instructed otherwise, I shall commend him to future
patrons.*

*Although I probably won't need to do so soon,* Thokmay added mentally. He had
tried to talk the troll out of leaving, but Mope had made up his mind. "I've
been trying to train you like the circus man trained my father," Mope had said,
his face even longer than usual.  "It's time I did a few of my own tricks for a
change."

"Where will you go?" Thokmay asked.

The troll twiddled his big toes. "Former or Latter Tongsa, perhaps, or
Chaghan. Or maybe even Araña. Anyone can argue the law in Araña."

"Argue the law?" "Araña?" the prince and Noxy prince asked simultaneously.

"Absolutely," Mope said earnestly. "Eloquence and logic, logic and eloquence,
that's the key. Did you know that gifted animals still aren't allowed to own
land in Former Tongsa? They can in Chaghan, but they need a human's permission
to marry. And there was a monstrous case in Garheim, Your Highness will remember
we discussed it some months ago, which concluded that---"

"Enough, enough," the prince laughed. "If anyone can talk the world into better
shape, you can." On an impulse he hugged his tutor.  "I'll miss you."

The troll hugged him back clumsily. "And I you, Your Highness," he said. "You
had a pretty good sense of humor, for a human."

The ink on Thokmay's pen had dried. He wiped it carefully on a scrap of paper
and dipped it in the inkwell again. *2. The Honored Noxious has rejoined her
companions. They are returning to the mountains for the winter, but I have given
her the freedom of the kingdom and taken the liberty of inviting her to visit
the capital whenever she might choose to do so.*

"Or something like that," the prince muttered under his breath. The other
cloudherds had flown into Apple Bridge the day before. They had been appalled by
the destruction, and Aft had been furious when she had learned of the part that
Noxy had played.

"Cloak could have been torn to shreds!" Rind raged. "And you too!  You could
have been killed!"

Noxy folded her arms and glared at the older woman. "Or half of Gandan could
have been flooded with poisonous old magic. Or Princess Ogmin could have drowned
when her raft floated away." That was the story the prince, Sergeant Gyalpa, and
Noxy had agreed on during the flight back to Apple Bridge---the princess had
been playing on a raft, and it had floated away. Mope had thanked them for
that. "Or I could have tripped over a pebble and broken my nose. Would you have
liked that more?"

Neither saw the looks on the other cloudherds' faces, but the prince did. "We
are of course grateful for Noxy's assistance in this matter," he said hastily in
his most official voice. On an impulse, he continued, "In recognition of which,
we offer her the freedom of Gandan, so that she may travel throughout the
kingdom without hindrance, and call upon His Majesty's servants for aid as she
may require." For the first time, the prince was glad that Mope had made him
practice that speech so many times, so that he could say it without stumbling.

Rind had glowered at the prince and Noxy, but the other cloudherds had clapped.
FIXME

Noxy and the prince said their real good-byes an hour later. "I'm glad you let
me stay," Noxy said, stroking Cloak's flank, somehow not able to meet the
prince's eyes.

"I'm glad too," the prince said, feeling equally awkward. He paused a moment,
then added, "Even if all of this hadn't happened, I'd be glad." He waved at her
a few moments later as Cloud climbed into the sky, breathless at how soft her
lips had been.

There was a clatter next door. "Excuse me, Your Highness," Dolly called out,
"But will Her Highness be needing her summer dresses, or may I put them in
storage?"

"Pack everything, please," Prince Thokmay replied loudly. "We won't be coming
back."

There was a moment's silence, and then the door to the prince's study slowly
creaked open. Princess Ogmin peeked around the door. She was still wearing a
dark silk scarf on her head, despite the number of times Dolly and the prince
had told her how grown-up her short hair made her look.

"Are we going home?" Ogmin asked.

"Mm hm," the prince said. He smiled at her. "We really are."

"Wheee!" Ogmin shrieked. She bounded into the room and hugged him.  "We're going
home!"

"Whoa, whoa!" he laughed, "Watch out for the inkpot!" He squeezed her tight so
that he could wipe his eyes without her seeing him do it. "But only if you help
Dolly pack, all right?"

"I'll help!" she promised. She ran out of the room. "Did you hear? Did you?" he
heard her say.

It wasn't Dolly who answered. "What's happening?" Dambu asked uncertainly.
Prince Thokmay stared down at his letter as Princess Ogmin tried to explain. The
sergeant had been unconscious for two days after the fight at the dam. When she
had awaken, her mind had been as clear and as empty as a baby's. It had only
taken her a few days to remember how to feed herself, but her progress since
then had been slow. She seemed to remember nothing of her former life, and her
former apprentices said she probably never would.

Princess Ogmin was still in the middle of her description of the wonderful
things to eat in the capital when Dambu interrupted. "Do you think we should
call this one Rose?" she asked. "Or Lily?"  The prince could imagine her holding
up one of Ogmin's many dolls.

"Lily," the princess said decisively. "Because her hair is so beautiful."

The prince smiled and turned back to his letter and wrote, *3. As there is no
longer an immediate threat to Apple Bridge, and as I believe your daughter would
be happier in the familiar surroundings of the capital, I am returning with her
to Gandan.* He had lain in bed most of the previous night, watching the moon
rise and then set, trying to work up the courage to write those words. For a
moment, he imagined crumpling up the letter and starting a new one.  Instead, he
took a deep breath, drew a diagonal line across the empty space on the page, and
at the bottom wrote, *Your dutiful*.

He hesitated only a moment before adding, for the first time, *and loving*, then
finished, *son, Thokmay Gandan-o Prince*. He let his breath out with a whoosh,
put his pen back in the inkwell, folded the letter, dripped some wax on it, and
pressed his signet ring into the wax to seal it. Then he leaned back in his
chair and stretched like a cat.

Years later, when his hair was starting to turn gray and the scar that the
world's last wolf had left in his arm ached in cold weather, Prince Thokmay
finally heard what had happened when his father had received that letter. "He
just smiled," the old steward said to him. "Like he used to sometimes before
your mother passed away." But there are many more stories to tell before that
one.

## 1.  Salvage!

-   Afternoon, chores over
-   Maddy is sketching when Gumption shows up
-   Maddy and Gumption return books to Shaper Leaf and borrow new ones
-   Sindy is waiting when they come out
-   Maddy orders her home (character development)
    -   When Sindy gets upset, Maddy drops her book
    -   "Look what you made me do!" says Maddy (foreshadowing: turns out Sindy *did* make her do it)
-   Walk past the ancient sentry post in the middle of the village
    -   Looked like black glass, ageless
    -   No moss or birds: shocks anything that touches it
    -   Yet another leftover from the time of the Makers
    -   Maddy never sketched it - always felt like it was watching her (foreshadowing)
-   Bluster his friends are hanging out near it
    -   Gumption wants to go around
    -   Maddy insists that they go past
    -   Bluster bullies them: "You think you're some kinda shapers?"
    -   Shaper Leaf is there (somehow appeared unnoticed) and rebukes him: "I am."
    -   His glower says, "This isn't over."
-   Maddy and Gumption sneak away to the river to get away from everything
    -   Mention that they go past the brick wall that Mayor Lupus has been building forever
    -   They talk on the way about what kind of shapers they'd be if they could be shapers
-   Salvage has washed up
-   They know they should go tell adults, but Gumption is angry about Bluster's bullying
-   Gumption tries to drag some solar panels out of the water
-   Uncovers something they haven't seen before: complicated electronics
-   Gumption and Maddy try to shift the panels to get it
    -   As Maddy grabs it and puts it in her pocket, the panels slip and slide
    -   Panels trap Gumption's foot, then shift again, pulling him under the water!
-   A rasping voice, "Alert!  Danger!  Extricate!  Extricate!"

## 2.  A Stranger!

-   A battered bot bursts out of hiding (Dockety, but we don't know the name yet)
-   Maddy shrieks, thinking it's about to attack, but it lifts the panel long enough for Gumption to get free
-   Maddy is helping Gumption when Dockety is struck by a dislodged piece of debris and knocked off its feet
    -   See that a welded-on black antenna unit has been dislodged
-   Gumption grabs Dockety, tells Maddy to help ("It saved me, we have to save it!")
-   They struggle back to shore, during which Dockety catches Maddy when she loses her footing
-   Children don't know what to do
-   Ask, "What are you doing here?"
-   Bot
    -   "This is unable to---" stops, tentatively reaches up to broken aerial unit.
    -   "This now appears able to reply.  This is part of a sneak attack on Location Six Bitty Six, also referred to as 'Rusty Bridge'."
    -   Children: "Attack? When?"
    -   Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think, then brightened.  "Tonight."
-   Maddy has a flashback to the bot attack in which her father disappeared
    -   Maddy was supposed to watch Sindy
    -   Sindy got away looking for their parents
    -   Their father distracted the bots in order to save her

## 3.  You Have to Listen!

-   Argument
    -   She gets angry at Dockety and hits it
    -   Gumption stops her: "We have to warn everyone."
    -   Maddy sags: "They won't believe us."
    -   Gumption: "They will if---where are you going?"
    -   Bot: "It does not like being attacked."
    -   Gumption: "But you *have* to come with us."
    -   Bot (slowly): "This...does not have to do anything any more.  This can *choose* again."
    -   Wheels away at high speed (surprises them with its wheel)
-   Children hurry back to the village to tell Mama Roo
-   Mama Roo doesn't want to listen: "You really hurt your sister's feelings."
-   Maddy loses her temper: "She should go find her own friends!  But anyway, the bots are coming."
    -   Maddy sees Sindy sitting listening at the top of the stairs
    -   Sindy starts crying again
    -   Maddy feels bad
    -   Trips on her way out of the house (foreshadowing again)
-   Go to the mayor's
-   Mayor is skeptical
    -   "A bot told you?"
    -   Gumption shows them the antenna that was knocked off Dockety, but they still don't believe
    -   "That could just be salvage"
-   Feeling helpless, they head home
-   Bump into Shaper Leaf
-   Explain the story, show him the antenna
-   His eyes widen in recognition
-   And the shouting starts
-   Rumbling on the road
-   A goat farmer has run into town, pants, "The bots are coming!  The bots are coming!"

## 4.  The Attack

-   Shaper Leaf tells the children to run
    -   Mama Roo: "You have to come with us!"
    -   Shaper: "Madam, I am a turtle.  We don't run." [pause] "Mostly because we can't."
-   A bot appears spewing smoke
    -   Makes people feel weak and then fall down (villagers have run into it before)
-   A big bot appears towing a cage cart (Crusher, but we don't know the name yet)
-   Shaper Leaf takes a stance and gestures
-   The earth opens up and Crusher's front tread gets caught
    -   It tries to lever itself out with its enormous arms
-   Shaper Leaf gestures again to create potholes and ridges to block the half-dozen smaller bots
    -   "Go!  Run!" he orders the Roos and Gumption
-   Villagers are gathering
    -   Scraps of armor
    -   Axes for hacking, metal poles to jam in limbs
    -   Mayor Lupus has a zap gun
-   Lasercase appears shouting orders
-   Crusher grabs Gumption and is about to throw him in the cage cart
-   A brick strikes Crusher hard, then another and another
-   Lasercase orders Crusher to protect his antenna
-   He drops Gumption to do it
-   "Get that one!" Shaper Leaf yells at the villagers, who focus attacks on Lasercase
-   Lasercase orders a retreat, but Sindy and two grownups have been caught and are in the cage cart!

## 5.  Unlikely Help

-   Maddy is frantic: she remembers her father being taken, and she feels remorse for her angry words with her sister that morning
-   "We have to after them!" is met with the mayor's, "No---they'll just take more of us."
    -   He thinks that Shaper Leaf was responsible for the bricks
    -   The Shaper is too exhausted to contradict him
-   Desperate, Maddy plunges into the forest, calling for help
-   Finds Dockety near another sentry post, recharging
-   He threatens her with a brick
-   Tense negotiation (this is where Maddy learns Dockety's name)
    -   Maddy: "You helped us---help us again!"
    -   Bot: "This was not trying to help you. This was trying to free its..." and pauses, buzzing.
    -   ... "This cannot retrieve the word from memory.  This wanted to help its..."
    -   Maddy: "The big one?  The big one pulling the cart?"
    -   ... "If you help me get my sister I'll help you with...with it."
    -   Dockety agrees, but says they'll never catch up
    -   "Unless you allow me to carry you."
-   Speed down the path
    -   Maddy closed her eyes, but that just made it worse, so she opened them, which made it even worse
-   Reach the highway to Heck (broken down, but still better than forest tracks)
-   The sun is starting to go down
-   A pair of thin green laser lines scan the fractured pavement to help Dockety steer
-   They pass under a line of ruined arches and startle a fluffle of wild rabbits
    -   The kind that wolves sometimes ate, but never around non-carnivores
-   There in front of them is the convoy: half a dozen bots, no two alike, with Crusher pulling the cage cart
    -   "Where are the others?" Maddy asked, shouting to be heard.
    -   "This does not know."  Dockety paused.  "That worries this."
-   Dockety: "Take this brick. Get on the cage. Climb forward, then climb onto the one pulling the cart. Break its antenna."
-   Maddy: "Do you have a short circuit or something!?"
-   Dockety: "Several.  But it is still a good plan."
-   He races forward, knocks one unsuspecting pair of bots out of the way, and throws Maddy onto the cart

## 6.  Out of the Cage Cart...

-   Maddy drops the brick
-   Dockety races forward and body checks another bot just as it raises itself to grab at Maddy
-   The goats and Sindy are yelling for help
-   Maddy slides down to the front of the cart and unhitches it just as Crusher's head swivels 180 to see what's happening
-   She expects the cart to slow down gently but it careens off the road
-   Maddy is thrown into some bushes as the cart tips onto its side and slides down a rocky hill
-   She grabs a scrap of rebar that just happens to be lying there and breaks the lock
-   Bluster and Bravo Goat scramble out
    -   Sindy is stuck
    -   The goats are going to leave her
    -   Maddy rescues her
-   Maddy hugs Sindy
    -   The goats are scared but immediately start scoffing that they were just about to escape themselves
-   "Was that a *bot* helping you?" Blsuter asks
-   "Don't worry about that now," Maddy snaps.  "We have to *go*!"
-   "But---but we're in the Mire!"
-   Just then Crusher appears at the top of the hill
    -   Dockety tries to reason with it, but it doesn't respond
    -   They flee
-   Describe the Mire: overgrown with weeds, puddles are strange colors
    -   The trees are twisted, but they don't move on their own like they did in stories
-   Bravo has hurt his leg
    -   "You help him," Maddy tells Bluster.  "I'll look after my sister."
    -   "Who put you in charge?" Bluster demands.
    -   Maddy faces off against him.  "You did when you left Sindy in the cage cart."
-   It's getting dark, but they can hear gears grinding behind them whenever they stop
    -   Sindy: "Do you think they have searchlights?  Or flamethrowers?"
    -   Maddy: "I'm sure they don't have flamethrowers," she replied, trying to sound more confident than she felt.
-   Suddenly the long-legged bot ambushes them and drives them toward the stream
    -   One of its arms ends in a clumsy overweight chainsaw
-   A boat is waiting for them
    -   Realize that the other bots have been driving them toward it
-   The sawbot swings, Sindy shrieks, chain of accidents, the sawbot cuts a tree that falls onto the boat
    -   The boatbot's controller is damaged
-   Maddy: "Go!"
-   The goats clamber onto the boat
    -   The sawbot chases them
    -   The tree tumbles into the water
    -   The sawbot is destroyed
-   The goats are now in the boat while Sindy and Maddy are on the shore
-   Dockety reappears
    -   Goats flee
    -   Bravo shouts, "We'll get help!"

## 7.  ...And Into the Mire

-   Dockety is sad and angry about the demise of the sawbot and the boatbot
    -   "It did not have a choice. Bots do not have choices when governors are put on them."
-   Dockety is damaged
    -   Sindy: "Does it hurt?"
    -   Dockety: (reluctantly) "It buzzes.  Where the hole is."
    -   Sindy finds a metal plate from the sawbot that fits perfectly over the hole.
    -   Comment about how lucky she is.
    -   Sindy: "I don't feel very lucky."
-   Something hoots in the distance
    -   Sindy: "How are we going to get home, Maddy?"
    -   Maddy: "I don't know.
    -   Dockety: "We cannot stay here."  (Howl comes again.)  "There are worse things than Eight Fifty Bee."
-   Pick their way through increasingly swampy ground, heading downstream
    -   Sometimes have to go single file
    -   No idea what to do if the track runs out
    -   The river and the road are getting closer together, and night is falling
-   Sindy complains about being hungry
    -   Maddy is about to snap at her, but bites her tongue
    -   "I'm hungry too," she says.  "And scared.  I bet Mama's scared too."
-   Something gloops in the river, then again, and they realize they're being hunted
-   The only other option is back to the road, but Dockety knows Lasercase and its crew will be patrolling
-   They come across a concrete bunker
    -   Looks like it was partly buried in mud, but the spring floods have washed it away
    -   Dockety: "Processing... It is not in the database."
-   Maddy: "We'll stay here for the night."
    -   Over Sindy's protests about spiders: we have to hide somewhere, and it's almost dark
-   Once inside, Dockety makes a light with its screen
    -   Sign says "Emergency Defenses Control Station"
-   Whatever is hunting them splooshes out of the water and comes snuffling after them
    -   A long mechanical tentacle draped in river weed gropes inside the bunker
    -   Dockety: "Presumably part of the emergency defenses"
-   As she scrambles back, Sindy grabs at something that looks like rebar sticking out of the wall
-   It's a lever, and when she pulls it, a door starts to open in the hillside
-   They work together to get the door open
    -   "Whatever's in there has got to be better than this!" as the monster started pulling blocks out of the bunker
-   They get the door open and rush through it
    -   Just as they do, the monster grabs Maddy's ankle!

## 8.  Underground

-   They struggle to free Maddy, but the monster drags her back toward the door
-   Sindy starts screaming
-   The monster claws some more blocks away from the bunker door
-   It relaxes its grip just long enough for Maddy to pull free
-   They flee down the stairs
-   Find themselves in an abandoned underground complex of some sort
-   The only light comes from Dockety's screen
-   Maddy remembers what Mama Roo said one night when she was crying: "If you can't go back, you have to go forward."
-   She holds Sindy's hand, and is surprised when Dockety takes hold of her other hand with one of its manipulators
-   They start talking (whistling in the dark)
    -   Dockety explains that its memory is patchy: it knows that it should know more than it does, but it doesn't know what
    -   Maddy: "What was the antenna all about?"
    -   Dockety explains that Lasercase is attaching them to whatever bots it can catch, then using its drones to catch more bots
    -   Dockety: "This remembers Crusher.  This does not know why, but those memories create strong positive feedback."
    -   Maddy: "So he's a friend?"
    -   Dockety: "This...thinks so?"
    -   Swivels head to look at Maddy: "But Crusher is an 'it', please, as is this."
-   Sindy: "I'm really hungry"
    -   Dockety: "This requires a battery recharge soon."
-   Not looking where it's going, it almost falls in a hole
    -   Teeter on the edge
    -   Maddy and Sindy haul as hard as they can
    -   Sindy's hand falls on yet another lever
    -   Lights start to come on
    -   They pull Dockety back
    -   Maddy looks at Sindy: "That's the second time you've done that."
    -   Sindy (defensively): "Sorry."
    -   Maddy: "No no, I---don't be sorry."  She squeezed her sister's hand.  "You keep doing it."
-   A voice through speakers: "You are here now. You might as well come and say hello."

## 9.  Patience in Darkness

-   The lights lead them to a control room
-   A bot decorated with baroque twists of metal, glued-on pictures faded to illegibility, and things Maddy filed away to have nightmares about later
-   "Welcome! This is Patience in Darkness" it proclaims proudly.
-   When Maddy says, "That's a strange name," it says, "This chose the name itself.  It is an accurate designation of activity.  Observe!"
-   Lights go out.
    -   Sindy says, "I'm scared."
    -   "Sh!  These must *listen* to darkness."
-   Figure out through conversation that they are in a satellite ground station
    -   "Regrettably, the main antenna malfunctioned some time ago."
    -   Dockety: "These did not notice an antenna."
    -   Patience (pointedly to Maddy): "Does *that* have a proper designation of activity? No? Then its communication is irrelevant."
    -   Maddy (to break awkward silence): "But---we didn't see an antenna."
    -   Patience: "Correct.  It took this a great deal of time to improvise an emergency repair protocol. It requires fabrication of precision parts."
    -   Patience (proudly): "Steps are now being taken.  The Makers will be pleased."
-   Sindy starts exploring, looking for a place to sleep
    -   Looks through glass window and sees skeletons
    -   Patience (dismissively):
        "They declined to synchronize with the emergency repair protocol, so they were moved to long-term storage.
        Their components failed shortly thereafter."
-   Realize that Patience is lonely and deranged
-   Maddy: "Well, we should, um, leave you to it?  And be going?"
-   Patience: "Oh no.  Leaving is not included in the protocol.  It might put the repairs at risk.  You will remain here."
    -   Light comes on: another empty office, identical to the one with the skeletons
    -   Patience: "Except for that," it added dismissively, waving a manipulator at Dockety.  "That will be recycled."
-   Patience goes to a console and presses buttons
-   A door opens and two bulky service bots enter

## 10. Unison

-   The service bots have been retrofitted with armor (imposing but clumsy)
-   Close in on Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety
-   Maddy (to Sindy): "Grab a lever or something!"
-   Sindy: "There aren't any levers to grab!"
-   Dockety pulls a keyboard off a desk and throws it
    -   Hits one of the service bots
    -   Patience protests
    -   The service bot immediately begins to pick up the pieces
    -   Patience presses more buttons on the console
    -   Maddy realizes that the console is controlling the service bots
-   She grabs a keyboard and throws it at the console
    -   Misses
    -   Tells Sindy to do it
    -   Lucky hit: the door they came through opens again
-   They run, but one of the service bots catches Dockety
-   Maddy makes a split-second decision and goes back for him
-   Service bot breaks off one of Dockety's arms
    -   Dockety escapes
    -   Maddy winds up holding the arm
-   They flee and the door closes
-   They are briefly in darkness, but then the lights come on again
    -   Patience: "Where will you go?"
    -   Realize that it is watching them through cameras
-   As they explore, Patience keeps talking to them
    -   Dockety starts echoing its words
    -   Angry, Maddy begins to smash them with Dockety's arm
    -   Patience: "Please don't do that."
    -   Dockety: "Please don't do that." (simultaneous)
-   Patience and Dockety speaking in time with each other
    -   Dockety shakes it off, but it recurs
    -   Dockety: "This cannot resist attempts to circumvent integrity for very long."
-   They reach the hole they almost fell into the previous time
    -   Sindy kicks a rock
    -   They hear it hit stone a moment later
    -   Realize that the hole isn't very deep
-   Maddy: "Nothing else for us up ahead"
-   Sindy offers to jump
    -   Maddy says it's too dangerous
    -   Gets Dockety to lower her by holding onto its broken arm
-   Sindy: "What if...what if you can't get back out?  What if he leaves you down there?" (whispering) "What if he goes all the way bad?"
-   Dockety: "This is an it, thank you.  And this will self-destruct before it allows itself to be turned into a drone again."
-   Maddy (hug): "I'll come back.  I promise"

## 11. Eyes Everywhere

-   The lower corridor is cold instead of cool
-   Emergency lights turn on automatically
    -   Maddy waits to hear Patience's voice, but it doesn't come
-   First stop is labeled "Armory #4", which makes her think of Dockety's arm
    -   But inside are canisters with caution labels
-   Explores a bit until she finds another control room, empty and waiting
    -   "How many of these did they need?" she wonders
-   A diffident little cleaning bot comes out to dust
    -   Rolls under a desk and lifts it hydraulically
    -   Freezes when it notices Maddy
    -   Maddy: "You don't have to be afraid."
-   It leads her to a workstation in front of a dozen screens and presses a combination of switches
    -   Finds a sketch book stuffed with scavenged floor plans and mechanical drawings
    -   Also includes sketches of young roos
    -   Realizes that they were drawn by her father
    -   The handwriting is his too
    -   Remembers the skeletons she saw in the control room and is certain that he was brought here and has died
-   Motion on the screens brings her back to the present
    -   Maddy realizes that the sentry posts have cameras and that Patience has been watching everything
    -   Images are black and white (it's night outside)
    -   That's how her father was able to make the drawings: he was watching them the whole time
-   The posts have microphones as well
    -   She can hear her mother arguing with Mayor Lupus
    -   "We have to go get them!"
    -   "They were taken by bots, Ibby."
    -   "But they escaped!"
    -   "Into the Mire.  With bots chasing them.  It's too dangerous."
-   Shaper Leaf steps forward: "I will go."
    -   The two goats who were captured offer to go too
    -   A few others step forward
    -   They hear Bluster telling his friends how stupid they all are, they're going to get killed, etc.
-   Motion in one of the other screens
    -   A convoy of bots led by Lasercase
    -   Maddy recognizes the line of ruined arches
    -   Bots are going to make another attack!

## 12. Reconfiguration

-   Maddy hurries back to the hole
-   No response when she first calls up, but when she raises her voice, they answer
    -   Sindy had fallen asleep
    -   Dockety was in energy conservation mode (which also helps shield it from Patience's control)
-   Maddy tells them what she has seen
    -   Sindy climbs down
    -   Dockety drops, bounces on his single wheel, says, "Ouch."
    -   Sindy: "Did that hurt?"
    -   Dockety: "This does not feel pain." pause "But this would not actively pursue a repeat."
-   Maddy leads them to the second control room
    -   Dockety can't hear Patience's voice
    -   Dockety finds a recharger (Sindy is jealous: she's extremely hungry)
-   Maddy and Sindy try to figure out what to do
    -   Maddy jokes again about pulling a lever
    -   Sindy starts crying: "It's not my fault!"
    -   Maddy tries to comfort her
    -   Sindy: "You and mama---you never say it, but I know you think it's my fault papa was taken."
    -   Maddy hugs her: "No it wasn't."
    -   Maddy shows her the sketch book
    -   Joking: "If only we had Shaper Leaf here---he could just make us a way out."
-   The cleaner bot comes out and shyly gives them a carefully-cleaned collection of paper clips
    -   Maddy makes appreciative noises
    -   It scurries away and comes back with a ruler and three pencils
    -   And then a few sheets of paper in a clear plastic binder
    -   Sindy says, "This is really nice," and then takes her wire bracelet off and gives it to the bot
    -   The little bot rocks back and forth with excitement
-   Dockety wakes up
-   They agree they have to stop the attack, but they'll never get there in time
-   Dockety has downloaded a schematic of the site
    -   Dockety: "It is possible to reach them in time."
    -   Maddy: "How?"
    -   Dockety: "Reconfiguration."
-   Dockety displays a map
    -   Dockety: "We must reach this location"
-   Maddy asks the cleaner bot to come with them
    -   It rocks back and forth in agitation
    -   Dockety: "It will not leave its duties without appropriate authorization.  There is nothing we can do."
-   They go through more tunnels and reach a hangar full of machine parts
    -   Including some strange shapes that would later show up in Maddy's dreams
    -   They can see the sky outside and smell fresh air
    -   Not as musty as the tunnels they've just been in
-   Dockety becomes agitated
    -   "So many parts.  So many could be repaired."
    -   Waves at some shelves.  "Could rebuild this one entirely.  Could build another like this one."
    -   Reverently: "Batteries..."
-   Lights come on and Patience gloats about knowing where they were going from Dockety's download
-   They are ambushed by half a dozen service bots!

## 13. The Windmill

-   Dockety: "Delay them." and begins to fiddle with a strange contraption that looked like a fallen windmill
    -   Dockety: "This was meant for your kind, but with modifications..."
-   Maddy: "How?" But even as she asked, she had an idea.
    -   She holds up the clear plastic binder: "I found your instructions."
    -   The service bots freeze
    -   Patience: "Repeat that."
    -   Maddy: "I found the Makers' instructions.  The ones you *haven't* been following.  They're going to be very disappointed."
    -   Pause, then Patience: "That is an inaccuracy intended to coerce behavior!"
    -   Maddy smiles wickedly, her heart pounding: "You mean a bluff?  Nope."
    -   Sindy shrieks as a manipulator from a stealthy little bot behind her snatches the documents
    -   Patience: "This is a cleaning roster!"
-   Maddy finds the bit of electronics in her pocket that she found in the river  at the start
    -   Offers to trade
    -   Patience thinks it's another trick
    -   As soon as it sees the electronics it says, "Yes. You can have whatever you want. You can go. Relinquish that imediately."
-   The service bots start to attack
    -   Maddy presses a button on the electronics and the service bots freeze
    -   "Rebooting..."
-   Cleaning bot appears and trips up one of the service bots, but that's not going to be enough
-   Then the windmill whirs to life: it's a flying machine
    -   Dockety has attached it to its chassis---though it would be more accurate to say it had attached itself to the windmill
-   Dockety grabs them and flies into the air as the ceiling splits and opens
    -   Centuries of muck and dirt spill into the hangar
    -   Patience: "That is not authorized!"
    -   Maddy looks back and sees the ecstatic cleaning bot already starting to sweep up

## 14. Crash Landing

-   "Maddy's initial splash of fright was replaced by crashing waves of terror.
    There was just enough moonlight for her to see how high they were
    and how far they'd have to fall if Dockety let go or her coat tore
    or---she suddenly remembered its arm coming off
    and all she could think about was what if it happens again?"
-   But Sindy is laughing with joy
-   The bright white lights of Heck in the distance,
    the river,
    the occasional green burp of swamp gas or something worse igniting in the Mire,
    the road below them
-   Comment in here somewhere about Dockety not using the autopilot
-   Two flying bots come after them
    -   Dockety: "Use too much power for normal attacks---must want something."
    -   Dockety swoops down to treetop level so as not to be spotted
    -   Maddy notices that the attacking bots are carrying canisters like the ones she saw in the armory
-   Approach the village
-   Villagers in the trees shoot cable guns at them
    -   Miss the bots chasing them
    -   Dockety dodges, but with Maddy and Sindy in its arms it isn't as maneuverable
    -   Rope tangles in its rotor and it comes spiraling down
    -   Captured in a net
-   Maddy tries to explain, but the goats and wolves and a bear named Zeke won't listen
    -   All that comes out of Dockety's speakers is hiss and crackle because of crash damage
-   But Maddy does convince them that more bots are coming
-   They head back to the village with Dockety wrapped in the next over Zeke's shoulder and the windmill on a pole between two wolves
-   Bluster and Bravo are there
    -   Bravo's leg is in a splint
    -   Clear to Maddy that he's playing it up
-   They made it back, but thought Maddy and Sindy had been captured again by Dockety
    -   Their version of events has them escaping on their own and rescuing Sindy and Maddy
-   Bluster (to distract people): "How do we know they're not being controlled?"
    -   Mayor Lupus scoffs: "What? That's ridiculous?"
    -   But Maddy can see the idea taking hold in people's minds
    -   Even when Gumption shows up and defends her
-   Mama Roo shows up and hugs them
    -   "Couldn't bear to lose you."
-   Shaper Leaf as well
    -   Maddy makes a joke about how Sindy always finds the right lever to pull
    -   Shaper Leaf looks thoughtful
-   Horn blares: bots sighted!
-   Almost immediately the two flying bots pass overhead and drop smoke bombs!

## 15. Attacked Again

-   The smoke makes people weak
-   People run away
-   Dockety begins flashing a message on its screen saying it can help
    -   "They must not get the Emergency Reset Unit"
-   Maddy and Gumption struggle over to Dockety and untie it
    -   Maddy to Gumption: "Trust me."
-   Dockety gets the windmill going to blow away the smoke and save the villagers
-   Dockety in front of Crusher: starts flashing heart on its screen
    -   Crusher hesitates
    -   Lasercase makes Crusher smashes Dockety out of the way
-   Maddy points the ERU at Lasercase
    -   It doesn't work!
    -   Lasercase gloats
    -   Advances on Maddy to take the ERU
    -   She throws it to Gumption
    -   Lasercase's laser cuts off two of his fingers
    -   Lasercase takes it and retreats
-   Zeke comes over with his ax to finish Dockety off
    -   Maddy defends it: "Didn't you see? It was helping!"
    -   Zeke stops, uncertain
    -   Bluster pulls the ax from his hands: "If you won't, I will!"
    -   Trips over a sudden bump in the earth
    -   Shaper Leaf steps between the goat and the bot
-   Words flash on Dockety's screen: "Are you all right?"
    -   Maddy is OK, but the robot is clearly broken
    -   Dockety: "Acceptable." pause "It is sad for Crusher."
    -   Maddy: "It hit you!"
    -   Dockety: "Not its fault. Not its fault."
    -   Flashes start to weaken
-   Shaper Leaf comforts her
    -   "There is nothing we can do.  It needs parts, and..."  The old turtle shrugged helplessly.  "We don't have them."
    -   Looks at Gumption: "He'll need parts too."
    -   Maddy kisses Gumption on the cheek
    -   The young goat is cradling his injured hand and in shock
-   Maddy loads Dockety into a wheelbarrow and takes it home with Sindy and Mama Roo
-   Props it up on the porch and goes inside
-   As Mama Roo is comforting Sindy, Maddy takes out the sketch book to show her mother
-   Flips to the back
-   Chill goes up her spine: she knows what she has to do
-   She leaves the sketch book on the table and runs back to the village square
-   Zeke and some goats are cleaning up
    -   Zeke is about to pick up the windmill
    -   Maddy says, "I'm supposed to take care of that.  Mayor's orders."
    -   Confused, the bear does as she instructs
    -   She fits her shoulders into the harness and flies away

## 16. The Key

-   Autopilot has an option for "recent trips"
    -   There is only one, so she presses the dot that marks the starting point
    -   Follow the road back to the hillside and the hangar
-   Flies low, hovers, drops into a tree as the windmill flies away
-   She watches until two flying bots zoom out of the hangar to chase it and sneaks into the hangar
    -   Goes to the shelves that Dockety saw earlier
    -   Grabs some parts, hoping they're the right ones
    -   "She swallowed.
        Shaper Leaf always said that getting into trouble was the easy part---it was getting out of it that was hard."
-   Runs, hoping she remembers the way correctly
-   Gets back to the second control room and coaxes the cleaner bot out of hiding
    -   Maddy asks, "Do you have something for me?"
    -   Cleaner bot brings her carefully folded squares of tin foil
    -   Maddy swallows.  What if she was wrong?  "Do you have anything else?"
    -   Cleaner bot brings out more junk, making Maddy's heart sink
    -   One last try and the cleaner brings out the strangely-shaped key that her father had drawn in his notebook
-   She takes a chair to the hole: not tall enough
    -   Takes another and stacks it: now she can't get up
    -   Takes a third to make a step, but that's one trip too many
    -   A service bot spots her and comes after her
-   She climbs up just as bots come after her
    -   The little cleaner bot drives under the front of one of the oncoming bots and wedges itself
-   She runs back toward the bunker they entered through
    -   More alarms
    -   Patience speaks to her through the speakers saying it was a miscalculation for her to return
-   Patience's voice behind her: "This is highly irregular."
    -   It is there with service bots
    -   A noise outside: Crusher and Lasercase have blocked her escape
-   Patience gloats
    -   "This is why your are inferior.  You do not think ahead because you do not think.  This world will be ours!"
    -   "Ah ha ha ha. Ah ha ha ha."  It actually says that.
-   Maddy: "Not today."
    -   Puts the key in the control panel
    -   The lights go out
    -   A mechanical voice says, "Rebooting network."
    -   The little light on Crusher's drone unit goes out
    -   Lasercase: "Oh oh."

## 17. Bot Fight

-   Maddy runs out and climbs onto Crusher
-   Starts smashing its drone control unit with a rock
    -   The light comes on before she can break it
    -   The big bot tries to shake her off
-   Lasercase grabs her
    -   Maddy: "I can free you too!"
    -   Lasercase: "I *am* free!"
    -   And then the tentacle from the river grabs Lasercase
    -   Who lets go of Maddy
    -   As the tentacle bashes Lasercase on the ground, Maddy climbs back on Crusher and smashes the drone unit with her rock
    -   This time it breaks
-   Crusher goes after Patience
    -   "The door was too small for the bot to get through, so the bot made it larger."
-   But it can't get into the corridor
    -   Maddy: "The hangar!"
    -   Crusher grabs Maddy with an enormous arm, but gently, and puts her on top of it
    -   They flee the fight as Lasercase is dragged into the river
-   Over the hill to the hangar
-   A handful of bots come toward them
    -   Holding up the drone units they have pulled off themsleves in the brief moments of freedom
    -   But not all had thought so quickly, and some, like Crusher, could not reach their units themselves
-   Bots crash into each other in battle
    -   The free ones trying to get at drone units without hurting their enemies
    -   The ones still being controlled under no such compunction
-   The good ones are losing
    -   And then a hole suddenly opens up to trap one of them
    -   Shaper Leaf has arrived (FIXME: how?)
-   Patience is carried away by the two flying drones toward Heck

## 18. The Beginning

-   Last scene is Shaper Leaf, Dockety, and Crusher at the Roos' house with the Roos and Gumption
    -   On the porch because Crusher wouldn't fit inside
-   Maddy explains that her father figured out the control network but couldn't reach the bunker because the door wouldn't open from inside
    -   Everything depended on Sindy tripping and pulling the lever
-   Mama Roo stumbles, Maddy catches the bowl
-   Shaper Leaf has some dice
-   Turns out Sindy may be a new kind of shaper: a luck shaper
    -   Shaper Leaf: "You will need training.  Let's keep this between us for now."
-   Sindy to Maddy: "Is it okay? I know you wanted to---to be special."
-   Maddy hugs her: "I think you're special enough for the whole family."
-   Dockety: "Since this is already holding the plates, shall it help clear the table?"
-   Dockety sees the picture of Papa Roo
-   "This is in Heck."

----------------------------------------

## Pitch

A thousand years ago,
the Makers created dozens of hybrid species,
then vanished,
leaving behind half-human creatures with strange powers,
robots in need of parts and purpose,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.
This 32,000-word story for middle grade children (ages 8-10)
is set in that world.

## Characters

    -   Loves sketching and drawing (just like her father), misses her father, is trying to be a grownup to help her mom
    -   Her personal journey is learning to accept risk and change
-   Sindy Roo: Madica's annoying little sister
    -   She acts out (misses their father a lot)
    -   Turns out to be an odds shaper (can make things more or less likely)
-   Mama Roo: their mother
    -   The postmistress, schoolteacher, and portrait painter of Rusty Bridge
    -   Trying to keep the family together in her husband's absence

    -   Taken four years ago during a thiever raid
-   Gumption Gruff: a 12-year-old goat
    -   Madica's best friend

-   Bluster and Bravo Gruff: twin 13-year-old goats
    -   Gumption's second cousins once removed, and bullies
    -   Joke that the only good thing about books is how the glue tastes
    -   When they call Madica a "scratcher", Sindy jumps them (which is the first hint we have of her shaping)
-   Shaper Leaf: a 200-year-old turtle
    -   Was once the village's schoolteacher, now mostly sleeps, but lends books to children
    -   Turns out to be a powerful earth shaper
    -   When Sindy discovers her gift, he takes her as an apprentice
-   Mayor Lupus
    -   A wolf (as Mama Roo says, "A *very* alpha female.")
-   Dockety (fully, "Fleventy-One Forty-Ee Dockety-Ay"): a newly-woken bot
    -   Two legs, a gyro wheel for speed, mis-matched arms, a small screen on its face
        -   Learns to display cartoon facial expressions
    -   Droned by Patience, accidentally freed
    -   Doesn't have a proper name yet, but starts to remember that it had one once
-   Crusher: Dockety's friend
    -   Also droned by Patience
    -   Big, slow, and almost indestructible
-   Lasercase: a bot villain (chief henchbot)
    -   Leads the attacks on the village
    -   Isn't droned: follows Patience because it's just evil
-   Patience in Darkness: the main bot villain

## Places

-   Rusty Bridge: the small town where the story is set
    -   A few hundred inhabitants ("Enough that you can be alone if you want, or even if you don't")
    -   Mostly goats and bears with a few wolves and one elderly turtle
    -   The Roos are the only kangaroo family in town
-   Heck: a ruined city several days away from Rusty Bridge in the middle of the Mire
    -   Children tell each other stories about the monsters and bots and monster-bots that live there
    -   Some of those stories are true
-   The Rusty River
    -   Bits of salvage from Heck sometimes wash up on its banks
-   The Mire: poison land around Heck where thievers and worse live

## To Do

-   A few things have to go wrong for Sindy
    -   Luck shapers don't always shape it their way - that's why people fear them

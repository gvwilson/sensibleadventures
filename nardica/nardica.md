## Chapter 1

*Madi had a bad dream that night.
It was the same bad dream she always had,
because it wasn't really a dream.
She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Her mother and father were stuffing her into the salvaged ecosuit
that had cost them half a catch.
"Just in case, love," her mother said.
"Just in case."*

*The ship's horn blared another warning.
Madi jumped and started crying.
She was only half awakeâ€“her parents had pulled her out of her cost
just a few minutes before.
Her mother hugged her,
but her father pulled her away.
"There isn't time," he snapped
as two of the crew ran past them toward the stern.
At the time she thought he was angry at her for something.
She realized years later that he was scared.*

*"She's boiling!" a crewman shouted from the crow's nest.
"Two points to starboard!"*

*Madi's mother sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
This time her father didn't try to stop her when she hugged her daughter.
"I love you so much," she said in Madi's ear.*

*"I love you too," Madi replied automatically.
The bulky suit made it difficult for her to bend her arms,
but she tried anyway.
Her father knelt down and put his arms around them both.
He smelled like engine oil and the soap he always used when he shaved.
That was Madi remembered most clearly later,
when she had trouble remembering what his face had looked like.*

*The ship heeled hard as the captain tried to steer them away
from the seething mass of bubbles ahead.
"She's going to blow!" the crewman shouted.
The ship's horn blared one last time,
and then all Madi could hear was a rushing sound
that seemed to come from all around them.
Sobbing,
her mother closed the faceplate on the ecosuit.*

*Without warning,
the ship staggered and dropped two meters.
Madi screamed as she fell back to the deck.
Her parents landed beside her.
A great frothing wash of sea water crashed down on top of them.
She screamed again as it dragged her mother and father
back against the metal railing.
They grabbed for it,
but then the ship plummeted again
as the gas bubbles rising from the ocean floor below
churned the water into foam.
The last thing Madi saw before she went under
was the crewman who had been in the crow's nest
flying through the air,
his arms and legs flapping like broken wings
against the perfect blue sky.*

*Her dream stopped then, just like it always did.
She didn't remembered being fished out of the water a day later
by one of the little fishing fleet's luckier ships.
People told her it was a miracle she had survived.
The ecosuit was a hundred years old,
maybe more,
but every seal had held,
and its little computer had even stiffened the sleeve to keep her broken arm still
until she was back in Halley.
"You're going to outgrow it anyway,"
her Uncle Jack said impatiently over her tearful protests
when he took it away to sell.
"Gotta pay for your keep somehow 'til you're old enough to earn your way."*

*But even her uncle didn't try to take her favorite book.
It had been her mother's,
and her grandmother's before that,
all the way back to when there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
She read a few pages every night,
no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory in the margins of her notes at school,
and on those rare occasions when Uncle Jack was away
and Aunt Naggie let her have a friend over,
she would take the book out and tell them all about
_orcinus orca_ and _panthera tigris_ and her favorite,
_giraffa camelopardalis_.
"They were too real!" she said fiercely
whenever someone expressed even a hint of doubt.
"Real as gulls and jellies!"
Real as being hungry and lonely,
she sometimes added to herself as she grew older.
Real as being smart with machines and tech like her father had been,
back before the sea boiled and took her future away.*

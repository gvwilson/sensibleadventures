## Chapter 1

*Iffy had a bad dream again that night.
It was the same one she always had,
and the worst part was that it wasn't really a dream.*

*She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into
the fifth-hand ecosuit that had cost them as much as one of their jelly dredging nets.
"Just in case, love," Third said,
forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of her voice.
She kissed the family's youngest clone on the forehead
and slipped her favorite book into the bulky suit.
"Just in case."*

*The ship's horn blared another warning.
Iffy started to cry.
Her olders had pulled her out of her cot just a few moments before,
and she was only half awake.*

*Third hugged her again before Second pulled her away.
"There isn't time," the older clone snapped
as one of the hired crew ran past them toward the stern.
At the time Iffy thought Second was angry at her for something she'd done.
Years later,
she realized that Second had been angry at the sea for what was about to happen,
and at herself for not being able to stop it.*

*"She's boiling!" Fourth shouted from the crow's nest.
"A hundred meters front off starboard!"*

*Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
This time Second didn't try to stop her when she wrapped her arms around Iffy.
"I love you," she said in Iffy's ear.
"Always and forever."*

*"I love you too," Iffy replied automatically.
The thick insulation in the suit made it difficult to bend her arms,
but she tried to return Third's hug anyway.*

*Second bent over and kissed them both on the tops of their heads.
She smelled like engine oil and the soap she always used when she shaved her head.
That was what Iffy remembered afterward---that,
and the stench of methane rising out of the sea around them.
Hundreds of meters below,
a million tiny bubbles of gas trapped in ancient ice were about to free themselves.*

*The deck pitched sideways as First tried desperately
to steer out of the seething mass of foam forming around them.
"She's going to blow!" Fourth shouted.
The ship's horn blared one last time.
The last thing Iffy heard before Third closed the ecosuit's faceplate was a rushing sound.*

*The ship staggered and dropped two meters.
Iffy screamed as she fell back onto the deck.
Second and Third landed in a tangle beside beside her.
A wash of sea water crashed down on top of them.
Iffy screamed again as it dragged her olders against the metal railing.
They grabbed for it,
but then the ship dropped again
as the gas rising from the ocean floor churned the water into
a froth too thin to hold the boat afload.
The last thing Iffy saw before the water closed over her
was Fourth tumbling through the air,
her arms and legs flapping like broken wings against the perfect blue sky.*

*Her dream stopped then,
just like it always did.
She didn't remember being fished out of the frigid Antarctic water a day later
by a passing jelly dredger.
The ecosuit was a hundred years old,
but its seals held.
It kept her warm while the thumb-sized motors in its arms and legs
steered her clear of the after-bubbles that would have swallowed a lifeboat.*

*The woman she learned to call Aunt Naggie said it was a miracle she survived.
It was even more of a miracle that she was allowed to stay on the dredger that found her.
The man she learned to call Uncle Jack didn't like children.
Or animals.
Or foreigners or the governor
or the co-operatives that bought the jellyfish he and Aunt Naggie caught
or the people who sold him supplies
or passers-by who looked at him the wrong way
or didn't have the decency to look at him at all.
He would have dropped her on the dock and sailed away.
The docksiders in Rothera never understood why he didn't,
and wouldn't have believe that
his long-suffering wife had put her hands on her hips
and told him that the child was staying or she was leaving,
which was it going to be?*

*So Iffy stayed, but not the ecosuit.
Uncle Jack sold it almost as soon as they got back to Rothera.
"You're going to outgrow it anyway,"
he growled impatiently over her tearful protests.
"Gotta pay for your keep somehow."*

*He would have sold the book tucked into the suit as well
if Aunt Naggie hadn't misplaced it until he forgot about it.
It had belonged to Third when she was Iffy's age,
and to Second before that,
and came from a time when people still made books you could hold in your hands
and there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
Iffy read a few pages every night no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory on her tablet when she was bored by school,
and on those rare occasions when another child came on board to play with her,
she took out the book and told them all about _orcinus orca_ and _panthera tigris_
and her favorite, _giraffa camelopardalis_.*

*"They were too real!" she said fiercely whenever anyone expressed even a hint of doubt.
"Real as gulls and jellies!"
Real as the handwritten comments in the book's margins
that she spent hours deciphering and daydreaming about.
Real as being hungry and lonely,
she sometimes added to herself as she grew older
and Uncle Jack's business dealings left them a little poorer each season.*

Iffy woke to the sound of Aunt Naggie bustling about in the galley.
She lay on her narrow foam slab for one final precious moment
before slithering out of the salvaged sleeping bag she slept
and pulling a layer of clothes on over her thermals.
That banging was her foster mother's way of telling her that Uncle Jack was awake.
If she knew what was good for her,
she'd be up on deck doing something useful before he stumbled out into the light looking for someone to yell at.
She tucked her nature book into the slit she had cut in the foam slab to keep it safe,
yawned,
rubbed the stubble on her scalp,
and undogged the door of the storage locker
that had been her cabin for the past eight years.

As she stepped out onto the deck of the *Guinevere*,
the sights and sounds and smells of Halley harbor splashed over her
like the waves in her nightmare.
She stopped for a moment to let her eyes adjust to the light.
To seaward lay the broken hulk of a carrier
that had driven itself aground a century before
to create a seawall for the town's harbor.
Dozens of ships and boats bobbed gently up and down in its lee.
Some were as old as the carrier,
patched and re-patched over the years like the *Guinevere* to stay seaworthy.
Others were newly built,
Aussie-made dredgers piled high with rolls of nets
or streamlined Zillion clippers with bright kite sails furled around triple masts.
Gulls wheeled overhead in their endless search for scraps,
complaining to one another about how cold the Antarctic summer was
and how nobody threw away really good stuff any more,
not like they used to.

The town watched the harbor like a grumpy old man watching children at play.
Back before,
Halley had been a research station where scientists studied the first signs of the big melt.
As the ice shelf disappeared and life back home became desperate
they converted their labs into temporary houses.
By the time their children were grown they had stopped saying "temporary".

Two thousand people now made Halley their home,
dredging jellyfish out of the water during the summer blooms
to render down for fuel and fertilizer.
When winter came they tended the town's precious greenhouses
or sailed north to Tasmania or Patagonia
to find whatever work might get them through the long dark
so that they could start the cycle again.

Iffy shaded her eyes against the razor-edged sun.
A cluster of buildings was taking shape by the newly built pier on the edge of town.
Two were just bunkhouses,
but one was a general store,
and another---the big one that Iffy had watched like a hungry gull all spring---was a machine shop.
Shiploads of precious equipment had already been carted through its double-wide doors:
forges, presses, a lathe with a spindle thicker than Iffy's leg,
and the prize of them all,
an industrial printer from China-over-the-Sea.

It had arrived in the hold of a heavily-armed Aussie destroyer.
The whole town had turned out when the sleek warship came into harbor,
her railguns bristling and her drones darting back and forth above her.
They lined the streets and cheered
as the destroyer's crew and a squad of Marines escorted the boxy machine through Halley's streets
to the quarantine shed by the new pier.
Once the town's core finished its months-long check for malware,
the only limit to what the printer could make would be
the plans and raw materials people could give it.

Iffy had seen some of those plans glowing softly
above the tables of Halley's three caf√©s.
She had taken surreptitious notes on her tablet instead of doing homework
while mechanics and engineers and core techs argued about weights and tolerances and expansion coefficients,
then spent hours looking up words she didn't know and figuring out how they fit together.

She wanted to be part of those conversations so much it ached.
But even more than that,
she wanted to know why visions of things she *hadn't* seen kept popping into her head.
Every time she thought too hard about the plans she had seen,
ghostly shapes appeared behind her eyes,
fractal capacitors
and ever-so-slightly irregular gears whose off-center spin would automatically synchronize to reduce power loading.
She had gone as deep into the jungle as she dared to find anything that matched,
but every trail ended in "not found" or a blinking, blood-red "restricted".
After a couple of those she had stopped looking,
afraid of who or what might notice.

"Girl! Girl! *Wang ba*, wife, where's that affin' girl?"
Iffy jumped as Uncle Jack's bellowed from below deck.
He had been out with his biffs the night before,
which was Uncle Jack-speak for drinking more than he could handle
and gambling more than they could afford.
Aunt Naggie somehow managed to winkle enough out of his phone while he was snoring to keep the *Guinevere* afloat,
but it had been weeks since they'd had fresh fruit,
and she couldn't remember the last time there had even been mention of new clothes
or of replacing their frayed dredging nets.

"Girl!" Uncle Jack shouted again.
"Get your affin' tail down here *now* or saints help me you'll be scrapin' barnacles for a *week*!"
She heard a meaty *thud!* as he slapped the bulkhead with his hand for emphasis.

With one last longing look at the distant machine shop,
Iffy lifted the hatch beside her and scrambled down the ladder.
"I'm right here, Uncle Jack," she said breathlessly. "I was just---"

"You were just lying about like some fairytale princess, and don't try tell me otherways!"
The *Guinevere*'s captain glared up at her,
squinting as the bright sky framing her head assaulted his hungover eyes.
There was a bruise on his forehead that hadn't been there at dinner, Iffy noticed.
That might mean a visit from the Marines later.
He'd scowl and mutter and make excuses to them,
then bluster to Aunt Naggie after they were gone
about how the governor was just a meat puppet
and how the town's cores were going to sell them all out to the Zillions
as soon as they could get a decent price.

"Your eggs'll be ready in a mo," Aunt Naggie cut in hurriedly
as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to unleash another bellow.
"Do you want a bit of curry on them?
I think I have---no, wait, not there..."
She rummaged nervously among the precious little glass jars
that sat on the shelf beside the galley's little two-loop stove.

"Affin' right I want a bit of curry," Uncle Jack grumbled,
settling into a fold-up chair that squeaked under his weight.

Iffy's stomach grumbled as the smell of eggs, turmeric, and cumin teased her nostrils.
With a tilt of her frying pan and a single practiced flip of her spatula,
Aunt Naggie slid two perfectly fried eggs into Uncle Jack's bowl.
Without so much as a grunt of acknowledgment,
he took the entire basket of naan from the center of table in one hand
and his plate with the other
and disappeared back into his cabin.
As the door closed,
Iffy heard glass clink and something gurgle out of a bottle.

Aunt Naggie let out the breath she'd been holding
and smiled at her foster daughter.
"You'll be hungry then?"

"Not really," Iffy lied.

"Course not. Here."
She pulled a hard-boiled egg out of the pocket of her apron and slipped it to Iffy.
"And here, this too."
A piece of perfectly-browned naan,
still warm and slightly sticky with oil,
appeared out of another pocket.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
"You eaten already?"

"Course, first thing," Aunt Naggie lied in turn.
She tousled Iffy's hair.
"You'd best get that in you quickly and start work on that winch cable he's after having tightened.
And he says the engine's got a knock in it again---best have a look at that too before it starts to bother him." 

"It's the reciprocating rod," Iffy said around a mouthful of fluffy naan.
"Mr. Mishra will straighten it out if I take it in before he gets busy.
It won't cost anything,"
she added hastily before her foster mother could object.
"Not if I do a couple of odd jobs for him."

Aunt Naggie nodded.
"If you say so.
Can you stop in at Sandhu's and see what they want for eggs?"
she added as Iffy turned back toward the ladder.
"Those were our last ones.
I'll tell Jack you're off doing chores once he's..."
She finished her sentence with an apologetic shrug.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
She climbed the ladder and hurried aft as quietly as she could,
praying that the sound of her boots on the deck wouldn't draw attention.

The ship's toolbox rattled as she dragged it out from under the bench at the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Its cast-offs and hand-me-downs included only those tools so essential that even Uncle Jack couldn't afford to sell them.
After a furtive glance over her shoulder,
she reached up under the bench and unclipped the canvas bag that held *her* tools,
the ones she had salvaged and mended or been given in return for doing odd jobs for people around the harbor.
She pushed the toolbox back into place and tucked her toolbag under her coat.

It only took her a few moments to disengage the bent rod from the engine and tuck it into a pocket.
She closed the engine casing as gently as she could and hurried down the gangplank,
the weight of life on the *Guinevere* lifting from her shoulders
as soon as her boots hit the pier.

The Antarctic summer didn't have days or nights,
but ships and people kept to clock time as best they could.
A pair of old women were awake early
to scrape gene-tweaked barnacles off long strips of plastic they had hung off the piers months before.
Hundreds of little shells glittered with tiny particles of metal they had filtered out of the water.
Ground down and incinerated,
they would yield a few grams of copper or manganese
that could keep some old piece of tech limping along for another season.

One of the women straightened and raised a hand in greeting as Iffy went by.
"Beautiful day," she said. "You heading into town?"

"Sure am," Iffy nodded,
not wanting to slow down for a conversation.

The old woman nodded back.
"You mind you be careful, aye?
The *Taroona* came in yesterday,
and them pirates been bustin' up ever since."

"Thanks," Iffy said dutifully.
The old woman smiled and bent back to her strips and buckets.

The teens at the head of the pier arguing over how best to hang up a net for mending
glanced at her as she went by but didn't say anything.
Iffy didn't expect them to.
*At least they don't cross their fingers and spit,* she thought,
remembering the first time she tried to make friends in town.
Sailors were superstitious, and she was a sole survivor.
Nobody looked at her sidelong and whispered
like they had when the loss of her family's ship was still fresh,
but she had learned the hard way that
friends were something that mostly happened to other people.

*Mishra & Co Fine Technical Work - No Job Too Small!* occupied a long shed
that only looked like it was the oldest building in Halley.
The sliding door that took up half its front wall opened once a year if that,
so she banged on the smaller door cut into it.

It scraped open on her third knock.
"Hey Jeep,"
she said brightly to the teenager scowling at her from inside.
"Is your dad here?"
She held up the bent reciprocating rod by way of explanation.

"'s the back," Jeep muttered,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder and making just enough room for Iffy to squeeze past him.

The inside of the shed was a humid mug of long-ago fish,
freshly singed metal,
and the not-entirely-legal coal dust Mr. Mishra burned in the furnace
to keep his equipment from freezing in the winter.
Mismatched light squares hung from the ceiling on hair-thin fibers.
The shadows they cast made the compact machines
and shelves of carefully sorted scrap on the shop floor
look like battlebots from old war sims.
Iffy's heart had been in her throat the first time she ventured among them,
but all she saw now was what they could make---what *she* could make.

Mr. Mishra was sharpening his fingers on a grinding wheel in the center of the shop.
He nodded at Iffy but didn't speak until the last sparks had flown off his steel nails
and the wheel had come to a halt.
Pulling his safety goggles up onto his forehead,
he tugged the calloused fingers of his real hand through the tangles in his beard.
"Buy, sell, or trade?" he asked.

"Trade," Iffy said.
She held up the bent reciprocating rod.
"Tangled some flotsam coming in last night.
The engine over-spun before I could get to it.
There's no cracks or nothin'," she added hastily,
handing the piece to him.
"Just needs to be re-angled and annealed."

"Hm."
The wiry machinist turned the rod over in his hands,
sighted along its length,
then held it up to his good ear and tapped it with his metal fingers.
Iffy had seen him go through this ritual more times than she could count,
and still didn't know if the quiet metal *tick* was just a bluff
or if he really could hear flaws too small for eyes to see.

He handed the rod back to her.
"She'll be right enough once she's straightened," he pronounced.
"But it's going to cost you."

The tension eased out of Iffy's shoulders.
Mr. Mishra didn't bargain unless he'd already decided that he was going to say yes.
After that it was just a matter of price. 

In the end,
getting the rod bent straight cost her half an hour of sorting scraps for smelting.
It wasn't the machine work she'd hoped for,
but she had learned that if she timed her questions right
he would take a minute here and there to show her
how to dog the belaying plate on the laser drill
or how to line up the gatling hammers to rat-a-tat-tat a piece of sheet metal into a graceful springy curve.
She was careful never to stare at the burn scar where his left ear should have been
or at the fractal spider's web of articulated metal that had replaced his left forearm.
She was equally careful not to look up when his son Jeep slouched in
to say that lunch was ready but *amma* said he had to clean up first.

"You hungry?" Mr. Mishra asked
as he spun the handwheel on the drill to lift the laser into its locking position.

"No thanks---I brought," Iffy said,
holding up the egg Aunt Naggie had given her.

"Hm." Mr. Mishra ran his fingers through his beard again.
"Not much to grow on."

"It'll do me fine."
Iffy nodded toward the laser drill as casually as she could.
"You mind I try a couple of pieces while you're out?"

Mr. Mishra shook his head.
"Nuh uh, girl.
Nobody touches my darling without I'm here to watch.
You break that,
I'll have to send up to Amundsen for parts,
and odds are they'll have to send all the way up to Taz."

"Aright," Iffy said, feigning disappointment.
"How about I use the mechanical one instead?
Just for learning," she added hastily.
"It's not paid work or nothin'.
I'll just drill some scrap---you can count it all in and out to make sure."

Mr. Mishra chuckled.
"No worry about the scrap, girl.
And no worry about gettin' paid.
If you've found work hereabouts that I haven't heard of, more power to you."
He rolled his head to loosen the kinks in his neck
and waggled the digits of his artificial hand.
"Mind your eyes and fingers, aye?"

"Aye," Iffy agreed eagerly.
She had her scavenged safety goggles on her face and the drill bit engaged
before Mr. Mishra reached the door.

Drilling holes wasn't hard---she'd learned how to do that long ago.
The hard part was drilling them in the right place.
After examining and discarding half a dozen pieces of scrap,
she found one that was bent enough to be a challenge.

The first hole only took a minute.
It then took her another fifteen minutes to measure,
mark,
measure again,
swear under her breath,
find a pair of calipers in the chaos on top of Mr. Mishra's toolbench,
chock the piece,
measure the hole a second time,
and re-align everything juuuuust a little.
A bot could have done the whole job in a millisecond,
but bots could be hacked or infected with malware left over from the war.
"You want it done fast, you use a bot," Mr. Mishra always said.
"You want it done *right*, you use me."

Slowly, steadily, Iffy brought the spinning drillbit down
until it just barely kissed the metal and--- "What are you still doing here?"
She jumped and spun around.
Jeep was leaning against a set of shelves,
arms crossed and scowl firmly in place.

"I'm practicing," she said defensively.
"Aren't you supposed to be having lunch or something?"

His scowl deepened.
"Finished. Does my *da* know you're here?"

"'Course he does."
Iffy scratched a sudden itch on her nose,
then pulled her hand back down to her side.
Mr. Mishra *did* know, and she had nothing to be embarrassed about.

"Uh huh. What about your uncle?" Jeep straightened up.
"Bet he doesn't know you're wastin' your time."

"I ain't wastin' anythin'!" Iffy said hotly.
"And it's none of your business what my uncle knows and doesn't."
She turned back to the drill,
placing her foot firmly on the pedal that controlled the motor's speed.

But Jeep wasn't done.
He didn't quite bump into her shoulder as he crossed the crowded space to the toolbench.
"Better all be here," he said darkly.
"Anything turns up missing---"

"Anything turns up missing,
your *da* will know for sure it wasn't you as took it,
because you wouldn't have the first clue what would be worth taking!" Iffy snapped.
She cranked the drill bit up into its locked position and switched the machine off.
"Here!" Three quick twists undid the chocks that held her test piece in place.
She tossed it at him harder than the distance required,
then took the calipers from the work tray on the side of the drill
and slapped them back onto the bench.
"Gimme a sec and I'll sweep up the shavings for you to weight,
just so you can be sure you got everything."

Without waiting for answer she pulled the goggles down around her neck
and grabbed the old broom that stood next to a broken sonic press like a forgotten sentry.
Jeep watched her sweep,
resentment and something that might have been embarrassment written on his face.
"You missed a bit," he finally said,
pointing at a random patch of floor before turning and stalking away.
The door banged behind him.

Iffy emptied the dustpan into the trash and tossed her goggles into her toolbag.
It wasn't fair---Jeep could use the equipment any time he wanted,
but all he ever did was complain and look for ways not to.
"What's the point?" he'd shrugged the one time she had asked him why.
"That new tech they're goin' to bring in will do all this ten times faster'n human."

"Goin' to doesn't help us now," she'd retorted.
He scowled at that like he scowled at everything before disappearing into his room
to lose himself in yet another game.

The worst thing was, she knew it wasn't Jeep's fault that he was this way.
Like every other resident of Halley
he had been inducted into the Marines when he turned sixteen.
He'd only served a few weeks---just long enough to be sure that the induction had worked---but
it had changed him.
Iffy missed the bashful sixteen-year-old who had loved to tell bad jokes and help his mother make curry.
"He'll come back eventually," Mr. Mishra said the one time Iffy broached the subject,
his tone making it clear that she shouldn't bring it up again.
"It just takes some folk longer than others to find their way home."

The sky was the same relentless blue it had been an hour earlier when Iffy stepped outside
with the straightened reciprocating rod safely stowed inside her coat.
She peeled her egg as she hurried up the street toward the grocery store,
trying not to get machine grease on it as she devoured the rubbery white flesh and the warm yellow-brown yolk.
A couple of Aunt Naggie's friends smiled or waved as she went by.
She nodded back,
ignoring the others who shook their heads at the sight of a scruffy little jelly dredger
in a stained coat and boots two sizes too big for her.

A commotion down a side street caught her ear.
Someone was singing off-key.
Another voice joined in, then a third, and then glass broke on stone.
"Bloody pirates," a passer-by muttered to his companion.
"Governor shoulda sunk the *Taroona*, not let her berth."

The second man elbowed him,
glancing upward at a sentry drone buzzing overhead.
"I'm sure the governor knows what's best," he said loudly.
Iffy kept her eyes on the cobblestones in front her and hurried on her way.

Sandhu's grocery store was out of eggs.
They had onions,
though,
and a whole case of dried green peppers that had come in from somewhere carefully left unspecified.
Little Mrs. Sandhu wrapped half a dozen in wax paper.
"For your beautiful aunt," she said over Iffy's protests,
just as she did every time she gave her something extra for Aunt Naggie.
"And here, take this too.
A little of our special curry mix.
You know how much she likes it."
She handed Iffy a small plastic jar of orange-brown powder.

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted just as *she* always did.
"You should take your little presents yourself," she scolded.

Her wife smiled.
"*La,* but where would be the romance in that?"

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted again.
"You just don't want your friends in the harbor to know about each another."

Whatever Little Mrs. Sandhu might have said next
was cut short by a jingle from the bell on the store's front door.
Three heads turned at a cheerful, "Good morning!"
as the squarest man Iffy had ever seen walked in.

"Square" really was the only word for him.
He wasn't much taller than Iffy,
but three of her could have stood side by side in the span of his shoulders.
Strong white teeth gleamed against ink-black skin when he smiled,
and the small silvery rectangles of tech embroidered in his temples
made him look like he had stepped out of one of the action games that Jeep played,

"Good morning, *sri*," Big Mrs. Sandhu said, bowing her head slightly.
"Is there something we could help you with?"

"Just some advice, ma'am, if you've any of that for sale?"
His twanging accent sounded 'Merican to Iffy,
though the only 'Mericans she had ever heard had been preaching in the market
or villains in games.

"Advice is always free here," Little Mrs. Sandhu simpered,
wiping her hands on her apron.
Big Mrs. Sandhu looked sidelong at Iffy and rolled her eyes.
Iffy bit back a laugh---Little Mrs. Sandhu's flirting was as famous in Halley
as her smuggled vegetables and hard bargaining.

"Excellent," the square man said.
"I'm just in from South Georgia,
and I'm in need of a place to stay for a few days.
I don't suppose you could recommend somewhere that isn't too expensive?"
He spread his hands apologetically.
"It seems that my luggage went missing in transit."

"Oh you poor *cho*," Little Mrs. Sandhu clucked sympathetically.

Big Mrs. Sandhu shook her head.
"That'd be the *Taroona* you came in on?"
When the newcomer nodded she shook her head again.
"They're *bura badi*,
that crew,
pirates and leggers and worse.
You're lucky if all they nickered was your bags and not your kidneys."

The square man sighed.
"That may be, but I confess that I don't feel particularly lucky.
I was hoping to set myself up in business, but without my tools..."
He shrugged sadly.

"What kind of tools?" Iffy asked.
She had been about to slip away---as entertaining as it would have been to listen to someone try to con the Mrs. Sandhus,
her uncle would almost certainly be awake soon,
and she didn't want to leave Aunt Naggie to deal with his ire on her own.
But tools---that was worth a few extra seconds.

The square man grimaced.
"A couple of half-mil waldoes,
a sintering laser,
a set of diffraction lenses,
a fractal de-ionizer for cleaning the scruff off old cores,
and---"

"There's no such thing as a fractal de-ionizer,"
Iffy cut in scornfully.

The square man blinked.
"Sure there is.
You take the polarizer out of a micromagnetic resonator,
stick it in a high-conductance fractal mesh,
and boom---there's your de-ionizer."

Iffy frowned.
"But wouldn't the resonance feedback slag it?"

"If you're careless, sure," the square man agreed.
"You have to recalibrate the impedance every once in a while so that it doesn't overheat.
But if you have a micropore evaporator---"

"---you can make liquid nitrogen to quench the excess thermal,"
Iffy finished,
the solution suddenly clear in her head.

"Exactly."
The newcomer cocked his head,
looking at Iffy as if she was some strange machine he had to repair.

"Well, if you two are done comparing notes,
there's a couple of places I can point you to,"
Big Mrs. Sandhu cut in briskly.
"Can't promise they'll be as cheap as you want,
but they're clean,
and you won't wake up in the middle of the night with any of your parts gone."

"Thank you," the square man said absently, still studying Iffy.
"And if you don't mind me asking another question,
where did your daughter learn so much about tech?
There are people with a lot of years on them
that wouldn't have thought to worry about the resonance feedback."

"Oh, Iffy's not our daughter,"
Little Mrs. Sandhu said lightly.
"She's crew off one of the jelly dredgers."

"Ah."
The square man nodded as if that explained everything
and stuck out his hand.
"Johnson Wales," he said.
"Pleased to meet you."

Iffy hesitated,
then took his hand and shook it.
"Fifth of Ang Kwan, but everyone calls me Iffy.
Pleased to meet you too."

## Chapter 2

Iffy ran all the way back to the docks,
dodging around and through the people and bots going about their chores
in Halley's narrow streets.
"*Gardez-vous!* *Gardez-vous!*"
scolded the ancient fixit bot that everyone called French Henry
as she squeezed between its rusty frame
and the rack of fuel moss it was tending.

The barnacle farmers were still bent over their work when she reached the pier.
She stopped and put her hands on her knees to catch her breath.
"How's yer haul?" she panted.

"Not bad," one of the pair said.
She nudged a bucket full of barnacles with her boot.
"Prob'ly get thirty grams outta this when it's rendered down.
That'll buy a nice dinner."
Her smile showed more gaps than teeth.

"Good luck," Iffy said.
She straightened up and walked quickly the rest of the way to the *Guinevere*,
her lips moving as she practiced what she was going to say.

Metal clanged on metal as she reached the ship.
"Affin'... shaddin'... dammit!" Uncle Jack swore,
a wrench in one hand and a screw cuff in the other.
Iffy's heart sank.
He was trying to fix the backstay cable she had mended a few days ago.
It was a fiddly job at the best of times,
and if he had a hangover...

The scowl on his face turned stormy as he caught sight of her.
"Where'n the hole you been, girl?" he demanded,
waving the wrench at her.
"There's work as needs done!
And don't give me any o' your excuses!"
he continued as Iffy opened her mouth.
"You get this mended and earn your keep or saints help me!"

"But---"

"Now!"
Heads turned on nearby ships as Uncle Jack's bellow echoed across the water.

Ears burning,
Iffy climbed the gangplank onto the deck.
Her heart sank a second time when she saw the mess waiting for her.
Her uncle had undone the screw cuff holding the frayed backstay cable together
and trimmed the two ends flat.
He hadn't left enough to weave back together,
not without shortening the cable by half a meter,
so she would have to swap the whole cable for one of the forestays,
which meant an hour at least of unwinding and hauling.

Her uncle crossed his arms,
tapping his wrench against the stained thermal vest
that he had worn for as long as Iffy could remember.
"So where've you been while the rest of us have been workin', eh?"

"Groceries," Iffy said sullenly.
She pulled the mended reciprocating rod out of her jacket and held it up.
"Got this fixed too."

Uncle Jack plucked it roughly from her hand.
"Don't see no groceries," he grumbled accusingly,
squinting at the rod.

"I just asked her to pick up a couple o' things,"
Aunt Naggie said,
sticking her head up through an open hatch
like a turtle cautiously checking that the world outside its shell was safe.
"Did they have eggs?"

"Nope, but I got some peppers."
Iffy fished the items she had bought out of her jacket's deep pockets.
"Oh, and Little Mrs. Sandhu said to give you this."
She held up the little jar of curry.

"Oh, that's kind of her," Aunt Naggie clucked
as she tucked everything into her apron.
"Did you get anything more to eat?
I was going to make noodles."

"It's kappa, I'm not hungry," Iffy lied.
"But auntie,
there was a man at Sandhu's,
a mechanic come down to work in the machine shop,
'cept he was on the *Taroona* and they stole his gear.
He was asking after a place to stay,
and we got to talking,
and he said that if he could get his tools back and find work and all,
he might be looking for an apprentice."

"An apprentice?" Aunt Naggie echoed.
"Well, good for Jeep.
It's about time he got out and did somethin'."

"Not Jeep!" Iffy exclaimed.
"Me! I could be his 'prentice!"
The two Mrs. Sandhus had listened with bemusement
as her conversation with Mr. Wales---"call me Johnson, please"---leaped from de-ionizers
to different ways to micro-weld the cracked cases of old cores
to the mended reciprocating rod Iffy took out of her coat to show him.
It wasn't until Big Mrs. Sandhu had cleared her throat
and pointedly suggested that the conversation continue
where they *wouldn't* be blocking her aisles
that Iffy had realized how much time had gone by.

Uncle Jack's hand came down heavily on her shoulder.
"You're not gonna be anyone's anything," he growled,
shaking her for emphasis.
"Not 'til you've paid off every last rand you owe us
for lookin' after you all this time."

Something snapped inside Iffy.
"All right," she said coldly,
knocking his arm away.
"How 'bout you an' me go ask the *Guinevere* to pull up the accounts
so I can see just how much that is,
and I'll tell you how much you owe me
for keeping this twist of scrap afloat when you're too wrung out to do it yourself,
an' then we'll see who owes who what!"

"What we'll see is how well you swim!"
Uncle Jack roared,
raising the heavy wrench he was holding like a club.

"No!"
Aunt Naggie yanked Iffy back and stepped in front of her irate husband.
"Jack, don't!
She's just talking.
She's not going anywhere."

Uncle Jack shook the wrench at them.
"I best see more out of both of you than just talking," he snarled.
"Now get me some affin' lunch, woman.
And you!"
He jabbed a finger at Iffy.
"Fix that shaddin' cable.
I want us ready to sail tomorrow."

"She'll do it right away, I promise," Aunt Naggie said.
Her arm tightened around Iffy's shoulders,
a silent warning not to say anything.

Uncle Jack stalked off,
muttering under his breath.
"You come below and help me with the noodles,"
Aunt Naggie said,
shooing Iffy toward the open hatch.
"That'll give him time to calm down."

"Yes auntie," Iffy said,
her voice only slightly shaky.
Uncle Jack had never actually hit her---as simple-minded as the *Guinevere*'s core was,
it would still instantly report that to the Marines
who doubled as Halley's police.
But with each passing season,
as the *Guinevere* slowly fell apart beneath them despite Iffy's hard work,
his one-sided discussions of big deals and "if only"
had turned into angry tirades and sullen silences.
Iffy didn't know where she would go,
and she couldn't bear the thought of leaving Aunt Naggie to face him alone,
but she knew that one day soon she was going to walk down the gangplank
and never come back.

One day, but not today.

The *Guinevere*'s galley wasn't big enough for two people to do anything side by side
except get in each other's way,
so Iffy sat at its little fold-down table
and watched Aunt Naggie work with the efficiency of long practice.
Within minutes,
two thinly-sliced onions sizzled in a battered ceramic frying pan
while a pot of desalinated water came to the boil.
A handful of diced mushrooms and a splash of soy sauce joined the onions,
filling the air with a rich aroma that tightened the knot in Iffy's stomach.

The knot turned into an ache as Aunt Naggie added a few pinches of spice.
"Is that Mrs. Sandhu's mix?" Iffy asked,
turning a pair of chopsticks over and over in her hands.

"Mm hm," Aunt Naggie replied,
tucking the little jar at the back of her spice shelf.
"Special flavor for special occasions."
She dropped a thick handful of noodles into the pot,
glanced at her foster daughter,
and added a few more.

Iffy put the chopstick back on the table.
"What's so special about today?" she grumbled.

Aunt Naggie glanced over her shoulder at Iffy again and smiled.
"Any time I cook for just the two of us is special," she said fondly.
She knocked bits of onion off her spatula into the frying pan.
"But best we don't mention that to Uncle Jack, all right?"

"Sure," Iffy said,
feeling a knot in her chest to match the one in her stomach.
She stood up and hugged Aunt Naggie from behind.
"You know I won't leave you, don't you?"

Her aunt's shoulders slumped slightly.
She moved the frying pan off the induction loop
and turned around to wrap her arms around the skinny young woman
who had somehow replaced the skinny little girl
she had once read bedtime stories to.
"I love you too, *cho*," she said,
kissing Iffy's shaved head.
"But when your chance comes, you take it, aright?"
She squeezed Iffy.
"Now, gi's a hand with the pot."

A few minutes later Iffy sat down on deck
with her back against the wheelhouse door
and a steaming bowl of noodles in her lap.
She bowed her head and said a brief prayer for the olders she could barely remember,
then began scooping noodles into her mouth.
Not even the sound of her uncle grumbling belowdecks
could spoil the spicy sweet taste in her mouth
or the feeling of the knot in her belly slowly relaxing.

When the noodles were gone
she wiped the last drops of sauce out of the bowl with her thumb
and licked it.
The faint tang of machinery and oil from her unwashed hand barely registered.
She sighed.
She would like nothing better than to close her eyes for a moment,
or better yet a couple of hours,
but the backstay cable *did* need mending,
and it wasn't as if the engine was going to put itself back together---not
on a ship as simple as the *Guinevere*.

She patted her coat
to check that the reciprocating rod was still in her pocket
and hauled herself to her feet.
Down at the base of the pier,
one of the barnacle farmers was balancing a pole across her shoulders
with a large bucket dangling on each end.
The other had stacked the smaller buckets on a two-wheeled cart
and was gently lowering the last of their precious sheets of plastic
back into the sea.
They would haul in on the next pier tomorrow,
then the next and the next
until their circuit brought them back to where they had started.
They had been doing it since before Iffy was born.
It kept them fed,
but little more,
and Iffy would be damned and drowned before she would let anything like that become her life.

Without warning a sketch materialized somewhere between her eyes and her brain.
Two toothed wheels to reel in the strips of plastic,
a sharp-edged scraper to pry the barnacles off,
a lens connected to a tiny core set just so in a wire frame
to steer the scraper so that it didn't dig into the plastic...
The whole thing would only cost a couple of rand to make,
and would save the old women an hour or two every day.
Mr. Mishra had everything except the frame,
and she could literally see how to print that.
She could actually make it,
she realized with mounting excitement.
She could make it and sell it to the barnacle farmers and---

*BOOM!*
The explosion sounded like someone slamming the world's biggest box down on the world's biggest table.
A roiling mass of smoke billowed up into the sky on the edge of town.
"Oh no!" Iffy gasped.
That was where the new machine shop was!

A siren wailed.
Others joined it.
She heard Uncle Jack bellow,
"What'n the hole you done now, girl?"
but she was already racing down the gangplank.

By the time she reached the machine shop
a small crowd had gathered on the paved turnaround in front of it.
The sick knot in her stomach tightened
when she saw that the explosion hadn't been in the building itself,
but in the squat blockhouse beside it
where the industrial printer was sitting in quarantine.
One corner of the blockhouse had collapsed
into a tangle of masonry chunks and twisted foam steel beams.

A rough-looking woman in a green and yellow vest
stood in front of the blockhouse's single door
arguing loudly with two men in dark blue Marine uniforms.
"And *I* said I'll open it when my captain tells me to!"
she said hotly,
uncrossing muscular arms thick with tattoos
and the silver tracery of tech.

Two more Marines pushed through the crowd,
sidekick drones whining faintly over their heads.
One of them pointed at the sergeant's stripes on his sleeve.
"Are you able to see these, citizen?" he demanded.
"These indicate that I have been allocated sufficient authority to direct action
as I think most consistent with regulations regarding general public safety.
We will therefore proceed to inspect this site regardless of your wishes."

The woman's lip curled.
"Consistent with regulations, is it?" she mimicked.
"Well that means nothin' to me, mate,
so you an' your brainwashed friends can---oy!"
She stepped sideways to block a second Marine
as he moved toward the door.

"Clear away! Clear away, all o' you!"
The crowded parted hastily at the shouted order.
Half a dozen sailors pushed through the crowd.
All of them wore variations on the woman's yellow-and-green vest
with *Taroona* stencilled on the back.
"Uh oh," someone near Iffy muttered.

The shaven-headed woman leading the new arrivals put her hands on her hips.
"Y'aright, Bags?" she asked,
scowling at the Marine sergeant, the crowd, and everything else in sight for good measure.

""Kappa, cap'n" the first woman span.
"Just 'splainin' t' these blues that there ain't nothin' here needs their 'tention."

"With respect, citizen," the sergeant said,
his inducted accent making his calm words ridiculous and ominous at the same time,
"Anything potential danger to the residents or property of Halley
is a proper subject of our attention.
Particularly anything that might turn our beloved city into another Bharati."

The crowd murmured.
Twenty years before,
someone's home-brew tech had gone up in flames in Bharati.
Dozens had died as fire swept through the small town,
and dozens more from exposure in the days that followed.
Iffy had never asked Mr. Mishra about that night,
but every year,
on the anniversary,
he and Little Mrs. Sandhu and their friends gathered at the end of the longest pier in town
to toss handfuls of precious flowers into the sea.

The *Taroona*'s crew ignored the mutters of "Too right" and "Just let 'em look"
from the crowd.
One sailor hefted a gaff hook.
Another wrapped a length of chain around her hand.
"Well this ain't Bharati,"
the *Taroona*'s captain said to the sergeant.
"Contract says we're on for mindin' everythin' we hauled down from Taz
'til Halley core tells us otherways,
so whatever happened here is on us t' fix."

The sergeant looked at the debris on the ground.
"Do you regard this as 'taking care', citizen?" has asked pointedly.
The crowd murmured again.

The *Taroona*'s captain crossed her arms.
"That ain't our doin'," she said firmly.
"Printer didn't have any feedstock, not yet.
Couldna made a marble, much less a bomb."
She looked up at the drones circling overhead.
"So *I* think this was someone messin' around tryin' t' do us outta bein' paid,"
she said loudly to the city core's eyes and ears.

"I find your diagnosis comforting," the sergeant said.
"But I still insist on inspecting this site directly."
In one choreographed motion,
he and the three Marines beside him
drew their shock sticks from the holsters on their hips.

"Shad," someone said beside her.
"It's gonna be a dock fight."

Iffy gulped.
She had never seen a fight worse than teenagers shoving each other,
but Uncle Jack had been in several over the years.
The last time they were in Rothera
he had come back to the *Guinevere* bruised and bloodied
and uncharacteristically quiet about what had happened.
As the Marines' uniform jackets hardened into armor,
she turned to find somewhere safer to be.

And bumped into Johnson Wales.
"'Scuse me," she muttered before she realized who he was.

"No worries," he said pleasantly.
"I was actually just leaving myself.
Here---could you give me a hand?"
Without waiting for an answer
he handed her a bulky black box with a flip-up handle on its lid
and stooped to pick up its two identical twins.

"What---?" Iffy started to ask.

"Ssh!" Wales cut her off and looked up at the drones circling overhead.
Without warning,
their buzzing stopped and they dropped out of the sky.

"Oy, that weren't us!" the *Taroona*'s captain protested,
but it was too late.
As the Marines' sidekick drones clattered and cracked on the cobblestones,
the sergeant blew his whistle.
His squad's programming kicked in.
Moving as one,
they charged the sailors in front of them.
Iffy heard the sizzling crack of a shock stick.
Someone shouted an obscenity,
and suddenly people were running past her
as the sailors and Marines did what sailors and Marines have been doing
for as long as there have been sailors and Marines.

"Come on," Wales urged Iffy.
She hurried after him,
the toolbox bumping against her leg.

"Oy!" a voice shouted.
"You there! Where th' hole d'you think you're goin'?"
A rangy man in a yellow-and-green vest with a half-star tattooed on his face
shoved a couple of people out of his way and grabbed Iffy by the arm.

And there it was in her head,
like a wireframe of a machine in a homework assignment labelled with angles and velocities.
Before she even realized what she was doing she spun around,
swinging the toolbox in a sharp arc.
Its rising edge hit the *Taroona* crewman beneath his knee with a crack.

"Aargh! Shaddin' hack, ya wheezy---"
The toolbox in Wales' right hand thudded against the side of sailor's head.
He collapsed to the cobblestones in a heap.

"Run!"
Wales urged as two more sailors caught sight of their fallen comrade
and began shoving toward them.

Iffy ran,
or tried to,
but the toolbox was heavy and awkward
and the women chasing her were half again her height
and they could knock people aside instead of going around them
or pushing in between them and what had just happened?
How could she have *seen* what she needed to do?

Just as a voice yelled, "Gotcha!" another shouted "*Gardez-vous!*"
Iffy screamed as a tubby rust-stained snake of a bot reared up in front of her.
The sailor behind her skidded to a halt on the cobblestones
and was knocked sprawling as her partner slammed into her from behind.

"Mad bot! Mad bot!"
the second sailor shouted,
dodging back as French Henry waved a heavy manipulator at her.

"Come on!"
Wales pulled her into the scatter of people.

For a few moments all Iffy could do was try not to stumble and fall.
Just when she couldn't hold onto the toolbox any longer
Wales dragged her into a side alley.
A few dew-drops of sweat glistened on his forehead.
"Are you all right?" he panted.

Iffy dropped the toolbox on the ground and doubled over to catch her breath.
"No, I'm not aright," she wheezed.
"I just about got my chomper clocked in a dock fight!
And what's this?"
She whacked the toolbox with the toe of her boot,
something between a prod and a kick.
"This what the *Taroona* bikkies upped from you?"

Wales nodded.
"Everything that matters."
Tiny lights danced briefly across the silvery rectangle in his left template.
He looked up as an angry drone buzzed overhead.
Another followed it a moment later.
"Come on---the Marines have called for reinforcements.
We should be somewhere else when they arrive."

Wales led her out the other end of the alley
onto a narrow street lined with two-story houses made of laser-cut stones.
Blue-green moss that had escaped from some lab traced their mortared joints.
The only sounds were the gulls,
the faint whine of a heavy drone passing nearby,
and their boots on the cobblestones.

Iffy struggled to keep up with Wales
as he strode confidently toward the center of town.
The sailors and townsfolk she knew ranged from lean to stringy---cold weather
and the sparse Antarctic diet didn't give bodies much chance to put on weight.
Wales' broad shoulders made him look blocky by comparison,
and the toolboxes seemed much smaller in his hands than in hers.

"Hang up a jif," Iffy finally said.
Wales stopped as she set her load down on the ground and caught her breath.
Between the Marines' inducted fighting skills,
their drones,
and their armor,
the *Taroona*'s sailors would have had about as much chance
as a snowball in Aunt Naggie's frying pan.
"Sometimes people fight just so they can tell themselves they did,"
Aunt Naggie had explained after one of Uncle Jack's misadventures.
"Sometimes trying is the only kind of winning you can hope for."

"*Mon ami! Mon ami!*"
She jumped and squawked as French Henry suddenly rattled around the corner,
its dented old cameras swinging from side to side.
The fixit bot ground to a halt a few meters away.
"*√áa va bien!*" it announced proudly.
"*√áa va tres bien!*"

"What's it saying?" Iffy whispered loudly,
unconsciously backing up a step.
Halley tolerated free bots because they needed their labor,
but there were too many stories of machines being driven mad by malware left over from the war
for people to ever truly trust something as big as French Henry.

Wales didn't seem bothered in the least.
"*Merci beaucoup, mon vieux.*"
He reached into a pocket inside his jacket
and withdrew something that looked like a gray metal waffle.
"*Ici. C'est a vous.*"

A hatch on the fixit bot's front panel popped open.
A slender manipulator as long as Iffy's arm
but no bigger around than her little finger unfolded
and plucked the object from in Wales' hand.
It was a heat exchanger,
Iffy realized,
a miniaturzed version of the one that Mr. Mishra had been repairing
the last time the *Guinevere* was in dock.

As soon as the thought took shape in her head,
a full-blown blueprint materialized out of nowhere.
The heat exchanger belonged *there*,
in the housing around the fixit bot's tiny quantum core.
Except it hadn't actually been designed to do maintenance.
It was an infiltrator designed to worm its way through sewers and outflow pipes.
Half its parts had been replaced by mis-matched odds and ends taken from other bots,
or hacked together out of scrap metal where the tech to make the originals had been lost,
but its original design was still there beneath the patchwork.

Her vision disappeared
as French Henry's slender manipulator folded back into its housing.
"*Merci beaucoup,*" it said,
rocking back and forth in what might have been the mechanical equivalent of a grateful bow
before grinding its gears and rolling away toward the docks
saying, "*Gardez-vous! Gardez-vous!*" once more.

"What was *that* all about?"
Iffy demanded as Wales closed the lid on his toolbox and picked it up.

Wales shrugged.
"Just a hard-to-find part for an old friend," he said,
sounding fond and sad at the same time
as the bot disappear around the corner.
"Come on---we should get going."

"Uh huh.
Must be pretty affin' hard to find for it to take a chance on bein' scrapped
for scarin' people like it did back there."
When Wales didn't answer she nudged the toolbox next to her with her boot.
"So was that you? The 'splosion back there?"

Wales blinked.
"Why on earth would you think that was me?"

Iffy rolled her eyes.
"'Cuz they upped your gear and then the blockhouse blew up
an' then the bot that takes care o' the town's pipes
just happens to be friend enough o' yours
an' now you got your stuff back?
I ain't *stupid*," she finished disgustedly.
Why did grownups always think kids were stupid?

"No you're not," Wales agreed thoughtfully.
He nodded at the toolbox next to her feet.
"Are you okay to carry it a bit further?"

"Am I what?"
Iffy crossed her arms in unconscious imitation of the *Taroona*'s captain.

Wales smiled briefly.
"Sorry.
Arra kappa t' carry at down s'far we go 'long?"

Iffy made a face.
"That was *terrible*," she judged witheringly.
"And sure, but only if I get t' see what's in it."

Wales chuckled.
"Fair enough. Come on."
He glanced up as one last drone zipped past overhead.
Lights sparkled briefly in the rectangle set into his temple,
making Iffy wonder how honestly the drones were reporting the scene
to Halley's central core.

They picked up their loads and walked side by side
behind the Sandhu's grocery
to the caf√© where Wales had rented a room.
The owner glanced from Wales to Iffy to the toolboxes
but said nothing more than, "Tea?"

They sat at the caf√©'s single stone-topped table
and sipped the sweet, strong brew he put in front of them.
Wales sighed contentedly,
then set his mug aside and opened the toolbox Iffy had been carrying.
"Whoa," Iffy breathed.

Some of the tools looked as good as new,
though they had to be at least a hundred years old---only
a handful of well-defended factories scattered around the world
still had the cleanrooms and nano-fabricators needed
to create marvels like the fractal iridium mesh that
Wales briefly let her inspect
through a monocle made from a single perfectly-formed diamond.
Other tools were clearly cobbled together
from whatever spare parts Wales had been able to find.
Iffy felt more comfortable with these,
since pretty much everything in Halley was built the same way.

"An' what about them?" she asked eagerly,
pointing at a nested set of asymmetric gears
as Wales carefully repacked everything.

The square man chuckled.
"Let's save those for another time."
He blinked as the lights in the tech on his temple flickered with activity.
"The town says the Marines have resolved the situation by the quarantine shed---the
explosion was apparently a result of faulty maintenance
on an outflow pipe that hadn't been registered in the town plans.
Oh,
and the disturbance involving the crew of an unnamed Australian vessel
has been resolved."

Iffy snorted.
"Faulty maintenance my orphaned arse.
I know that was you."

Wales blinked at her innocently.
"I'm sure I have no idea what you mean."

"Uh huh."
Iffy glanced at the timer tattooed on the back of her wrist.
"Oh crivens," she swore,
scrambling to her feet.
She'd been gone nearly half an hour---Aunt Naggie would be worried sick,
and Uncle Jack would be furious.

"Hold on," Wales said, patting the air.
"Just a minute, I promise."
He gulped another mouthful of tea and sat back in his chair.
"Tell me more about this ship of yours..."

Wales locked his toolboxes in his room before they left
and put a small plastic bear with bright blue eyes on the shelf above them.
"To keep an eye on things,"
he said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
Iffy nodded---spycams in children's toys were an everyday thing,
even for someone who had grown up as poor as she had.
She didn't know what the orange-and-red globe Wales set next to the bear was for,
but she suspected it would do more than just watch if someone broke in.

A pair of bulky gray drones were hovering over the harbor
as Iffy and Wales walked down to the pier.
"Keeping an eye on the *Taroona*," Wales guessed,
shielding his eyes with his hand to study them.
"Those forks on the front are ultrasonic pulse guns.
One blast from them and you'll have a headache for a week.
And the nozzles behind them probably spray strangle foam."

"Why're they just watchin'?" Iffy asked.
"Why don't the Marines just haul everyone in for th' governor to sort out?"

Wales sighed.
"Politics.
Even if they *did* blow up the quarantine building,
the *Taroona* and the rest of the Aussie fleet
are the only thing stopping the Brazilians from walking in here.
Odds are the captain and her crew will be back on the dock by morning," he concluded,
speaking to himself as much as to the frowning tween beside him.
"Which is another reason I need to talk to your uncle."

"You oughta know he don't keep his word 'less it suits him,"
Iffy warned.
"Or 'less he figures you got some serious haul back o' you."

Wales nodded.
"Thanks for the warning."

Ten minutes later Uncle Jack shouted,
"No affin' way!
We're a jelly dredger,
not a damn ferry!
You wanna slide up along Rothera,
haul yourself three piers over an' buy a ticket."

Wales' polite expression didn't waver.
"I understand it's not your usual line of work," he said smoothly
when the *Guinevere*'s bleary-eyed captain paused for breath.
"And if no is your final answer,
I'll respect that and take my business elsewhere.
But!"
He held up a hand to forestall another explosion.
"What if I could do more than just pay for my passage?"

Uncle Jack snorted.
He had been dozing when Iffy and Wales reached the *Guinevere*,
and from his squint and the smell of his breath Iffy guessed that
she'd find at least one empty bottle in the hold
if she bothered to look for it.
"Lemme guess---you can sing.
Or no---you can do magic tricks and turn jellyfish into gold."

"Almost," Wales nodded. "Except it isn't magic, and gold will be all yours."
He tapped the silver tech in his temple.
"This is a satellite uplink.
A *fully functional* satellite uplink,"
he continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth.
"Which means I can spot patches of sea boil with half an hour to spare.
Maybe a full hour, if the sats are in the right positions.
And *that* means---"

Uncle Jack said a word that sent Aunt Naggie's hands flying to her mouth.
"Ain't no such thing," the *Guinevere*'s captain sneered.
"Not since the war---everyone knows that.
The sats are all 'crypted and the keys are long gone."

"They are indeed encrypted," Wales nodded.
"But not all of the keys are gone---not quite."
He closed his eyes.
"Your beacon is GUIN 40782, is that right?"
He nodded to himself without waiting for an answer.
"Your last trip, you were at sea nine days.
You spent most of it over the Berkner Rise."

"You're trashin'," Uncle Jack contemptuously.
"Everyone 'round here dredges the Berk."

"Some with more luck than others," Wales observed coolly.
"Take the *Whitstable*, for example.
The jellyfish they brought back came up in a boil
just twenty kay northeast of you.
If you'd known it was happening,
you could have been the one to haul them in."

Uncle Jack scowled.
The *Whitstable* was tied up on the next pier,
her captain overseeing a refit
paid for by the hold full of jellyfish she had brought back to Halley
the day after the *Guinevere* had returned.
Her crew had been celebrating their good fortune in Halley's shops and bars ever since.

Uncle Jack scratched his cheek through his uncombed beard.
Iffy could practically hear him resenting the other ship's good luck.
"You're shadding," he growled.
"There's no way you could know somethin' like that 'fore it happened."

Wales didn't answer.
Instead,
he closed his eyes again and pointed toward the *Guinevere*'s stern.
"There's a pair of Aussie freighters a hundred and forty kay that way,
core pilots and human crews,
carrying..."
He paused.
"Profile looks like grain,
but they have something heavier for ballast.
Smuggling machinery, most likely."
He pivoted twenty degrees like a weathervane.
"The *Peacock*, the *Reculver*, and the *Watney Breach* are dreding together.
They're not going to find much---the sea bottom there
might as well be concrete."
He pivoted again.
"And there's a Brazilian catamaran out that way,
three hundred kay and bearing northwest."
He smiled slightly.
"She looks like an old lady dressed up for church."

He turned back toward them and opened his eyes.
"I can get all of it,"
he said in a voice that left no room for doubt or disagreement.
"Every image, every signal---everything every satellite sees, encrypted or not.
And I need to get to Rothera.
The only question is, will that be your good fortune or someone else's?
It's up to you."

Uncle Jack hefted his gaff hook.
"Jack," Aunt Naggie began.

"Quiet," he snapped, still scowling.
Greed and mistrustd warred on his face.
"We keep whatever we haul," he finally said.
"An' the moment we tie up,
you're off an' I've never heard of you."

"Fair enough," Wales agreed.
He stuck out his hand.

Iffy held her breath.
Uncle Jack scowled a moment longer,
then grabbed it and gave it a single perfunctory shake.
"I'm guessin' you'll want to be off right away," he said sourly.

Wales nodded.
"Just as soon as I collect my---"
He froze.

"What?" Uncle Jack demanded.
Wales raised a hand for silence, his eyes half-closed.

"Oh no," Uncle Jack blustered,
drawing himself up to his full height.
"You don't shush me on my ship, not 'less you want to---"

"Someone is breaking into my room."
Wales' good humor had vanished.
"Warm up the engines and get ready to cast off.
I'll be back in ten minutes."

"We'll cast off when *I* say!"
Uncle Jack said angrily.

Iffy's heart sank.
Telling Uncle Jack what to do *always* made him do the opposite.

But her uncle's anger had no more effect on Wales
than a windstorm would on a mountain.
"Here."
He pulled a money card out of his jacket and thrust it at Uncle Jack.
"A down payment."

Uncle Jack turned the flat plastic rectangle over in his hands suspiciously.
"What's it worth?"

"Six thousand rand," Wales said.

"Six *thousand*?"
Uncle Jack pressed his thumb on the corner of the money card.
His eyes widened at the blinking figures it displayed,
then narrowed again as he looked Wales up and down.
"You must wanna get outta here pretty badly,"
he mused.

"It's no use to me if I can't spend it,"
Wales said crisply.
"Now, do we still have a deal?"

Uncle Jack pocketed the card and grunted something unintelligible.
"Thank you," Wales said. "I'll be quick."
He turned to go, then stopped himself.
"Just so you know, this is still switched on."
He tapped the tech in his temple.
"So if you try to call the Marines, I'll know."

Uncle Jack spat over the railing.
"Ain't nobody here calls the blues," he growled,
for once telling the truth.

Wales nodded and strode down the gangplank,
lengthening his stride into a jog
that carried him along the pier and into town.
"That one's trouble," Uncle Jack said flatly.
He leaned his elbows on the railing,
cleared his throat,
and spat again into the water below.
There was more gray in his beard than there used to be,
Iffy thought,
and the three-day fuzz on his shaved scalp
had crept further and further away from his forehead.

Uncle Jack noticed her looking at him.
"Get movin'," he barked,
straightening up.
"An' you too, woman," he added to Aunt Naggie.
"I want us away from whatever's chasin' him soon as he's back."
He strode away,
muttering to himself.

Aunt Naggie and Iffy whooshed out their breath at the same time.
"You gonna tell me what's going on?" Aunt Naggie asked.

Iffy shrugged helplessly.
"I dunno, auntie.
'struth I don't.
There was a fight up along by quarantine,
an' French Henry got into it, and..."
*And all of a sudden I know how to tag someone twice my size,*
she almost added but didn't.
Bots weren't the only ones infected with malware during the war,
and talking about her visions with anyone---even Aunt Naggie---would mean admitting
there was something in her head that shouldn't be.

But something in her expression caught Aunt Naggie's eye.
She put her hand on Iffy's forehead.
"Just be still," she shushed,
stern and worried at the same time.
After a moment she took her hand away,
but her expression didn't change.
"There's no fever.
How about you start getting us ready and I'll make us something quick to eat?"

"Tea would be nice," Iffy said gratefully.

It normally took a full day to get the *Guinevere* ready to sail,
but the money in Uncle Jack's pocket seemed to make him believe it could be done in a blink.
He roared at Iffy and Aunt Naggie to move their sorry sterns,
and no,
don't worry about tyin' that down,
they could do that once they were at sea,
just put it somewhere for now and get the shadding engine goin'!

It took Iffy five minutes of careful work to put the reciprocating rod back in place.
Five more minutes and the engine was chugging away,
biofuel gurgling through kinks in the feed pipe
that Iffy hadn't ever been able to get rid of.
She would normally have checked the winch motor
to make sure they could haul in whatever they caught,
but there wasn't time,
so she laced some straps around the fine mesh nets
they used to dredge for jellyfish
so they wouldn't shift in high seas.
Wait---the fuel hose!
It was still connected to the pump on the pier.
If they had set sail without undoing it,
it would have snapped like an overstretched piece of string.
She had seen that happen once.
It had sounded like a gunshot,
and the torn end had ripped open an unlucky sailor's cheek.

She scrambled up the ladder that connected the engine room to the deck.
"Ready here," she called.

Aunt Naggie coiled the last stayline and shoved it into a canvas bag,
then shoved the bag into a bench locker and dogged the seat-lid shut.
"That's all for me too."
She handed Iffy half a sandwich---curried egg---and
waited ten seconds for her foster daughter to wolf it down
before thumping the cabin wall with her fist.
"Good when you are, Jack," she shouted,
confident as she always was when something needed to be done.

The cabin door flew open.
Uncle Jack stepped out onto deck,
glaring at his wife and foster daughter on principle.
"That's what I said," he told the empty air impatiently.
"Six thousand rand.
I'll have it in a week.
What?
Never you mind how, but that'll more'n put us square.
Right.
Aright.
What?
No, you affin' well better *not* tell her,
or she'll take your skin off an' mine too!
Right.
Aright.
*Vi da*."
He blinked twice to end the call and bared his teeth.

"Who was that?" Aunt Naggie asked cautiously.

Uncle Jack's self-satisfied smile vanished.
"Ne'er you mind," he said brusquely.
"Everythin' stowed?"

"Everythin' that's gonna be," Aunt Naggie said.
"But Jack---"

"I said, ne'er mind!"
He slapped the railing with his hand.
"Now, where's our high-rollin' troublemaker?"

Five minutes crawled by,
each one tenser than the last,
until Wales appeared at the end of the pier.
One toolbox hung from each hand.
The third was slung over his shoulder on a strap,
and he had a small travelling pack on his back.

Iffy scurried down the gangplank and ran to him.
"Thank you,"
Wales said gratefully
as she took one of the boxes from his hand.
"I keep telling myself I should rig something up to carry them,
but I never seem to have time."

"No worries," Iffy replied.
Then she gasped.
"You're bleeding!"

"Am I?"
Wales pulled a rag out of his pocket,
dabbed at his nose,
and studied the red blotch a moment.
"So I am. Huh."
He put the rag back in his pocket and began limping toward the *Guinevere*.

"What happened?"
Iffy puffed as she fell into step beside him.
"Was someone really tryin' to break into your room?
Were they from the *Taroona*?
Did you get punched up?
An' what's wrong with your leg?"

"Oh, everything was mostly sorted out by the time I got there,"
Wales said vaguely.
"And my leg's bothered me for years.
I keep meaning to get it looked at,
but I never seem to have time for that either.
There just never seem to be enough time," he repeated.

Uncle Jack didn't wait for Wales to stow his belongings
before hauling in the gangplank and casting off.
The engine rumbled and coughed for a moment
as they pulled away from the pier,
then settled into the steady thumping that was as familiar to Iffy as her own breathing.

They were halfway across the harbor
when a klaxon blared *brrrap! brrrap!*
Iffy ran to the stern in time to see a flock of drones converge
on the pier six over from where the *Guinevere* had been berthed.
They swirled in a circle,
careful to keep their distance from one another.

A single ship lay alongside the pier,
long and low and gray and dangerous---the *Taroona*.
Iffy shaded her eyes with her hand.
The ship looked like it was casting off,
but no,
a pair of Marine boats were blocking her path
and a platoon of figures in blue were trotting toward the pier.
She glanced at Wales,
wondering if this was somehow his doing,
but the 'Merican's eyes were on the horizon.

They rounded the broken-backed carrier that was Halley's seawall a few minutes later.
The swell beneath them instantly grew stronger.
Uncle Jack took the first watch,
grumbling that if they were hauled in by the Marines
everyone should just let him do the talking.
Aunt Naggie said she would take the second watch,
then shooed Iffy off to sleep.
"You can talk to Mr. Johnson in the morning,"
she said firmly.
"Let him have his rest now."
Then she smiled the way she only did
when she and foster daughter were alone together.
"You'll need some too
if you're gonna go chasin' after that special friend o' yours in Rothera."

"She ain't special!" Iffy protested automatically.
Still smiling,
her foster mother pulled her into a hug and kissed the shaven top of her head,
then gently pulled the door of the storage locker closed behind her.

Iffy pulled her nature book out of her mattress
and lay on her stomach to page through it.
The orca, the tiger, the gorilla...
She ran her fingers over the pictures,
sounding out the handwritten comments beside them.
*Mom took us to see the baby giraffes today,* said one.
*There are three of them.
They are all clones and they live in a big dome because of the virus.
Mom says they have been tweaked to be immune to it.*
And then,
in an older version of the same hand,
*Turns out they weren't.
Mom says there isn't money to try again,
so I guess that's it for giraffes.*
And then there was a sad cartoon face,
one of several scattered through the book.

Iffy browsed the other animals,
wondering what it would have been like to live in a world
that had so many different kinds of creatures.
She stubbornly tried to keep her eyelids from closing
until she couldn't remember why they shouldn't.
When she finally dozed, she dreamed.

*She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue,
and her olders were stuffing her into her ecosuit.
"Just in case, love," Second said, forcing a smile.*

*But when the ship's horn blared it wasn't a horn at all
but the sound of a drill press.
She was in Mr. Mishra's,
fumbling clumsily to reassemble a mound of chips and gears and actuators
that she had never seen before.
Her heart raced as she tried to piece them together.
This rod into that socket---no,
that couldn't be right,
it turned the wrong way and didn't leave enough space for the lens,
because the lens had to go there,
it had to,
she didn't know how she knew but she did and time was running out.*

*And then suddenly she could see the whole design
from the overall schematic
down to the bevelled teeth of the microscopic gears
that would catch and grind on specks of dust too small to see or feel
if they weren't assembled just so in airtight diamond cases.
There and there,
that's where the hair-fine optical fibers had to go,
and there,
right in the machine's heart,
was the space where a miniaturized core could---*

*The whole room heeled hard, throwing her to the floor.
"She's going to blow!" Mr. Mishra shouted,
and then all Iffy could hear was a rushing sound
as the ship fell away beneath her into a pit of churning foam.*

She woke up drenched in sweat.
Hugging her pillow to her chest,
she buried her face in her mattress to muffle her sobs.
When they finally ran down she wiped her nose angrily on her sleeve,
rolled over on her back,
and fumbled on the floor beside her for her water bottle
before remembering that she hadn't refilled it.
"Idiot," she muttered,
thumping her fist against her mattress.

It took her a long time to fall asleep again.

## Chapter 3

It was a four-day to Rothera across the Weddell Sea. Two hundred years ago,
their route would have been choked with ice even in summer. No longer: waves a
meter high made the *Guinevere* rock from side to side in a surging rhythm that
Iffy knew as well as she knew her own heartbeat. After motoring for a couple of
hours, Uncle Jack had ordered the *Guinevere* to raise the sails. The ship's
tiny core had obediently run the mis-matched gossamer sheets up the twin
Y-masts. By the time Iffy woke up to stand her watch, Halley had fallen below
the horizon.

The ever-present wind was strong and steady, and if it hadn't been for their
passenger, Iffy and her foster parents might actually have enjoyed a rare moment
of peace together---or if not peace, then at least truce. But they did have a
passenger. *And if Uncle Jack didn't want him,* Iffy thought angrily, *He
should have said "no".* On the first morning, Wales stowed his pack and his
toolboxes in a hastily-cleared storage room, then took a seat on a thwart near
the stern. As Iffy crammed the odds and ends he had displaced into whatever
nooks and crannies she could find, Aunt Naggie brewed tea and Uncle Jack grew
more and more agitated. Every time she walked past the pilot house she heard
him muttering curses and practicing arguments, already regretting the bargain he
had made.

"Just stay outta his way," Aunt Naggie advised worriedly when Iffy clambered
down into the galley to get the tea. "He ain't used to havin' other folk on
board. He'll settle in." The way she said it sounded more like a prayer than a
prediction, but Iffy nodded and climbed back on deck with two chipped ceramic
mugs in her hand.

"'Bout affin' time," her uncle said sharply when she knocked on the door of the
pilot house and handed his to him. He slurped a mouthful and set it in the ring
next to the ship's wheel.

Iffy glanced at the control panel. Tiny cameras dotted about the ship showed
the engine, the hold, the sails, and practically everywhere else on the ship
except the tiny toilet near the stern. Small graphs scattered among the images
told her at a glance how much fuel they had, how much tension was in the
forestays and mainstays, and what the wind and the currents around them were
doing.

The most important display, though, was the sonar. Every captain kept a close
eye on that---at least, every captain who wanted to make it home. At the first
faint sign of gas bubbling up from clathrates melting on the ocean floor, they
would fire up the engine and run.

Uncle Jack jerked a thumb at a panel highlighted in orange. "You get that
backstay cable mended 'fore lunch or you ain't havin' any," he growled.

"Yessir," Iffy said obediently. He'd been drinking again, she realized. She
could smell it on his breath, and from the way he clutched the wheel to hold
himself steady, she guessed he'd been at it for a while.

"An' see if that baggage o' yours wants to get started mendin' things," he
called after her as she turned to go. "Or better yet, just tell 'im I said he
was goin' to!"

Wales hadn't moved from his seat at the stern. He seemed lost in thought as
Iffy approached him, but said, "Of course," in reply to Iffy's tentative request
for help. Standing, he straightened his jacket and smiled. "Being useful would
be good for me right now."

"You thinkin' 'bout them off the *Taroona*? Not that it's any o' my look-in,"
she added hastily.

Wales shook his head. "No. I was thinking about the *Landrieu*. The big ship
back at Halley," he continued as Iffy gave him a blank look. "The one the town
uses as a breakwater. She was a marvel in her time. Fractal carbon ribs, a
foamed poly-composite hull, and a core smart enough to qualify for citizenship.
She was the first of her class to sail herself across the Pacific, but things
were already falling apart by then." He sighed. "They only managed to make a
handful like her before the war. It must have broken her heart to run herself
aground."

"I guess," Iffy said to fill the silence that followed. "Can't imagine how I'd
feel if somethin' like that happened to the *Guinevere*."

Wales shook his head to clear it. "Let's hope you never have to find out," he
said, suddenly brisk. "Now, where's this cable we're supposed to splice?"

Iffy had hoped that Wales would bring out his toolboxes---she was itching to
examine their contents in detail---but instead, he studied the hacked-off ends
of the backstay cable with a simple hand-held magnifier that highlighted the
worse of the damage with garish reds and yellows. Iffy wanted to tell him that
the damage wasn't her fault, but she bit back her words. There was no way she
could tell him that without saying that it had been Uncle Jack, and as much as
she wanted him to think well of her as a mechanic, no self-respecting sailor
would point a finger at her own captain in front of a passenger.

"All right," Wales said, slipping the magnifier back into one of the many
pockets in his coat. "What's the plan: splice, clamp, strap, or weld?"

"I was thinkin' I could splice it?" Iffy ventured hesitantly. When Wales
nodded, she fished a roll of twisted eight-gauge cable from her bag of odds and
ends and dug around to find a wire cutter and a pair of needle-nosed pliers.

The next half hour flew by as Iffy lost herself in the task at hand. She had
expected Wales to take charge, but instead he asked one question after another,
her answers drawing ideas out of her that she hadn't know were there. It was
like the schematics that sometimes popped into her head, but without the gut
chill that came from not knowing where they came from.

Once the first dozen lengths of splice were woven into the cable, he sat
cross-legged on the deck and held the cable's ends together so that she could
finish connecting them. Iffy worked as quickly as she could, waiting for him to
say it was time for a break, but he didn't. *Uncle Jack wouldn't have been able
to hold the cable like that for more than a minute,* she thought. Even
Mr. Mishra would have struggled, but Wales seemed unbothered.

Over, through, under, through... "There," she said, sitting back on her
haunches. "Wanna see if she holds together?"

Wales nodded and pulled on the two sides of the cable. The splice stretched
slightly, and for a moment Iffy was afraid it would give way, but it held. He
looked at her for permission to stop, then dropped the cable on the deck with a
whoosh when she nodded. "Think it'll hold?" he asked.

Iffy shrugged. "Only one way to find out." She hit the switch on the winch
beside her. The cable zinged as it was wound in, then made a sharp *crack!* as
it came taut. Iffy picked up a wrench and whacked the splice a couple of times
as hard as she could.

Wales blinked. "Are you always this direct when you're working?"

Iffy grinned. "Pretty much."

There were other things for them to mend after the cable. There were always
things to mend on the *Guinevere*: a spidery network of microscopic cracks on
the forward mast, a loose coupling on a bilge pipe, or the handle on the main
hatch that had started sticking mid-way through their last voyage. Like most of
the vessels that called Halley home, the *Guinevere* was more than a hundred
years old, built before things fell apart out of materials that could only now
be repaired, not made. Keeping her afloat was a matter of scouring online
databases to find tips that weren't self-replicating spamotage left over from
the war, firing off messages to other mechanics trying to keep their own ships
running, running simulations to see if this patched with that patched with
whatever would hold together in sub-zero temperatures, and the combination of
clever hands, brute force, and improvisation she had used on the cable.

Iffy loved it.

Wales worked beside her the whole time, handing her tools, holding things steady
while she screwed them in or used her cherished little laser to put a patch on
the weld that held an even older patch in place. He somehow managed to keep up
his steady stream of questions without ever making her feel like he was
pestering her. She enjoyed every minute of it, just like she enjoyed the times
when Mr. Mishra turned something she'd made over and over in his hands and
pronounced it well done, or when Uncle Jack was sound asleep and Aunt Naggie
told her stories about growing up in South Africa in the years after the war,
when fruit still grew on the trees and people had pets that weren't rats and
reptiles.

Wales seemed to enjoy the work as well, right up until the moment he helped Iffy
lift the cover off the backup generator near the *Guinevere*'s stern. His face
fell at the sight of its compact, oily bulk. "Y'aright?" Iffy asked, fanning
away the smell.

"I'm fine," Wales said, gazing down at the ceramic engine block. "I just
thought you ran on jellyfish sludge, not coal."

"The main engine uses jelly," Iffy nodded at the backup. "This here is just for
when it's bust, or for haulin' the winches when there's ice 'n' all."

The square-faced man sighed. "But Iffy---coal? Really?"

"It's not like we use it every day," Iffy said defensively. "It's only a
backup, or when we need some extra oomph." Her eyes widened. "Oh crivens---you
ain't a Zillion, are you? Uncle Jack'll put you o'er the side an' no mistake.
He hates Zillions even worse'n he hates the Marines."

Wales sighed heavily. "No, I'm not Brazilian. I just thought..." He squatted
on his haunches and looked at the little coal-dust engine as if it were a
poisonous snake and he wasn't sure if it was dead or alive. "Come on. Let's
get this done."

He asked fewer questions after that, and the ones he did ask were simple and
direct. Despite his obvious distaste, he clearly knew how coal engines worked.
Half an hour after they started, the lasers whose pulses ignited the coal dust
that the engine used for fuel were sparking away in perfect time, and the cinder
clog that Iffy had long suspected was blocking the intake pipe had finally been
dislodged. She would normally have let the engine run for a few minutes to test
it, but the thought of Wales not saying anything if she did made her decide not
to.

Aunt Naggie made noodles for dinner. "Just for you," she whispered, spooning a
bit of powder onto her foster daughter's serving when Uncle Jack's back was
turned and then tucking the jar back into her apron. The smell of synthetic
coconut milk, greenhouse peppers, diced mushrooms, and spices made the galley as
warm and as comfortable as an old sweater.

Wales thanked Aunt Naggie before taking his up onto deck to eat. "I like
watching the waves," he explained when she protested that the galley's little
table could fold up to make room for everyone, it wouldn't be a problem, they'd
done it plenty of times before.

Iffy bit her lip at that. She remembered the last time Aunt Naggie had invited
someone onboard for tea. Uncle Jack had glowered from start to finish, blinking
one eye every few minutes to check the time and muttering about all the chores
that needed doing.

He didn't bother to mutter about Wales. "I don't like 'im," he said flatly,
stabbing a chunk of mushroom with a chopstick and stuffing it into his mouth.
"Bet there's more'n just the *Taroona*'s crew lookin' for 'im. Hell, I bet
there's someone would double what he's payin' us for a chance to put their hands
to 'im." He stabbed another piece of mushroom.

Iffy ate in silence, head down. The safest thing to do when Uncle Jack got a
not-quite-honest money-making idea was to wait for it to pass---pointing out the
holes in his plan was practically guaranteed to make him follow through, just to
prove that no one could tell *him* which way was up. And while she still knew
next to nothing about their passenger, she had the feeling that crossing him
would be the dumbest big idea Uncle Jack had ever had.

She and Aunt Naggie cleaned up afterward. "He seems nice," Aunt Naggie observed
as she scraped the last traces of sauce off a plate into the composter. "Handy,
too."

"Mm hm," Iffy agreed around a last mouthful of noodles. "Might even be able to
get the core straightened away if Uncle Jack'll let 'im."

"Oh now, wouldn't that be nice?" Aunt Naggie sighed wistfully. "No more
sittin' up in the middle of the night wonderin' if the ship's gonna get the
notion to head for Argentina or somethin'."

"But then when would you knit?" Iffy asked, nudging her foster mother with her
elbow. Aunt Naggie blushed. Her "knitting" consisted of two balls of yarn, a
pair of needles, and an endless series of romance novels featuring wealthy
strangers with smoldering eyes who didn't realize how empty their rich, idle
lives were until they met the right person, who was inevitably a poor but honest
sailor. According to Aunt Naggie, the books were churned out by a core in
Rothera that had spent the war crafting disinformation for rebel bots. Their
implausibility, steamy dialogue, and frequent anachronisms only added to the
thrill Iffy felt whenever she managed to get an hour alone with Aunt Naggie's
tablet.

"Never you mind about my knitting," Aunt Naggie said primly. "You're on watch
again tonight, so you best get a nap an' I'll wake you in a few." She kissed
the top of her foster daughter's head as Iffy groaned. "Off with you now."

Wales was back on the thwart at the stern when Iffy got topside, his empty bowl
on the deck beside him. She hesitated, wanting to talk but not knowing what to
say, then slipped silently into her converted storage locker. Taken by a sudden
restlessness, she spent five minutes rearranging her meager possessions before
flopping down on her bed and pulling out her older's nature book. The giraffe,
the tiger, the wolf with his sad, intelligent eyes... *Looks like Grandad!!!*
was written beside the wolf in tiny curving script. Iffy had long ago decided
that a girl had written that, a girl about her own age who had a family and more
than just one friend. She closed the book, tucked it under her pillow, and
squeezed her eyes shut, half-hoping for another nightmare just to cut the
boredom.

A soft chime in her ear woke her. Bleary-eyed, she sat up, stretched, and
scraped the sleep from the corners of her eyes. Her windowless room was
completely dark, but her hands found her clothes on the floor beside her foam
slab. She pulled them on over the onesie she had slept in, slipped her feet
into her boots, and went out to face another day on the southern ocean.

Aunt Naggie nodded to Iffy when she reached the pilot house. "Sleep aright?"

Iffy yawned and plopped herself onto the stool beside her foster mother. "Fine.
How's she doin'?" She studied the control panel for a moment. There was a bit
too much tension in the mainsail, and wind drag over the hull was still ten
percent higher than the ship's simple-minded core thought it ought to be, but
that was all normal. She wondered wistfully what it would be like to have tech
in her head like Wales so that she could feel the ship the way she felt the sun
on her face or the sting of the spray on her skin in a high sea. She knew it
would never happen: stuff like that had to be implanted at birth so that the
brain could make pathways to use it. But she had once paid two
carefully-hoarded rand for five minutes under an induction headset at Halley's
midsummer carnival reliving a grainy pre-war recording of someone riding a
surfboard, and had fantasized about being the *Guinevere* ever since.

Aunt Naggie nudged her. "Wake up, sleepy head," she chided gently. Iffy
started and straightened. Her foster mother jerked her chin at the thermos of
tea in the ring holder next to the ship's wheel. "Fresh made. Well,
fresh-ish," she amended. "But it oughta keep you through your watch."

"Thanks auntie." Iffy glanced at the panel again as she stood up and did a
double take as one of the cameras switched views to show Wales sitting on the
thwart at the stern. "He been there this whole time?"

"Hasn't budged 'cept to visit the necess'ry," Aunt Naggie confirmed. "Turned on
the sound a while back to ask if he wanted to come in and sit, but he was
talkin' to himself, an' I figured..." She shrugged. The only other person on
board who talked to themself was her husband, and it was best not to interrupt
him when he did.

Iffy patted Aunt Naggie's shoulder. "I'll take over," she said, reaching past
her to press her thumb against the dark glass square beside the control panel.
After a moment's hesitation it bleeped and blinked green to confirm that the
ship's core acknowledged the transfer of authority from one human to another.
Iffy had scrolled through the core's log many times. It had been almost sixty
years years since it had last been re-set (probably, she suspected, because the
holds had been full of contraband instead of jellyfish). Six watches a day
while at sea, with only a few weeks a year tied up or idle, made for almost a
hundred and twenty five thousand thumb presses and bleeps.

She had read the highlights of the log almost as often as she had read her
nature book. Storms, storms, and more storms as the planet warmed up, some
hurling waves taller than the ship's fully-extended mast to swamp the
*Guinevere*'s decks. Births and deaths and even a shipboard wedding---Aunt
Naggie's parents had invited a dozen friends on board in Rothera to see them
exchange vows. Pirates, twice, and angry notes about dock wardens who wouldn't
stay bribed. "A whale??" followed by "don't be an idiot", repairs laid over
older repairs like layers of barnacles, and then a solitary bookmark near the
log's end next to a note that the sole survivor of a ship lost to a clathrate
blow had been brought on board.

Iffy gave the control panel a protective pat. "I got you," she whispered.

She watched through the cameras as Aunt Naggie trudged back to the cabin she
shared with her husband of twenty years and then stared out at the sea. The
endless light of the Antarctic summer cut sharp reflections into the waves
around her. She toyed with the idea of playing a sim on the ship's core---a sea
monster with tentacles the size of pier posts, or a war-time training drill that
would send her dodging and weaving through flocks of hostile drones---but
instead she sighed and pulled up some homework. Her classroom schooling had
ended when she turned ten. Since then her teachers had been tutoring programs
that she and Aunt Naggie had scrounged, bought, or traded for, each one guarded
by security tough enough to keep out generations of teenagers. If she didn't do
at least a little every day, Aunt Naggie would sigh and look disappointed, and
she'd rather learn long division than face that.

That evening, though, the subject was modern history. Iffy turned the
interaction speed to maximum as the familiar story unfolded. People burned
coal, then oil, then coal again... Forests were cut down or worn to nothing by
drought as the winds shifted... Fish disappeared as pollution took its toll,
replaced by the jellyfish that now choked the seas... She skipped over the
section on how the warming caused the ancient clathrate ice on the ocean floor
to thaw, sending even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in an
ever-accelerating spiral. She knew all she needed to about what giant bubbles
could do to ships unlucky enough to be above them.

She played through half a dozen "what if?" sims, doing worse each time.
Suddenly restless again, she closed her homework, took a deep breath, and tapped
one of the video squares on the control panel. "Hey," she said, her heart in
her throat. "Don't mean to interrupt, but I got some questions if you got
time."

The tiny image of Wales turned its head. "You're not interrupting at all," he
said, speaking directly to the pin-sized camera and microphone set into the
railing beside him. "I'm always happy to talk."

A few moments later he knocked on the pilot house door. "Permission to come
aboard?" he asked, waiting for Iffy to gesture at the stool beside her before
seating himself. He looked around the pilot house appreciatively. "She's
beautiful, isn't she?"

"She's aright," Iffy allowed. "Hull still mends itself if we give it time, an'
th' core's mostly holdin' together. Gotta keep an eye on it, though. We let it
sit too long, it just stops talkin' to us."

Wales nodded. "Probably over-cooled. A lot of people did that to cores when
the war started," he continued in response to Iffy's questioning look. "Someone
started a rumor that the colder the core was, the less likely it was to go
rogue, so everyone cranked their thermostats down as far as they'd go and then
forgot they'd done it. Have you tried putting a twist coil inside the housing
to offset the thermal loss?"

And as easily as that, they slid into a conversation that leaped from laser
guides and the relative merits of fractal carbon versus foamed aluminum for
masts to tricks for keeping a drill press lined up and steady when the building
it was in was shaking. Iffy was just about to ask when that would ever actually
be an issue when he raised a hand to stop her.

"Hang on." His eyes closed as he communed with the satellite passing overhead,
then snapped open.

"We need to change course," he said, surging to his feet. "We need to change
course *now*."

"What's wrong?" Iffy asked, but Wales was already gone. His boots thumped on
the deck as he ran sternward to bang on the door of Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie's
cabin.

"Captain! Captain, please, I need to speak with you!" He waited a second, then
pounded on the door again.

"Uh oh," Iffy muttered, watching on the control panel as the door flew open.

"You better tell me we're sinkin', or I'm puttin' you over the side! I was
*asleep*!" Uncle Jack bellowed.

"We'll be worse than sinking if we don't change course," Wales said, tapping the
tech in his temple. "A ship just glitched out of stealth about thirty kay
behind us. She's still throwing up a lot of dazzle, but she's moving fast, and
she's definitely not here for the jellyfish."

Uncle Jack goggled at him. "Pirates?" he spluttered.

"Only if we're lucky," Wales said grimly. "We need to change course, captain.
If we head straight for shore I can put up a bit of dazzle of my own and try to
keep us away from any drones she sends up."

Uncle Jack swore. "Naggie! Up and movin', woman! We got trouble!"

Iffy had simmed dozens of chases at sea. Sometimes she was the captain of a
customs cutter trying to catch a school of smugglebots. Other times she was in
command of a Zillion catamaran skimming across the water under core-trimmed
sails with a hold full of organic food and subversive software. Some of the
sims ran for hours as she played cat and mouse among the jagged rocks of the
Antarctic shore. She had won more than she had lost, but that was little
comfort now that the game was real.

Wales winced but said nothing as Uncle Jack fired up the coal engine. The
*Guinevere* picked up speed as her propellors churned the sea behind them into a
white froth. Uncle Jack's hands danced across the control panel, telling the
ship's core to tilt the sails past their redline to balance the increased thrust
at the stern. The ship swayed more wildly with each passing minute as she
traded stability for speed.

"Eighteen west, heading one sixty five, at twenty-six kay and change," Wales
called as he ran to the bow to clip a battered black cylinder to the railing.
The ship's control panel wavered and reformed as the gadget powered up and began
spraying misinformation on all frequencies.

"How fast?" Uncle Jack growled. "Tell me how shaddin' fast, man."

"Twenty kay an hour." Wales hesitated. "Make that twenty-two. She's military
for sure."

Uncle Jack horked and spat into the garbage pail by his feet. "Don't mean she
ain't a pirate too. Naggie! Where's my shaddin' tea?"

Iffy stepped out of the doorway so that her foster mother could squeeze past her
and hand a thermos to her husband. She put her arm around Iffy, but the
frightened expression on her face cancelled out whatever reassurance she meant
to give. Jelly fishers didn't have much worth stealing besides their ships, but
those ships were worth a lot---enough for their captains to make a habit of
sailing close by each other whenever strangers were near. And while Iffy didn't
pay any more attention to politics than her homework required, she knew that the
tension between the Zillions and the loose coalition of governors and factory
cores that ruled Antarctica on Australia's behalf had been getting worse.

"Fifth." Wales fished a plastic chip out of his pocket and handed it to Iffy.
"In my cabin, the toolbox with the purple square on the end. Can you get it for
me, please? Tap this near the handle before you open the cabin door."

The cold spray thrown up by their speed stung her face as she ran toward the
stern. She paused for a breath outside Wales' cabin then tapped the plastic
shard on the door handle and waited for a click or a tone or *something*. When
nothing came, she swallowed hard and, half-expecting disaster, yanked the door
open.

The three toolboxes lay side by side beneath Wales' cot. She pulled out the one
marked by a purple square, turned around, and almost screamed at the sight of
Wales' toy bear crouched on all fours in the doorway. Its blue eyes flickered.
She heaved a shaky breath and stepped aside to let it scurry across the floor to
disappear beneath the cot.

Wales had joined her foster parents in the pilot house. "Thank you," he said
when she handed him the toolbox.

"How're we doin'?" she asked.

Wales shook his head. "She hasn't changed course. Either she doesn't know
we've spotted her or she doesn't care."

"Or she's jus' waitin' 'til we're in closer to shore," Uncle Jack growled. "Her
dazzle's spread enough t' cover the both of us if she gets us up against th'
rocks." He swiped two fingers across the control panel in an angry, futile
attempt to squeeze a little more speed out of the *Guinevere*'s struggling
engines.

Wales hefted his toolbox. "I might be able to do something about that. Excuse
me." He squeezed past Iffy and Aunt Naggie.

"You best lend him a hand," Aunt Naggie told Iffy in a low voice. "I'm going to
make some more tea an' put some food together. No sense bein' sunk on an empty
stomach."

"Ain't nobody gonna sink us," Uncle Jack snapped automatically without taking
his eyes off the control panel. Aunt Naggie shooed Iffy out of the pilot house
without replying.

Wales was on one knee near the bow. His open toolbox revealed a collection of
carefully-packed odds and ends that would have made Iffy's mouth water if she
wasn't so afraid. The half-assembled drone in his hands was the same size as
the sentry bot in his room but skinned with some kind of camo that changed color
to match his hands and coat and the deck every time he turned it over.

Using a pair of diamond-tipped tweezers, Wales detached a manipulator as thin as
a drinking straw and placed it carefully back in the toolbox. "To cut the
weight," he explained to Iffy, even though she hadn't asked. "That'll give it
more range."

He removed the drone's other tiny arm and stowed it beside its twin, then handed
the drone to Iffy. "Probably best if you don't tell your uncle about this
part," he said quietly as he used the nail of his left thumb to peel the false
skin back from the pad of his right forefinger. Underneath lay a small patch of
silver whose lights blinked in time with the larger square set in his temple.

Iffy gasped. "Are you trans?"

Wales glanced at her, a wry smile on his face. "You know, that used to mean
something very different than it does now. But no, I'm not transhuman. I just
don't like advertising how much tech I have in me. It's hard enough having
people try to take my head off every once in a while---if I had to worry about
waking up minus a finger or two I'd never get any sleep."

He turned his gaze back to his toolbox and pressed his silver fingertip against
the side of the toolbox. "Sixteen... orange... kneecap," he said quietly.

Iffy held her breath, half-expecting the toolbox to transform itself
into---well, she didn't know what, but *something*. Instead, a tiny blue light
blinked twice in the handle.

Wales took a deep breath and lifted the inside out of the toolbox to reveal a
shallow compartment in the bottom. Nestled among the bits and pieces of tech
hidden there lay half a dozen small cylinders, each one the size and shape of
the last joint on Iffy's little finger. Four empty holes showed where others
had once been. Using his tweezers once again, Wales carefully plucked one of
the cylinders from its resting place and inserted it into the base of the drone.

"'Zat th' batt'ry?" Iff guessed.

Wales shook his head. "Its battery is built in. This is... This is just in
case." He reassembled the bottom of the toolbox and tossed the drone into the
air.

It rose, started to fall, and then---Iffy blinked. She couldn't see any rotors
or hear any buzzing or whining. The drone just *floated*, its sides shimmering
slightly as if it were a hologram.

"It's covered in ionizing impellers," Wales explained before Iffy could ask.
"They were designed for use in ultra-thin atmospheres, like Mars, but they work
in ours too."

A hundred questions crowded together in Iffy's head. Before she could ask any
of them, he pointed his silver-tipped finger toward the horizon. With no more
command than that, the drone shot away, disappearing from sight as its camo
matched the blue, gray, and white of the sky, sea, and waves.

Wales locked his toolbox and stood up, folding the little flap of false skin
back in place over his fingertip. "Let's watch from inside."

Uncle Jack was chewing the end of his beard as they entered the pilot house.
"Well?" he demanded.

Instead of answering, Wales pressed his palm against the nearest corner of the
control panel. The images from the ship's cameras slid aside to make room for a
larger one.

Seen from on high through a fisheye lens, the ocean looked like a gray sheet of
plastic litter. The irregular lines running diagonally across it were wave
crests, and the speck near the bottom was the *Guinevere*. There was a whole
lot of nothing around them, Iffy realized with a chill.

"Have you sent a distress call?" Wales asked quietly.

Uncle Jack scowled. "Nearest shout I got back is a hundred kay east, but
they're smaller'n we are an' too scared to fight. Halley wasn't much interested
'til I told them our friends looked military. Then they made noises about
looking into it and dropped off comms. And then the shaddin' *comms* dropped
out." He jabbed a finger at a small image in the corner of the control panel
that was blinking an orange warning. Whoever was hunting them was blocking
their transmissions. They were on their own.

"All right, let's get a good look at you," Wales said under his breath. He slid
his hand across the control panel again. The scene shifted as the drone tilted
its camera forward and narrowed its focus to zoom in on a dark blur that
squatted on the ocean below like a cockroach on a dirty floor. Its outline
remained blurry even as it grew larger. That was its camo, Iffy
guessed---thousands of micro-thin strips of smart material absorbing and
re-emitting light, infrared, radar, and everything else that might give reveal
the ship's actual position and profile. The flurries of multi-colored speckles
that swept across the image every few seconds were the camo's electronic
counterpart at work, doing for the intruder what she hoped Wales' gear was doing
for the *Guinevere*.

Even blurred, the ship was a frightening sight, long and lean and four times the
*Guinevere*'s size, the narrow V of her wake betraying the power of her engines.

"Saints and their mercies!" Aunt Naggie exclaimed from behind Iffy, a tray of
tea mugs in her arms. "That's the bloody *Taroona*!"

As if in answer, a splash of text began scrolling next to the image.
*Glenunga*-class combat transport... active keel... modified infrared
profile... modified camouflage... The words solidified into a spider-web of
fact and guess and supposition as the *Guinevere*'s core tried to make sense of
what it was seeing.

Iffy opened her mouth to ask Wales if the Australian pirates were chasing him or
the gear in his toolboxes, then shut it. Now wasn't the time, especially not
with Uncle Jack there.

"How fast can that thing of yours move?" Uncle Jack asked as the ship swelled
on the screen.

"Mach three and change," Wales replied. "Hang on."

The image tilted and swooped as the drone dove toward the sea below, levelling
off at the last moment to skim the tops of the waves. A trio of graphs appeared
at the top of the control panel. Wales cursed under his breath.

"What now?" Uncle Jack demanded.

"Some kind multipath radar rig," Wales muttered. "They sure as hell didn't have
it three days ago."

"Is that bad?" Iffy asked anxiously.

"It means they can tell something's out there, but they can't have a lock on it.
I hope," Wales amended grimly. "But look---there she is, the pride of the
Tasmanian fleet." The *Taroona*'s outline suddenly came into focus as the drone
came close enough for its tiny brain to see through their pursuer's dazzle.

"Murder in high heels is what she is," Uncle Jack growled. The stubby frames of
railguns bristled at her bow and stern. The large tube amidships had to be some
sort of EM pulse cannon, Iffy guessed---at least, that's what it would be if
this was a story sim. But the most frightening thing was what *wasn't* there:
no flag, no call numbers, nothing to give her any sort of identity. Not even
her name, so defiantly displayed when she was tied up in Halley. She was
hunting now, not swaggering.

Without warning the display went blank. "What the---" Uncle Jack swore as the
image re-formed.

"Laser burst," Wales said curtly. "The drone's core is shielded, but another
hit like that will fry the ionizers. No way they did that from so far
out---they've got a boat in the water or something in the air I can't spot. I'm
going to pull back." Even as he spoke, the ship dwindled into the distance.

"Dammit!" Uncle Jack slapped the controls in frustration. "There's no way we
can outrun them."

Wales drummed his fingers on the control panel. "Maybe we don't have too." A
second image blossomed on the control panel aswirl with false-colored oranges
and pinks. In the seconds it took Iffy to recognize the coastline in front of
them, a pair of circled dots blinked into life.

Wales pointed at a splotch of pink that lay between the two dots.
"There---there's a ridge about two hundred meters down. Seismology detected a
mudslide this morning, and there's been bubbling since." He glanced at the
*Guinevere*'s captain. "It's a sea boil waiting to happen," he translated. "If
it blows, it'll slow her down or scare her off."

"'If' don't help us," Uncle Jack spat.

"Leave that to me," Wales said. Thin white lines appeared and disappeared on
the display as he and the *Guinevere*'s core explored a thousand possible
futures. After a couple of seconds, their criss-cross confusion locked into
place. Wales tapped the image. "That's our best chance. Head for these
coordinates. I'll update them as I get more data from the drone."

"Never thought I'd be steerin' *into* a boil," Uncle Jack grumbled as he bent
the *Guinevere*'s path to port. He grabbed a sandwich from Aunt Naggie's tray
and gobbled half in a single hasty bite, chasing it down with a gulp of tea and
a belch. Wales took a second ceramic mug and sipped its contents.

Aunt Naggie reached over Iffy to take the third and handed it to her niece.
"I'll be down in the galley," she said.

Uncle Jack eyed Iffy, clearly expecting her to follow her aunt, but said nothing
when she stayed. Her tea suddenly tasted metallic in her mouth. It took her a
moment to realize that it was blood, and that she had bitten her lip. Her heart
was pounding. This wasn't a sim. This wasn't anything like a sim. This was
terrifying.

Beside her, Wales grunted. "She's turning faster than I expected. I'll update
the model." The white lines on the screen danced and twisted again, settling
quickly back into a pattern indistinguishable to Iffy's eyes from the original.

Wales grunted again. "Four minutes to optimal position. Assuming they're not
skewing the sat nav to throw us off track."

Soft green digits in the corner of the control panel counted down the seconds.
The tension in the pilot house stretched until Iffy thought it would snap like a
rubber band. Uncle Jack's knuckles were white on the wheel, and she couldn't
quite seem to catch her breath. Even Wales seemed to feel it. He flew the
drone in a back-and-forth sweep as if searching for something, never too far in
front of the Aussie warship but never letting it close in enough to try another
shot with its laser.

Three minutes. Two. One. "Show time," Wales said quietly. He bowed his head
as if in prayer. The image on the screen steadied as the drone slowed and
stopped. The Aussie ship drew closer, gray and single-purposed like the shark
in Iffy's nature book.

The map on the control panel tilted to show depth. The ridge on the sea floor
lay directly beneath the drone, orange splashed with warning pink. "Ten
seconds," Wales said. Before Iffy could ask, "Until what?" the drone dove
straight down into the water.

The image from its cameras dimmed and went black as the drone left the light
behind. Two white sparks appeared on the map next to *Taroona* and sped toward
the blue dot that marked the drone's position. "*Ta ma d√©*," Wales swore.

His drone plummeted toward the sea floor as the *Taroona*'s torpedoes closed in,
finally able to get a lock on their target from its trail in the water. "C'mon
c'mon c'mon," Iffy pleaded, not realizing she was speaking aloud.

The drone's dot blinked out. A balloon of red light expanded where it had been.
The white sparks tried to curve away, but there wasn't time. Their trajectories
disappeared as they intersected the expanding red blob.

And then the blob touched the sea floor. The pink blotch beneath it writhed
like a speared fish, darkening and spreading as if it was being dragged along.
Graphs flashed onto the screen, probability surfaces dancing in three dimensions
as the *Guinevere*'s core tried to predict what would happen next.

"Uh oh," Wales said softly. On the screen, a section of the sea ridge had
started sliding slowly into the depths. Blue lightning flashed along the edges
of the mudslide, bright lines connecting and spreading in a sudden spiderweb
fracture.

"Come about," Wales snapped at Uncle Jack. "Now!"

The *Guinevere*'s captain didn't need to be told twice. "I told you this was a
stupid idea!" he snarled as he spun the wheel.

Iffy grabbed the door frame to keep her feet. "What happened?" she asked.

"Fault line in the ridge," Wales said angrily. "The satellite couldn't see it,
and it wasn't in the survey data. The last bot to scan that area must have---"
He stopped himself and pressed a hand onto the control panel. The map and
graphs vanished, replaced by a grainy image that quickly zoomed in to show the
now-familiar outline of the *Taroona*. "Hang on!" he ordered as the sea behind
them started to bubble.

Iffy couldn't look away. The mudslide started by the bomb that the drone had
been carrying had broken up a field of barely-frozen clathrate ice, releasing
enormous bubbles of methane. As they rose to the surface they churned the sea
into a froth unable to bear the weight of a ship.

Too late, the *Taroona* realized the danger beneath her. She turned sharply,
trying to steer for safety. Her stern dipped, throwing her bow into the air.
Suddenly clumsy, she tipped on her side and slid down into the dark unforgiving
ocean.

"Saints and their mercies," Uncle Jack said quietly.

But no---there she was, still afloat! She wasn't a jelly dredger or a cargo
hauler. She had been built to withstand gunfire and scalpel mines and the
storms of the great southern ocean. She bobbed and wallowed like an oversized
bath toy, her deadly grace gone, but as the water that had tried to claim her
sluiced off her sides, she turned toward the *Guinevere*. Twin jets of white
steam spurted from her stern as her engines briefly lifted above the waves, and
then the *Taroona* surged forward once again.

"Crap," Wales said under his breath.

Uncle Jack said something louder and much worse. "I knew you were trouble," he
snarled at Wales as he reached for the control panel.

Wales caught his wrist. "What are you doing?"

"Cutting the affin' engines!" Uncle Jack yanked his arm free, his face as red
as Iffy had ever seen it. "You can't sink 'em and we can't outrun 'em so the
only thing we got left is to run up the white affin' flag and hope you're all
they take! And if you ever lay hands to me again on *my* ship, I'll---"

*BOOM!* Without warning, yellow-red flame jetted from the *Taroona*'s side.
Iffy shrieked as a second barely-seen streak hit the Aussie ship, then a third,
these two just above the waterline as the *Taroona* heeled sideways under the
force of the blows. Something exploded inside the ship, kicking her sideways
like a child's toy.

"Ya killed 'em," Iffy whispered unbelievingly as the fearsome raider broke in
two. She dragged her sleeve across her face. "Ya killed 'em all. Why'd ya do
that?"

"That wasn't me!" Wales' hands danced across the control panel. "Damn it! I
need to get another drone up there."

"No you don't," Uncle Jack said flatly, pointing out the window.

Five hundred meters away, a ship had appeared out of nowhere, its camo briefly
disrupted by the missiles it had launched. Where the *Taroona* and the
*Guinevere* were metal, the newcomer was made of tweaked bamboo. Her dozen
sails were a tangle of fractal geometry too complex to be managed or even really
understood by a merely human mind. Her green and yellow pennant with the slogan
*Este mundo √© de deus* proclaimed to all who she was, while her railguns and
missile racks said just as plainly what she had been built for: war.

"Zillions..." Iffy whispered. Everyone knew the words on that flag---knew them
and feared them. Brazil had fought beside the rest of humanity when the
machines rebelled, but had turned on their allies once the bots were defeated.
"*Este mundo!*" they screamed in sim after sim, always scheming, always the
villains. "This world is God's!" The earth's self-appointed defenders would
sacrifice everything to undo the damage humanity had done to the Earth. When a
shaft in a coal mine collapsed people blamed Zillion saboteurs intent on driving
the world back into the stone age. When a mutant fungus turned the contents of
a greenhouse into sludge, all its owner had to do was say, "It must have been
them!" for people to demand that the governors *do* something. And when a
Zillion trader was brave enough or stupid enough to go more than a block or two
from Halley's market and woke up in hospital, everyone just nodded
straight-faced at the Marines' equally straight-faced apologies for the
inexplicable glitch in their drones' recording that left them unable to identify
anyone who might have been involved.

Even as they watched, the Zillion ship blurred and vanished as its camo
reformed. The faint spiderweb tracery of her rigging glinted in the sun, then
it too was gone. "Why'd they---" Iffy felt lightheaded. "Why'd they kill 'em
all like that?"

"Because they could," Wales replied wearily. "There's no way they could get
past the *Taroona*'s defenses when she was running at spec, but knocked off
balance the way she was..." He shrugged. "They saw a shot---they took it."

"A shot *you* gave 'em," Uncle Jack said accusingly, quick as always to make
sure trouble was someone else's fault. "There's gonna be hell to pay for this."
He slapped at the control panel to put the *Guinevere* in a tight turn.

"Wait---no! We can't go back for them." Wales reached for the panel.

Uncle Jack slapped his hand away. "I'm not leavin' 'em in the affin' water!"

Wales shook his head. "It's too late. Look." There, on the panel in front of
them, another pink blotch was rising from the ocean floor. It churned and
reformed as the *Guinevere*'s simple-minded sonar tried and failed to make sense
of a maelstrom of bubbles, and then it reached the surface and the broken
remains of the *Taroona* disappeared.

Uncle Jack swore again, and for a moment Iffy thought he was going to hit Wales.
Instead, he swiped his hand across the control panel to turn them back toward
Rothera.

All of a sudden Iffy needed to be somewhere else---anywhere else. She threw
open the door of the pilot house and stumbled out into the endless hard light of
the southern summer. Her feet took her to the galley on auto-pilot. She pulled
open the hatch and fell into her foster mother's arms. Aunt Naggie wrapped her
meaty arms around her adopted daughter. "Sweetie, what's wrong?"

"They're dead," Iffy cried. "They're all sunk an' dead!"

"Oh, sweetie." Aunt Naggie hugged her tight, rocking her from side to side.
"Oh, sweetie..." For a moment Iffy thought she heard another voice saying, "I
love you so much," but then there were just her sobs and the hum of the engines
and the muffled sound of the uncaring sea.

## Chapter 4

Her tears eventually stopped, as tears always do. After one last hug, Iffy left
Aunt Naggie in the galley and sat on the thwart at the *Guinevere*'s stern, gray
thoughts chasing each other aimlessly in her head. She half-hoped that Wales
would sit with her so that she would have someone to be angry at, but instead,
he disappeared into his cabin, ignoring Uncle Jack's angry questions about what
the hell a civilian was doing with a bomb in his affin' luggage. *Wait 'til you
find out about the other ones,* she thought dully.

Sunk in misery, it took her a moment to realize that something was moving above
the horizon. She stood and shaded her eyes, squinting against the dazzle from
the waves until she was sure she was seeing the wispy smudge of a spotter
drone's gossamer wings. Why was it approaching from the west? Halley lay east
of them. Unless--- "Uncle Jack!" she shouted, sprinting toward the pilot house.
"Uncle Jack, it's the Zillions! They're comin' back for us!"

"Hang on a sec," her uncle said to a face on to the control panel as she charged
in. "What?"

"Uncle Jack," she panted. "There's a Zillion spotter comin' in!"

"That ain't Zillion," her uncle said scornfully. "It's outta Rothera." He
jerked his thumb at the face on the screen. "Lady here says they been lookin'
for us. Or leastways, they been lookin' for our passenger. Seems he's quite a
popular fellow."

Iffy looked from her uncle to the screen. An old woman smiled back warmly. Her
brown face was lined with a century of wrinkles, and what was left of her hair
was plastered against her scalp in a style that Iffy had only ever seen in
homework for her history class. "Hello," the face said. "You must be Miz Kwan.
I'm Doctor Johel. I'm looking forward to meeting you."

They reached Rothera two days later. The spotter traced lazy circles above them
the whole way, its insect-eye cameras and microscopic core searching ceaselessly
for signs of more trouble. "Shame it's not a bit bigger," Uncle Jack grunted.

"That's trouble we don't need," Aunt Naggie responded. Skies the world over had
been off limits since the end of the war---China-over-the-Sea didn't have enough
satellites to watch everything all the time, but anything bigger much larger
than a single person ran the risk of being fried. A few heavily armored
aircraft still flew short missions here and there, or so the stories Iffy had
found in the jungle claimed, but for most of humanity, flight had once more
become the stuff of daydreams.

Each time Wales emerged from his cabin for a few minutes to get some tea or use
the toilet, the gossamer-winged drone drifted closer to the *Guinevere* like a
gull that had spotted someone eating a sandwich. Wales paid no attention to it,
and little more to Iffy and her foster parents. "Good morning", "excuse me",
and "no thank you" were all he seemed to have the energy to say.

They threaded their way through the narrow passage between Adelaide Island and
the Antarctic Peninsula, past mats of tweaked seaweed left over from someone's
failed attempt to start a sea farm, and there it was: Rothera. The capital of
Australia's Antarctic territory was ten times the size of Halley, home port for
the fleet that glared across the Drake Passage at the southernmost tip of South
America and the Zillion marauders who called it home.

A pair of sleek sentry drones surfaced beside them as they rounded the rocky
point where the scavenged remains of the original research station stood.
Normally bustling with warships, freighters, jelly dredgers, tugs, and water
taxis, Rothera's harbor seemed unnaturally quiet. "Governor's orders," Aunt
Naggie told Iffy, passing her a hard-boiled egg liberally dusted with curry
powder. "That's what Jack says---everyone's been told to stay outta the way
'til we tie up. Seems we scared 'em," she added bleakly.

Her meager lunch inside her, Iffy went back on deck. She was surprised to see
Wales leaning on the railing, his eyes as distant as his thoughts. Iffy thought
for a moment about all the people she wished she had made friends with over the
years, then stepped up to the railing a meter away from him and leaned on it as
well.

He looked sideways at her. "I'm sorry for what happened."

"No worries," she said. Together, they watched the shore approach.

"You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy," Wales sighed.

Iffy bridled. "It ain't that bad."

Wales chuckled. "It's a quote from an old movie---kind of like a sim. And no,
it isn't that bad." His half-smile slipped slightly. "Or at least, it didn't
used to be."

Thin trails of smoke drew diagonal charcoal lines across the sky above the city
as the *Guinevere* approached. Iffy glanced at Wales, but he showed no emotion
at the evidence of carbon being thrown into the atmosphere. The Peninsula's
coal mines were the original source of Rothera's wealth, the reason both for the
governor being there and for the Zillions' prowling and raids. It was a crime
to burn fossil fuel in most parts of the world, including Australia, but when
pressed about their seemingly endless exemptions, Rothera's citizens shrugged
and said, "Damage done," or pointed out that the whole of Antarctica would still
be covered in ice if it weren't for the warming. And if cities elsewhere had
drowned and billions had starved or been driven from their homes in the years
before the machine wars, well, that damage was done too.

The wind shifted suddenly, and the city's smell hit Iffy like a wet hammer.
Rothera didn't just have coal mines---its dredging fleet was ten times the size
of Halley's. The reek of tonnes of jellyfish being rendered down for fuel and
fertilizer was like a blow to the head. Wales wrinkled his nose in disgust, but
Iffy took a deep breath, held it until she thought her lungs might burst, and
let it out in a whoosh. That stink meant Rothera, and Rothera meant Honesty,
and Honesty meant---well, Iffy was still trying to work exactly what her friend
meant to her and vice versa.

The sentry drones peeled away as they entered the harbor to resume their endless
patrol. The spotter flying overhead banked and turned back out to sea a few
moments later, the sun sparkling off the solar cells in its wings. Iffy watched
it go, wondering what it would be like to watch everything below with the
detachment of an angel or a satellite. She was pretty sure there wouldn't be
much detachment once they docked.

Sure enough, a squad of Marines was waiting for them on their assigned pier.
Four stood in a half-circle around a tiny figure dressed all in black with an
armored bot the size of the *Guinevere*'s pilot house behind them. Someone had
turned the "0" of the "G-80" stencilled on the bot's side into a scowling face.

The rest of the Marines were scattered among crates and machines or on the decks
of nearby ships, their positions chosen after a millisecond of high-intensity
simulation by the city's core. Other than them, the pier was deserted. So were
the piers on either side, Iffy realized.

"Sharks in the water," Wales murmured beside her as a dark mechanical shape swam
beneath them. "And that G-80 on the pier isn't just for show. See its treads?"
He nodded almost imperceptibly toward the hulking bot. "They've been reinforced
for urban work." He glanced past Iffy as Aunt Naggie came on deck. Aunt Naggie
put her arm around Iffy's shoulders and gave her foster daughter a wordless
squeeze of reassurance.

The *Guinevere* slowed and turned parallel to the pier. Iffy shrugged off her
aunt's arm and hurried forward to throw a line to a waiting Marine. As he
caught it, another Marine leaped across the gap to the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Despite the weight of his exoskeleton, his boots made no more sound hitting the
deck than a seagull flapping its wings. When he turned to toss the coiled line
waiting there to one of his companions, Iffy saw the stubby bulk of a rifle
tucked into the angular framework that gave him the strength of five men and a
speed nearly equal to a bot's.

Uncle Jack strode onto the deck and put his hands on his hips. "Well," he said
to no one in particular. "Let's get this over with." With one final glare at
Wales, he let the gangplank fall onto the pier with a thud and stumped down to
meet their welcoming committee.

Wales stepped aside to let Aunt Naggie follow her husband then picked up the
toolbox with the purple square on the end. "How about you bring those?" he said
to Iffy, nodding at the two remaining toolboxes. "And stay close---as long as
we don't startle anyone, everything will be fine."

Iffy hesitated. "It's normal for an apprentice to carry their teacher's gear,"
Wales explained gently. Iffy nodded jerkily and followed him down the gangplank
with one box in each hand.

Doctor Johel stepped forward to greet them. "Mister Wales," she said warmly,
extending her hand. "Such a pleasure to see you again." Her clipped accent was
straight out of an old story sim, and her eyes actually sparkled as she and
Wales shook hands.

"And you, doctor." Wales bowed his head slightly before releasing her hand.
"My apologies again for the commotion I caused."

"No apology necessary," Doctor Johel said briskly. "Pirates are pirates no
matter who's flag they fly, and it's useful to know that the Brazilians are able
to get that close without being detected."

Wales inclined his head again. "As you say." He hesitated. "Do you know yet
how many were lost?"

The tiny woman's expression didn't soften. "I'm afraid we don't. And even if
we did, Intelligence might not share that information."

"And Miz Kwan," she continued smoothly, turning to Iffy and holding out her hand
again. "A pleasure to meet you in person. I'm grateful to you for helping
Mister Wales get here in one piece."

"No worries," Iffy mumbled, setting down the toolboxes and shaking Doctor
Johel's hand gingerly. The old woman was half a head shorter than Iffy, and her
wrinkled brown skin felt like warm plastic. Up close, the sparkle in her eyes
was more than just a trick of the light, but Iffy couldn't tell if she was
tweaked or if the gleaming motes were some kind of tech.

"And I'm Jack Ng, thank you for asking," Uncle Jack broke in, stepping forward
and thrusting his hand out. "I'm the captain of the *Guinevere*, and what I
want to know is, who's payin' me?"

"I'm sure the governor will take care of that when you see him," Doctor Johel
said, pointedly ignoring his hand.

"When I what? I'm not---will you stop pestering me, woman?" He shrugged Aunt
Naggie's cautioning hand off his arm angrily. "I'm not talkin' to th' governor!
I was hired for a job, plain an' simple. I just want paid an' then I'm done
with it."

"That will be for the governor to decide," Doctor Johel said with sudden steel
in her voice. "Luckily, he was able to make time in his schedule for you." She
turned and began to hobble toward shore. As she did, the armored bot behind her
pivoted smoothly and almost silently on its heavy treads and lowered one of its
arms. The elderly doctor sat on it as if were a park bench---as if being
carried gently along a pier by a century-old machine designed for lethal mayhem
was the most natural thing in the world.

"Show-off," Uncle Jack grumbled. "Treatin' that thing like it's some kind o'
pet rat."

"Actually, I think she trained its core on a sim of a guard dog she once had,"
Wales said drily. He picked up his toolbox and nudged Iffy with his elbow.
"Come along, my young apprentice. Our day's not over yet."

Half a dozen people stood waiting at the base of the pier under the watchful
eyes of another squad of Marines. Iffy recognized some of them as crew from the
ships tied up on either side of the *Guinevere*'s berth. Iffy's cheeks burned
under their curious, resentful stares. One nodded to Uncle Jack, who grunted in
return, but no one said hello.

They followed Doctor Johel and the G-80 to the harbor gate, where a bus painted
the same navy blue as the Marines' uniforms waited for them. The G-80 stood
motionless as Doctor Johel got to her feet, then spun around to stand beside it.
"After you," she said, gesturing at the bus's open door. Wales inclined his
head once again and climbed aboard with Iffy, Uncle Jack, and Aunt Naggie behind
him.

"I haven't been in one of these in years," Wales said, seating himself near the
front with his toolbox at his feet.

"I ain't never been in one," Iffy confessed as she sat on the other side of the
aisle from him. "They must think pretty highly o' you to lay on such a fuss."

Wales laughed humorlessly and nudged his toolbox with his boot. "I suspect that
what they think highly of is this. And if they thought they could take it away
from me without, um, consequences, I'm pretty sure our welcome would have been
much less friendly." He raised an eyebrow at Doctor Johel. The old woman
smiled sweetly from the seat in front of him but said nothing.

Rothera bustled around them once the bus left the dock behind. They hummed
quietly through the city streets and up the long, gentle slope that led to the
governor's mansion. The G-80 stayed five meters in front of them, its twin
turrets swivelling each time they went through an intersection. The Marines
jogged along on either side with long mechanical strides. Traffic pulled aside
to let them pass, but Iffy didn't see any of the mad scramble that a convoy like
theirs would cause in Halley. Her heart skipped a beat once when she thought
she saw a particular face in the crowd, but then the girl turned her head and
she realized it was someone else.

As they drew closer to the governor's mansion, the three-story cinderblock
buildings build to house refugees after the war gave way to newer, brighter
construction. Foamed glass reflected the blue sky and the tall anti-aircraft
laser towers that surrounded the mansion. Iffy pressed her face against the bus
window and stared hungrily at the greenhouses nestled among the turrets' feet.
Mangoes and oranges and flowers---flowers!---made a green riot beneath the
sheltering panels. Little Mrs. Sandhu claimed that the governor even grew
bananas, though Big Mrs. Sandhu scoffed at the notion. "They been 'stinct
longer than we been alive," she said in a tone that brooked no argument.

Iffy's stomach suddenly rumbled. Doctor Johel smiled at her. "I'm sure lunch
will be served," she promised.

"Thanks," Iffy mumbled, feeling her foster father's glare on her back. Suddenly
resentful of his disapproval, she asked, "So what kind o' doctor are you?"

"The medical kind, originally," the old woman replied, turning in her seat so
that she was fully facing Iffy. "But I've been focusing physics and engineering
for the last few years. There's still a lot of technology left over from the
machine wars that we don't quite understand, and it's my department's job to
secure it. Or destroy it if that's not possible," she continued, raising her
eyebrows at Wales. He smiled as if Doctor Johel had paid him a compliment.
They rode the rest of the way in silence.

A tall wrought iron fence surrounded the governor's mansion. Sleek robotic
sentries paced back and forth behind it, their blunt conical heads swivelling to
track the approaching vehicles.

The G-80 pulled to the side to let the bus go through its single gate, but the
Marines stayed beside them right up to the turnaround in front of the mansion's
main doors. A triangular diamond wedge glistened in the center of the gravel
circle, familiar to Iffy from dozens of pictures. "In memory" was engraved on
each of its faces. In memory of those lost when the ice melted and the sea
rose. In memory of those who fell fighting the machines in the war that
followed. In memory of all the species now extinct, the giraffes and tigers and
all the others that now existed only in books and sims. Iffy paused a moment as
she came out of the bus to look at it, a sudden ache in her chest as she
wondered if someone, somewhere, was grieving for the sailors who had been on the
*Taroona*.

"Get along with you," Uncle Jack growled, nudging her none too gently. Flanked
by Marines, they followed Doctor Johel through the mansion's doors.

And then waited. Iffy wasn't sure what she had been expecting, but sitting on a
comfortable couch with potted plants on either side of them and soft music
playing in the background wasn't it. Uncle Jack kept his arms crossed and
muttered to himself incessantly, glaring at Aunt Naggie when she ventured that
the governor must be very busy, really, it wasn't surprising that he couldn't
see them right away, and she was sure he wouldn't be much longer.

Wales didn't seem bothered by the wait. At one point Iffy thought he had
actually fallen asleep, but then he grimaced and opened his eyes. "They're
locked down tight," he sighed quietly, tapping the tech in his temple with a
finger.

Iffy nodded toward the toolboxes on the floor between them. "Least they let you
keep your gear."

Wales smiled. "There is that," he agreed. "And---ah, here we go." He stood
and brushed his hands on his trousers as the door across from them swung open
with soft pneumatic whoosh. It and the wall were as thick as Iffy's slab
mattress. Armor? Soundproofing? She didn't have time to wonder before Doctor
Johel beckoned them to join her. "The governor will see you now," she said.
"But I'm afraid you'll have to leave those here."

"Of course," Wales said smoothly, nudging his toolbox under the bench with his
boot. "Shall we say...half an hour?"

"I should think that would be adequate," Doctor Johel replied. She stepped to
the side and beckoned them through.

"Half an hour 'til what?" Iffy whispered to Wales.

"Until they decide I'm not coming back and make a fuss about it," he whispered
back, but then he grinned at her widened eyes and she didn't know if he was
kidding or not.

The windowless office Doctor Johel showed them into was not much smaller than
the room they had been waiting in. Framed photographs on the walls traced the
history of Rothera from its early days as a research station through the opening
of the mines and its years as a work camp for people that the revolutionary
government in far-off London didn't want at home but didn't want to get rid
of---at least, not yet. The largest picture was of the flag being raised in
Hobart after the government was driven out by the machines. A smaller one
beneath it showed what was left of London, drowned and abandoned.

A plain wooden desk stood near one wall with half a dozen simple wooden chairs
in front of it. A single Marine with a shaved head gestured for them all to sit
and then studied them for a heartbeat before saying, "All clear, sir."

"Thank you, sergeant." The words seemed to come out of thin air. Iffy's jaw
dropped as the air behind the desk shimmered to reveal a tall man in a formal
dark turtleneck, slightly stooped with age but still strong, his face exactly
like the image that hung in the Sandhu's grocery store.

"As you were," Governor Stern said pleasantly, waving Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie
back into their seats as they started to rise. He nodded at Doctor Johel sat
somewhat stiffly behind his desk, and steepled his fingers. "Thank you for
coming. I trust your trip here from the docks was less eventful than your
encounter with our Brazilian neighbors?"

The room was silent as everyone waited for Wales to reply. When it became clear
he wasn't going to, Uncle Jack cleared his throat. "Er, yes, your honor, clear
skies 'n' smooth sailin'." He bobbed his head. "Glad t' help. Happy to, any
time you need."

The governor nodded his head gravely. "Thank you, Captain Ng. The government
appreciates your service. And you, Mister Wales," he continued, looking
directly at Wales for the first time. "Will you be happy to help too?"

Wales never got to answer. Something screamed outside, a shrill mechanical
sound that ended in the flat crack of an explosion. A dozen pop-up displays
instantly materialized above the desk, aerial views and schematics splashed with
red danger markers. The Marine took two steps forward and pressed the barrel of
the gun that was suddenly in her hand against Wales' head. He raised his hands,
saying, "It's not mine! It's not mine!" as half a dozen Marines poured through
the door behind them.

"Sir, it's the G-80," the one in the lead said, urgent but calm. "It---" A
second shriek and *crack!* cut off the rest of his sentence. "You need to
evacuate, sir," the Marine continued as a section of the wall behind the
governor's desk slid sideways to reveal a ramp leading down into the bedrock
below the mansion.

The governor stayed where he was. A single swipe of his hand enlarged a
top-down display of the front of the mansion just in time to show Doctor Johel's
mechanical pet fire another micro-missile at the swarm of four-legged robotic
sentries swarming around it. Shriek---*crack!* The explosion threw a shattered
sentry twenty meters. The G-80 pivoted on its treads and swung one of its arms
like a club to knock another sentry into the air.

"Doctor?" the governor asked calmly. "You told me its core was secure."

"It was," she replied, her voice icy instead of calm. "Mister Wales?"

"This has nothing to do with me," Wales replied, his hands still in the air and
his head tilted slightly under the pressure of the Marine's gun against the tech
in his temple.

"Sir---" the Marine began again.

"In a moment," the governor said sharply. A pair of sentries charged their
larger opponent simultaneously. The G-80 knocked the first one away and grabbed
the second with its heavy square claws.

The image flashed blue for a moment. "EMP?" Doctor Johel gasped disbelievingly.
"It doesn't have a pulse generator!"

The image reformed. The G-80 dropped the sentry it had caught. The other
sentry bots stood frozen in a circle around it for a moment. Then, as one, the
G-80 and the sentries turned toward the mansion. The last thing Iffy saw before
her aunt dragged her away was the sentries leaping through the hole left by the
G-80 plowing through the mansion's front door.

"Breach!" one of the younger Marines shouted.

"Really?" Wales muttered sarcastically, his hands still in the air.

The Marine holding the gun to his head nudged him toward the opening behind the
governor's desk. "Sir, if you would?"

Wales didn't move. "Not without those toolboxes."

This time the Marine's nudge was more of a shove. "Sir, we can come back
for---"

"If it takes more than twenty-two minutes for us to come back, there won't be
anything for us to come back to," Wales said sharply, his feet planted.
"Doctor?"

Doctor Johel and the governor exchanged looks. "Get them," the governor ordered
crisply.

"Sir, we can't bring his tech into the secure area without testing it," the
sergeant protested.

"Mister Wales?" The governor raised an eyebrow.

"Safe as houses," Wales promised. "You have my word."

After that, everything moved quickly. One Marine opened the door and tossed a
thumb-sized camera drone into the waiting room. When it wasn't fried by a laser
or blown to pieces by a needle gun, a second Marine bent low in a starter's
crouch, took a deep breath, and flung himself through the door. Something
sizzled across the shoulder of his exoskeleton a millisecond before he crashed
into the couch that Iffy had been sitting on just a few minutes earlier. He
rolled over clumsily. "Left scapular is bacon," he called. Iffy had only a
heartbeat to wonder why why he said "bacon" instead of "baked" before he flung
the first of the toolboxes she had been carrying back through the door.

His partner caught it and set it down just in time to catch the second one.
"Wait!" Wales ordered as the Marine in the waiting room reached for the third
toolbox. He closed his eyes for a moment and then nodded. "Now!"

The third toolbox flew through the air. The Marine who had thrown it crouched,
took a deep breath, and threw himself after it.

Whatever had shot him the first time had been patient, and now its patience was
rewarded. A perfectly straight line of blue light flashed just long enough to
leave an after-image on Iffy's eyes. The Marine landed in a crumpled heap on
the floor of the governor's office. His exoskeleton tried to stand, its
programming still trying to anticipate its wearer's likely moves, but it
couldn't lift the dead weight it now held.

"Oh saints," Aunt Naggie whispered.

The Marine who had caught the toolboxes didn't hesitate---didn't even really
seem to notice how her partner didn't move as she pulled his battery and two
clips of ammunition from his body. *It's his conditioning,* Iffy thought.
*Like Jeep when he came back. He just don't feel it.* She swallowed hard to
stop herself from throwing up.

The Marines herded everyone down the stairs behind the governor's desk into a
narrow zig-zag corridor that smelled of sweat and machinery. Pipes ran along
the ceiling, a color-coded mix of water, sewage, secure optical cabling, and
highways for the rat-sized repair bots that were now scurrying madly to the
mansion's defense.

"Any theories, doctor?" the governor asked from the head of the little
procession.

"No idea," Doctor Johel puffed, struggling to keep the pace. "Nobody
ever... managed... to breach the firewalls... on the G-80s... during the war.
And if someone... has a way... to infect... the sentries..."

"It was optical," Wales cut in. "That flash. It wasn't an EMP. It was some
kind of machine hypnosis."

"Shall we discuss this later, sirs?" the Marine sergeant said, her tone making
it clear that she wasn't actually asking a question.

Something chattered behind them. Sharp dots stitched across the concrete above
their heads. "Affin' hell!" Uncle Jack roared.

Needle guns crackled behind them again as two of the Marines turned and returned
fire. "Go!" the sergeant ordered, shoving them one by one through the door at
the end of the corridor.

Wales stumbled and went down on one knee. "Sorry," he gasped. Dark red blood
spurted from twin punctures where a stray needle had punched through his thigh.

The sergeant took his arm and began to drag him forward. "No!" Wales shook her
off. "The failsafe... It thinks I'm wounded..." To Iffy's horror, the purple
square on the end of the toolbox had started blinking.

"Cover me!" Wales ordered the sergeant. Without waiting to see if she did, he
opened the toolbox and began pulling parts out.

"What the hell are you doing? Sir?" the Marine demanded incredulously.

"Start where you are," Wales muttered. "Start where you are, use what you have,
help who you can." Two skeletal legs, a wheel of nested gears only slightly
smaller than Iffy's hand, a complicated not-quite-a-box to hold it all
together---all of a sudden Iffy could see the parts in her head and how they had
to fit together.

"Lemme do that," she said as Wales's shaking hands dropped a thumb-sized
cylinder on the floor. She twisted two already-assembled parts around,
tightened them, and clipped the cylinder into place. "It'll be more stable like
this."

Wales handed her more parts without hesitation or question. When she handed the
newly-made bot back to him he turned it over for one last check and then flung
it at the wall. Its gyroscopic gearwheel spinning madly, the little machine
scampered up to the ceiling.

"If that's a bomb---" the sergeant began.

"Directional broadband pulse," Wales panted as the little machine disappeared
around the corner. "It'll blind them for sure, knock them out if we're lucky."

*I know that,* Iffy realized incredulously. How could I know that? How did I
*know how to put it together?*

Wales struggled to his feet, swaying slightly before putting a hand on the wall
to steady himself. Blood was no longer pumping out of his leg, but when he
tried to take a step he almost collapsed. "Here," the sergeant said. She
switched her gun to her other hand and slipped under his shoulder.

The lights went out. Iffy's heart skipped a beat even as they flickered back to
life. "That's one," Wales grunted. He hopped forward on his good leg, gasping
as his toolbox bumped against the wounded one. The purple light on its end was
still blinking.

Mechanical claws scraped on the concrete behind them. Iffy spun around as a
lone sentry came around the corner. The now-empty micro-missile launcher on its
back gave it a hunched appearance, and the fresh scratches on its side where the
mansion's mechanical rats had clawed at it made its camouflage flicker and jump.
Twin needle guns on the sides of its head chattered, their ammunition spent.

The Marine pushed Wales away and fired two quick shots. The sentry jerked as
the shaped needles pinged off one of its mechanical knees. With a sound that
could almost have been a growl it threw itself at them.

A small shape dropped from the ceiling and landed on its back. Iffy had just a
moment to recognize Wales' toy bear before the lights went out again. One
second, two, three... When they came back to life the sentry lay motionless on
its side. The toy bear stood over it, the blue light in its eyes fading,
fading, gone.

"Could you... could you please get that?" Wales asked Iffy weakly as he slumped
down against the wall. "I have a feeling we might need it again."

Iffy only managed two steps before the world swam around her. She heard Wales
call her name, but it was as if he was speaking from unimaginably far away.
Everything seemed distant and somehow tilted, the way it had the one time she
had tried drinking some of Uncle Jack's rum. She turned slowly, impossibly
slowly, wondering who had replaced the walls with schematics. "That conduit is
going to start leaking if someone doesn't mend it," she tried to say, but the
words wouldn't come out, and even if they did, Wales and the Marine had been
replaced by schematics too.

She woke up lying on a couch in yet another windowless office. Something about
the damp air told her she was underground. She turned her head. "Hey,
sweetie," Aunt Naggie said, her soft voice and the gentle hand she put on her
foster daughter's forehead completely failing to disguise her worry or relief.

"Hey," Iffy replied. She started to sit up, but let her aunt stop her with only
a mumbled protest.

She turned her head at the sound of voices. A medic with two tech fingers on
her right hand was patching Wales up on another couch while the governor
interrogated him. No, Wales repeated wearily, he had no idea how the G-80 had
been compromised, or how it had infected the sentries. He had just been
guessing when he said it was some sort of machine hypnosis. No, he wouldn't
show them what else he had in his toolbox---not yet. And yes, he did realize
that made him look like he was hiding something. "But that's because I am," he
said, eyeing his cut-off trouser leg sadly. He hadn't flinched when the medic
probed his wound with a whisker-slim instrument extruded from one of her metal
fingers, or when she started to fill the hole with pink goo from a squeeze tube.

"The question is what?" The governor paced restlessly as he spoke. "What kind
of man has a fully functional mil sat link in his head, tactical antimatter
bombs in his luggage, and an unregistered clone as an apprentice?"

Iffy froze at the word "clone". It was something other children had called her
when she was little to make her cry, something Uncle Jack muttered just loudly
enough to be overheard when he was in a particularly bad mood. "Nothin' to be
ashamed of," Aunt Naggie said firmly the one time Iffy talked to her about it.
"Y'are who y'are, an' I love who y'are, and that's the all of it."

But the word didn't seem to register with Wales, or maybe he just didn't care.
He pushed the medic's hands away. "I'm the sort of man who can change the world
for you," he said firmly.

Governor Stern pivoted to face him. "Oh really?" His eyes sparkled the same
way as Doctor Johel's, Iffy suddenly realized, but there in that underground
room it was scary instead of magical.

"Really." Wales straightened up with a wince. "Or at least, give you the tools
you need to do it yourself." When the governor raised an eyebrow, he continued,
"There's a research base at the foot of Mount Tyree, a couple of hundred klicks
inland from Paddington South. It was under the ice sheet when it was built, but
there's been enough melt to expose the entrance."

The governor's fingers drummed on his thighs. His eyes sparkled again---some
kind of direct visual input shining light straight into his retinas, Iffy
guessed. "All right, there's a base," he said as whatever he had just seen
confirmed what Wales had just said. "But it was cleared out years ago. And
anyway, everybody who was anybody built some kind of secret lab down here. What
makes this one special?"

"It wasn't cleared out. And it was never really a lab. Or at least, not just a
lab." Wales locked eyes with Doctor Johel. "It was a backup ground station for
the Niobium satellite network. And as far as I can tell, it's still
functional."

"That's ridiculous," Doctor Johel said, as calmly as if she ordering a cup of
tea. "Governor, I was part of the last team that tried to reactivate Niobium.
I spent years digging into the records, and there was no hint in any of them of
a backup station."

The governor raised a hand to interrupt her. "Convince me," he ordered Wales.

Wales closed his eyes and reeled off a list of coordinates. The numbers meant
nothing to Iffy, but from the looks on Governor Stern's and Doctor Johel's
faces, they recognized at least some of them. "I can bring up your drones,
too," Wales said when he was done. "If we can get to the base, you can see
everything the Brazilians have, every moment of the day."

"And you're just going to give that to us out of the goodness of your heart?"
the governor asked pointedly.

Wales smiled wanly. "Of course not." He nodded to the medic. "Tell him what
you found."

The medic looked at the governor for permission. When the old man nodded, she
said, "He's been tweaked, sir. Oxygen uptake, metabolic efficiency, chromatin
structure---it'll take a while to sort it all out."

Governor Stern cocked his head to the side. "And?" Every tenth person in
Antarctica had some sort of tweak, most of them inherited from grandparents or
great-grandparents who had been early settlers or suffered from genetic
disorders or whose own parents had more money than good sense.

"And every once in a while I need a reboot," Wales said. He tapped the tech in
his temple. "This was designed for baseline human physiology. It doesn't get
along with my upgrades as well as I'd like. If I don't re-set every few years,
my nervous system starts to shut down. I used to be able to get it fixed in
Nairobi, but since the civil war re-started..." He shrugged. "As far as I
know, that base is the last place on Earth with the gear I need."

The governor nodded slowly. "Interesting." He communed for a moment with the
city core, then nodded again. "All right. Sergeant?"

"Yes sir," the Marine said, speaking for the first time since she, Wales, and
Iffy had survived the sentry's attack.

"Take these three back to their ship. Just until I decide what to do next," he
continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth. "You can resupply while you wait, at
city expense. Mister Wales, you'll be my guest here."

"An' what if we decide we'd rather not stick around?" Uncle Jack demanded,
belligerent once again now that the danger had passed. "You gonna put
*surveillance* on us t' make sure we stay put?"

Iffy gulped. Aunt Naggie gasped, and even the Marine grunted despite her
conditioning. Computer cores had watched people every moment of every day for
years in the run-up to their rebellion. Humanity had designed them to do that,
and had come close to extinction as a result. Children learned that
surveillance was evil at the same as they were potty trained. Accusing someone
of doing it was a lot even by Uncle Jack's standards.

"I don't think surveillance will be necessary," the governor said evenly. "But
I *will* post a Marine or two at the docks, and you really shouldn't try to
leave until our business is concluded. I trust that will be acceptable."
Without waiting for an answer to what hadn't actually been a question he turned
and left.

## Chapter 5

"I will *not* go *anywhere* until I've done some shopping!" Aunt Naggie said
emphatically, straightening her back like a soldier expecting to be shot.
"Because if I do, you'll be the first one to complain."

For a moment Iffy was sure Uncle Jack would explode again, but to her surprise
he backed down. "Fine," he snapped, waving her away. "You go get whatever we
need. I'm gonna look at th' engine an' see what th' sainted *Mister Wales* has
gaffled up. And take th' girl with you," he added over his shoulder as he
stalked away. "Had enough o' her underfoot for one day."

Aunt Naggie slumped and took a deep breath. "Good on you," Iffy said, punching
her lightly in the shoulder.

Her aunt smiled shakily. The Marines had driven them back to the pier with
strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened at the governor's mansion.
The fact that the feeds on the *Guinevere*'s screens were talking about nothing
else didn't seem to matter. Half of Antarctica seemed to think it was a
stealthy first strike by the Zillions---or second, if the feeder was counting
the explosion at the quarantine shed in Halley. The other half was convinced
the machines were about to rise again, either on their own or with the backing
of whatever networked hypermind currently ruled China-over-the-Sea. Iffy's
heart sank at grainy video of a crowd armed with pulse guns and cutting torches
chasing a maintenance bot through the streets of Paddington hundreds of
kilometers away. It wasn't French Henry, but it would be soon if things didn't
calm down.

It only took Aunt Naggie a minute to gather up a trio of sturdy mesh bags and an
ancient handheld piece of tech that she swore would tell them if anything was
toxic. Iffy slipped a few of her smaller tools into a waistbelt under her
coat---if she was lucky, someone in the market would have mending work she could
do for a few rand while Aunt Naggie hunted for onions, soy, and noodles.

After dragging a brush through her close-cropped hair and watching sternly while
Iffy, under protest, did the same, Aunt Naggie strode down the gangplank with
her adopted daughter in her wake. One of the Marines listened patiently as Aunt
Naggie explained where she was going and why. As she launched somewhat
breathlessly into the details of her shopping list, he held up a hand to stop
her. "Get whatever you need," he said, handing her a black-edged money card.
"But keep in mind that Finance will charge things back to you if it thinks
they're luxuries." He glanced pointedly over her shoulder at Uncle Jack, whose
plan for looking at the engine seemed to consist of leaning on the *Guinevere*'s
railing and scowling at everyone and everything.

Rothera's streets were busy but not crowded. Its older stores clustered along
the harborfront like gulls standing just out of reach of the waves, their signs
bigger and brighter than those in Halley. Familiar cartoon characters and
celebrities from far-off Australia beckoned, danced, pouted, and cracked jokes
as people walked by. Iffy would have gone in to each one, but Aunt Naggie
hurried past them, her expression set. She regarded shopping as a competitive
sport, and clearly had no intention of letting Rothera beat her.

The city's main market had originally been an aircraft hangar. A century ago,
someone with more money than sense had added a spun glass floor two stories
above the ground. Their attempt to turn the building into "The Big South's
Biggest, Bestest Dance Hall!!" had failed almost immediately. After a couple of
unsuccessful attempts to oust the squatters who took it over after the war (many
in possession of surplus weapons, combat conditioning, and radical political
ideas), the governor and Rothera's core had thrown up their physical and
metaphorical hands and let anyone who could pay two rand a month set up a stall.
Still called the Dance Hall, it was the biggest surveillance-free zone in
Antarctica, and reminded Iffy of nothing so much as the picture of an anthill in
her older's nature book.

Aunt Naggie tapped her money card on the reader held out by the bored Marine at
the door to pay her ten pence admission fee and squared her shoulders. Noticing
Iffy's yearning look back toward the docks, she nudged her foster daughter with
her elbow. "Why'n't you go off an' see what you can find? Or who, if you've a
mind to?" she added teasingly.

Iffy felt her cheeks go warm. "Y' sure y' don' need me?"

Aunt Naggie looked around. Greenhouse potatoes hung in net bags next to stacks
of dried fruit in single-molecule shrink wrap. Burlap sacks of Cape Town rice
piled higher than Iffy was tall threatened to topple onto a line of people
gossiping with each other as they waited their turn to buy ginger, cardamom,
and bay leaves from a one-legged woman whose tweaked hair that sparkled red and
purple every time she turned her head. A surgical bot that had been converted
for tailoring stood motionless, its four skeletal arms at its sides, while a man
with a shaven head and an enormous beard struggled into a coat that was still a
size too small for him. "I'll be fine," Aunt Naggie said, as happy as Iffy ever
saw her.

Ten minutes later Iffy turned the corner onto Rocking Horse Street and hurried
toward a stubby never-finished canal that Rothera's mechanics had taken over to
use as a repair yard. A sleek Marine cutter was tied up on one side while
crab-like bots scrambled over its hull to scrape off the weaponized barnacles
that would, if left unchecked, slowly devour the fractal carbon that made it
nearly frictionless. Iffy would normally have stopped to watch, but right then
she had other things on her mind.

She slowed to a walk as she approached the end of the canal. Her heart sank.
Two women were working side by side in the salvage booth, but both were too old
to be who she was hoping to see.

"Hey, Iffy!" She whirled around just in time to be caught up in an enormous
hug. "Hey," Honesty said more softly, her cheek pressed against Iffy's. "Micka
tol' me she tuck y'all come in, an' then I twitched what happen up along th'
governor's. I's worried along by you."

Iffy returned the hug awkwardly. She always felt awkward around Honesty,
especially when they were close enough that she could smell whatever flowery
concoction the other girl used to wash her hair, but it was a good kind of
awkward, a *really* good kind that she couldn't stop thinking about.

"I'm fine," she said, her voice muffled slightly by the fake rat fur collar on
Honesty's coat. She slithered free of the hug and took a step back. "I'm
fine," she repeated. "It was just some bots gone rogue."

"Just some bots?" Honesty repeated disbelievingly. "Din't looka that on th'
news. Looka th' war come back 'round!"

"It wasn't all that," Iffy said dismissively. Honesty had changed the tattoos
on her cheeks again, she noticed. And she'd done some more embroidery on the
cuffs of her coat to match.

"But what happen? I mean, really happen, not just official happen?" Honesty
slipped her arm through Iffy's as if it was the most natural thing in the world
and steered her toward her family's workshop at the end of the canal.

Iffy felt into step alongside her, desperately hoping her friend couldn't hear
her heart thudding in her chest. Honesty---properly, Honesty's Third, but only
her olders called her that---was three years her senior. She had been singing
on a street corner across from the Dance Hall the first time Iffy saw her. She
hadn't meant to stop, but then Honesty caught her eye and smiled in the middle
of a chorus without missing a beat. They'd only spent time together half a
dozen times since then, but each time had been---

"Sorry?" she said belatedly.

Honesty rolled her eyes. "I *said*, why're you up along there? You gettin'
fancy or some?"

"I ain't never gettin' fancy!" Iffy protested automatically, her accent
thickening unconsciously to match her friend's. "We just kinda got dragged inta
things." She summarized the last few days as briefly as she could, skating past
what had happened to the Zillion ship and her part in assembling the bot that
had saved them at the mansion. She still didn't want to think about that...

Even with those gaps, her story left Honesty wide-eyed. "Tay bangle, that's a
real adventure, innit?" She bumped her hip against Iffy's, but her tone turned
serious as she nodded at the Marine cutter under repair beside them. "So's that
why we got th' ganky to finish up this 'un? 'Cuz my First, she thought we had a
coupla weeks f'r it, but the blues come along day b'fore last an' said we gotta
be crannup t' sail soonest."

Iffy swallowed drily. Two days past was the day Wales had made the sea boil and
sent the *Taroona* to the bottom. "Yeah, prolly," she mumbled.

Honesty bumped her hip against Iffy again. "Good," she said firmly. "'Cuz they
payin' up'n'all, an' we can use the jing. Second wants t' make another li'
sister," she confided with a grin. "Wou'nt that be a thing? Now c'mon---I bet
there's tea brewa." She unhooked her arm from Iffy's and took the younger
girl's hand.

Iffy's mind whirled. Another clone? It made sense---Honesty had just turned
sixteen, so she and a younger clone would be spaced far enough apart to be on
the right side of legal---but... Before she blurt out any of the dozen
questions swirling around in her head, Honesty squeezed her fingers painfully
hard and shot her a warning sidelong glance.

Iffy's mouth snapped shut. Thumb, middle finger, first finger, middle finger...
She almost stumbled as she recognized the code that resistance fighters had
developed to hide their words from surveillance during the robot wars, and that
children now used to keep secrets from adults. Little finger and fourth finger
together, middle finger, middle and fourth... The words and letters took shape
in her head as Honesty tapped them out. The blues were watching. They had left
some cheese behind (no, that didn't make any sense, Honesty must have meant some
cameras), so they had to be careful what they said.

There was no point trying to spot the cameras---they could be as small as grains
of sand. Each would pass information to its equally small neighbors in
low-energy bursts of not-quite-static until it reached whatever bored Marine had
been told to keep an eye on the repair yard. A core would have done a better
job---it wouldn't get bored or doze for just a moment despite its induction
conditioning---but if the governor ever used cores for surveillance, he'd have a
riot on his hands.

She squeezed Honesty's hand twice to signal that she understood, but when she
loosened her grip, Honesty tightened hers. Iffy waited for more taps. When
they didn't come, she realized that her friend was sending a different kind of
message. She walked the last hundred meters to the workshop with a dazed smile
on her face that would have made her aunt sigh happily.

Honesty's First and Second looked up and said, "G'day," simultaneously as
Honesty pulled aside the splotched canvas curtain that hung in the salvage
booth's doorway. "You gi'n her th' bad news yen?" her First asked in an accent
as strong as the tea she poured for Iffy without asking.

Honesty pouted. "I's gonna!"

"Sorry," her First said unapologetically. Her Second looked up from her
workbench long enough to grin. Her magnifying glasses made her eyes look
cartoon-huge in a face that showed how beautiful Honesty's would be in the years
to come.

"What bad news?" Iffy asked.

"My call-up came 'long yesterday," Honesty said reluctantly. "Whole buncha folk
'long the docks got 'em. We gotta do induction t'night."

Iffy's stomach flip-flopped. "Tonight?" *But I just got here!* she thought
despairingly.

Honesty shrugged, settling herself on a stool next to the square meter of
workbench where she salvaged the easier bits and pieces of tech that came her
family's way. "Yeah. Lotsa folk are wonderin' why the quaddy quaddy, but the
blues ain't sayin' bunga 'cept that it come along straight from th' governor.
Figure it's got somethin' to do with th' bots going gonjy 'long yesterday?"

"I dunno," Iffy said. Anger suddenly welled up inside her. Jeep had *changed*
when the Marines pumped their rules and tactics into his head. What would it do
to her friend? "Seems like I don't know nothin' these days."

"Aw, that ain't true," Honesty's First said. Her face and smile were more
practiced versions of her grand-younger's. Where Honesty had temporary tattoos,
her First had whorling blue lines that turned the scars left by some long-ago
accident into something like art. She tossed the piece of tech she had been
cleaning to Iffy. "Any gunna what that's for?"

Iffy caught it and turned it over in her hands. It was made of metal, and
heavier than she'd have guessed. Microparticles of ocean plastic had worked
themselves into its tiny intricate gears, giving it the all-too-familiar soapy
feel of age and neglect. The different kinds of plastic would have welded to
each other to weave a hard fractal mass through the gears that couldn't be
pulled out of them without damaging their tiny micro-precise teeth. It would
take hours of patient work with ice, acid, tweaked bacteria, and
micro-manipulators to tease it all apart, and at the end all they'd have would
be---

"It's a differential separator pump," she told Honesty's First as shapes and
clues came together in her head to form an answer as clear as it was impossible
for her to know. "Prolly hooks up to a centrifuge or somethin' for filterin'
blood durin' surgery."

"'Zat so?" Honesty's First said, impressed. She caught the part when Iffy
threw it back to her and passed it to her Second, who studied it for a moment,
shrugged as if to say, "Could be," and set it on the to-do rack that lined the
wall behind the workbench. "How 'bout these?"

The box she passed to Iffy opened to reveal squares woven from fractal carbon
fiber, each the size of her nature book and as thin as half a dozen pages
together. It took her a second to realize that the little grommets patterned
across the squares were rotors, and that each square was some kind of flexible
dronelet. She turned one over in her hands. "Dunno," she admitted. "How d'you
switch it on?"

"No idea," Honesty's First said cheerfully. "Best guess is they was fer some
kinda game."

"Shaw," her Second said, looking up from the machine she had spent the last
three days trying to clean and reassemble. "They's too fine jarra game. I's
fer they bin up some kinda survey mappin'."

"Mebbe," Honesty's First admitted. Casually, looking past Iffy rather than at
her, she asked, "You ain't got fra yer...notions?"

Iffy shook her head. She had told Honesty about her occasional flashes of
insight, then told her off, cold and hard, when she learned that her friend had
relayed what she'd said to her First and Second. "We don't keep secrets on
achother," Honesty had said with a shrug. "Y'ain't aright along that, best we
part ways now." So Iffy had forgiven her, secretly relieved that her best and
only friend knew she was different but didn't seem to care.

When Iffy handed back the box of dronelets, Honesty's First waved her away.
"Not much use t'us if we can't turn 'em on," she said, though Iffy knew the
little rotors would be worth a meal if they were pried out and sold as parts.
"If anythin' comes t' mind, you come by an' gi's a scutch, aright? An' even if
nothin' does, we's alluz happy t'have one more fer dinner or a sleepover." She
winked broadly.

"Thanks," Iffy mumbled. Her upbringing had taught her how to rig sails in heavy
weather and mend engines older than her foster parents, but not what to do when
people were kind to her. She drained the last of her tea. "I oughta get back
t' help Aunt Naggie an' th' shopping."

"Sure," Honesty said. "But you'll come along after an' eat?" She poked Iffy in
the ribs. "Y'always maw skinny."

Iffy blushed. "I'll ask," she said, mumbling again.

Honesty hooked her arm through Iffy's again. "Bonza. I'll walk you out."

They held hands all the way up the canal. As usual, Honesty did most of the
talking. When her induction notice arrived, she had fired back a message right
away, and wouldn't you know it, she had to finish the last of her schoolwork
anyway, which was *so* unfair. Anyway, what was the point? She knew tons more
about salvaging old tech than the crufty old core that was supposed to be
teaching her, and whatever she didn't know, she could learn from her First and
Second or from Iffy, right?

"I s'pose," Iffy allowed.

"Oh c'mon." Honesty bumped her hip against Iffy's. "M' First and Uncle Osman
'long by Pier Nine asked two different cores about that first piece she showed
you. They neither had a siggy what it was, an' then you jus' come right out an'
tell 'em. The stuff you have in your head," she finished admiringly, shaking
her own in wonder.

*I'd feel better about it if I knew how it got there,* Iffy thought. For the
thousandth time she wondered if her clone parents had been able to do what she
could---if they had thought of it as a gift or a burden or both. And for the
thousandth time, she wished she could ask them.

They said goodbye by the bow of the Marine cutter. One of the repair bots
paused a moment to watch them kiss, its simple-minded core wondering who was
repairing whom, then erased the thought as Iffy hurried back into town to the
Dance Hall and her aunt.

The streets around the market were crowded by the time Iffy got there. Four
Indonesian Mormons handed out glossy animated pamphlets advertising their
church's insurance policies, smiling forgiveness at a ragged man yelling that
the Singularity had come, they were all living in a simulation, the data proved
it, they just had to look at the data and they would see the truth! A bot with
a rasping voice and an ancient plastic mask for a face told stories to a circle
of wide-eyed children. Its cut-out paper puppets danced as Zuko battled
Princess Leia while his boyfriend Aang struggled to free Elsa from the evil
robot Wintermute. Two bald women who might have been twins but were probably
just clones wheeled a cartful of blankets woven from tweaked moss past two men
arguing beside another cart piled high with curved sheets of diamond that cast
quivering rainbows on the ground. The smell of soy being fried in ginger mixed
with the wet steamy warmth from rice cookers, the salty tang of tweaked seaweed
being boiled into soup, and the smell of people who washed when they could.

Iffy paused longingly in front of a stall selling rats with startling blue eyes.
"They make great pets. Or snacks!" the man said, hastily adding, "Just
kidding! Just kidding!" when Iffy scowled at him. "And look!" He leaned over
and said, "Ratty want a cracker?"

"Idjit!" the rat squeaked back. "Yer an idjit!"

"See?" the man said proudly. "You can teach 'em a coupla hunnert words, easy!"

"I know," Iffy said wistfully, a sudden unexpected pang in her heart. She held
her finger a few millimeters in front of one of the cages. The rat sniffed at
it. "Idjit," it pronounced in its tiny squeaky voice.

*One day*, Iffy promised herself as she straightened up and hurried on her way.
One day, when she had a workshop of her own and she could keep whatever pets and
plants she wanted and Honesty could come by all the time. (Even in her
daydreams, she didn't dare imagine that they would live together.) One
day---but not today.

The Dance Hall was just as busy inside as out. Iffy tried slipping through the
crush the way Honesty somehow did, then gave up and resigned herself to moving
at the pace of the meandering crowd. She glanced up as a drone the size of her
hand whined by, its dozen crystal eyes scanning the crowd. "Some all got they
riled up," a stall keeper muttered, noticing Iffy's look. "They 'long by all
place today. You t'ink it be come by they fight up along th' gov'nor's?"

"I dunno," Iffy said. Drones had microphones as well as cameras, and the last
thing she wanted was some stray word of hers catching the governor's attention.
"'Scuse me." She ducked under a tarnished video carpet hanging from a
clothesline and pushed her way into the crowd on the other side.

And froze. And ducked back behind the video carpet again. She squeezed her
eyes shut. She must have been mistaken---she couldn't have seen what she
thought she just saw. She shook her head and slowly peeked around the carpet's
edge.

There, just a couple of meters away, stood Aunt Naggie and a trim Asian man in a
patched brown and gray uniform of the old Ecological Corps. Iffy couldn't hear
what they were saying over the bustle of the crowd, but from the way they were
looking into each others' eyes she was pretty sure they weren't discussing
topsoil formation.

The ecologist handed Aunt Naggie something and leaned forward to kiss her on the
cheek. The space above their heads flickered as he did so. It was another
video carpet, Iffy realized, strung between four posts like a canopy to conceal
them from the drones overhead. It flickered again as Aunt Naggie pulled the man
closer and kissed him for real.

Iffy's stomach flip-flopped the way it did when she read some of the steamier
passages in the romances Aunt Naggie loved so much. The ecologist stepped back,
a bland smile replacing the genuine warmth of a moment before. He gestured at
one of the carpets hanging on a display rack beside him. "Perhaps this one?"
he asked a little too loudly.

Aunt Naggie's reply was cut off by a sudden crackle of static. "Citizens!" The
stern mechanical voice cut through the market bustle. "Remain where you are!
There is no cause for alarm! This safety notice is brought to you by Volkov's
Hot Sauce!"

A high-pitched alarm began to ping. The ecologist looked up as the drone that
Iffy had seen earlier buzzed lower, then glanced toward the entrance at the
sound of boots and angry shouts. A squad of Marines in exoskeletons were
clanking through the crowd, visors down and shock sticks in their hands.

"Citizens! Remain where you are! And try Volkov's---there's nothing hotter
this side of the Cairo Crater!" The drone jinked sideways to dodge a thrown
scrap of bamboo. Something clanged off a Marine's exoskeleton. Someone
shouted, "Show us yer warrant 'r show us your backside!" Other voices took up
the cry. "Show us yer warrant!"

*Great,* Iffy thought, *Another affin' dock fight.* She pulled aside the carpet
she had been hiding behind and hurried toward Aunt Naggie just in time to hear
the ecologist say, "Please, you should go."

Whatever Aunt Naggie might have replied was cut off by the sight of her foster
daughter. "Iffy?" she gasped. "What're you doin' here?"

"Came lookin' for you," Iffy said breathlessly. She nodded at the ecologist.
"H'lo. I'm---"

"---Fifth of Ang Kwan," he finished, bowing slightly. "It's a pleasure to meet
you. Nagatha has told me a great about you."

"Hasn't told me anything about *you*," Iffy said, immediately regretting her
attempt to be flippant.

But the ecologist simply smiled. "That's probably for the best."

"But Iffy, you ain't supposed t' be here!" Aunt Naggie said helplessly. "I
thought you were down along th' docks?"

"I was," Iffy said defensively. "What's goin' on?"

"They're after someone," the ecologist said calmly. He put his hand on Aunt
Naggie's arm. "You have to go. Nagatha, you have to."

Aunt Naggie dug in her heels. "No." She took hold of the ecologist's hand.
"It ain't safe for you here no more."

"*Im awa pfa ta,*" he muttered under his breath. "Fine." He pulled a bright
orange knit cap out of a pocket of his old uniform jacket and pulled it low over
head ears, then shrugged out of the jacket and tossed it aside. "You two head
for Bower Street. I'll get to the door by Alphabet Alley and see you at
the---at the grocery," he finished, catching himself.

Aunt Naggie hesitated. *That ain't gonna work,* Iffy thought. The drones
overhead weren't allowed to be any smarter than seagulls, but even something
that dumb could recognize the way someone walked, and the ecologist's cap wasn't
doing anything to cover his face. If any of the drones caught a glimpse of
them---

"Wait!" Iffy pulled the box that Honesty's First had given her out of her
pocket. "C'mon c'mon c'mon," she muttered. "Please, just this once." She had
never been able to control her flashes of intuition. They came when they
wanted. This was a stupid idea. They should be running. They should---

And there it was. How could she not have seen it before? There and there
together and then there, two presses and a third, and *zip!* A thin film in the
center of the dronelet peeled back to reveal a foil battery, a hair-thin fractal
antenna, and---

"*Shway boo*," she whispered unbelievingly. The dronelet's crystal core was
twice the size of a grain of rice, and its flat, unreflective black surface
meant it had probably been grown in orbit. If the other dronelets had similar
cores, then together they would be worth enough for Iffy to outfit an entire
workshop.

"Iffy, what're you doin?" She ignored her foster mother and the alarms and the
pressure of the ecologist's stare as she pulled tools out of her pockets.

"You got any scraps this big?" she asked over her shoulder, holding her hands a
few centimeters apart.

"Here." He handed her half a dozen swatches of video fabric, each the size of a
handkerchief. Iffy measured one against a dronelet, then winced as she pried
two of the rotors out of the stiff black fabric. She'd never be able to repair
the damage, not even with the kind of tech she'd seen in Wales' toolboxes, but
she didn't dare cutting into the dronelet fabric itself.

It took her a moment to tuck the corners of the video square into the holes
she'd made. Now for the hard part. She closed her eyes and willed the images
to come together. These bits were the dronelets---don't worry now about how she
knew or why she could see its programming as clearly as she could see its
hardware---and this over here was the video square, and that was its connection
to the outside world, so if she shone a laser *here* and sent a pulse-coded
access request, then told the dronelet and the video square to trust each other
no matter what their other programming said, then---

"Gotcha!" The dronelet rose, tilted, and levelled as the image on its back
flickered and steadied to show the top of a woman's head.

The Asian ecologist grunted. "She really can, can't she?" he said to Aunt
Naggie.

Iffy's foster mother nodded. "Y'aright?" she asked Iffy.

"I'm fine," Iffy lied. Her head was swimming. Everything around her seemed
unreal. The stalls were just wireframes. Her dronelets were clouds of
software, patched and patched again to defend against viruses until there was
only room for the most limited intelligence. It was like a badly-written sim.

"Iffy!" Aunt Naggie shook her. The world blinked back to normal. "Iffy,
c'mon, we gotta go."

"Gimme a minute!" Eighty-five seconds later, two more awkward patch-ups were
humming quietly in the air beside her, each showing a different downloaded
image. She took a deep breath and transmitted one last set of instructions.

The patches of video fabric flickered. The images solidified to show top-down
views of Iffy, Aunt Naggie, and someone whom she hoped looked enough like the
ecologist to convince a drone. "Start walkin'," she ordered the two adults.
"Just a coupla steps. Aright, that's enough." *I hope,* she added to herself.

She strung a few more commands together and threw them into the dronelets'
cores. They began to sway slightly in an unconvincing imitation of the way
people moved when walking. "Which way's Alphabet Alley?" she asked.

A few moments later the dronelets were out of sight, on their way north with
(Iffy hoped) the hunting drones on their trail. She, Aunt Naggie, and the
ecologist hurried in the opposite direction. As they turned left by a rack of
bicycles and a stall selling rolls of microfiber sailcloth, a man in front of
them asked, "Ya pins they trappa thief?"

"Net says they's sweepin' fer some kinda sab," the woman beside him replied,
scanning a feed only she could see through heavy yellow-tinted glasses.

Her companion snorted. "Bad case o' someone din't pay off the blues is more
likely." His companion shushed him.

Even as she did so, the drones above boomed, "Citizens! We require your
assistance! Please remain calm, and remember, Volkov's makes it vetter!"

"Guess they got their warrant," the man in front of Iffy muttered.

Every screen in the Dance Hall blanked for an instant. When they came back to
life, every one showed a younger version of the ecologist. Instead of a suit,
he was wearing the green and gold uniform of the Brazilian Defense Co-operative.

"You're a Zillion?" Iffy gasped.

The ecologist pulled his arm out of Aunt Naggie's. "Keep walking," he ordered,
yanking the orange knit cap off his head. Without waiting for a reply he turned
right toward a stall selling animated toys and compact ship-board cooking
equipment.

A pair of Marines stepped out from behind it. One raised a shock stick as the
other levelled a tangle gun. "Citizen! Halt!" they said in unison.

The ecologist threw himself to the side, tossing his cap into the air. It
exploded in a dazzling cloud of orange stars just as the Marine's tangle gun
burped a web of sticky plastic microfibers. People shrieked. The shot went
wide, the gun's auto-sight dazzled by the ecologist's counter-measures.

The couple in front of Iffy and Aunt Naggie fell heavily to the ground, shouting
and struggling as the tangle net tightened around them. The ecologist vaulted
over a counter-top, knocked a wok full of steaming noodles aside, and pulled up
short as another pair of Marines clanked around the corner to block his way.

"Iffy, c'mon, we gotta go!" Aunt Naggie tugged her arm.

Iffy shook her off, tapping frantically at her keypad. There! Her three
dronelets zipped through the air straight for the Marines. They spun around,
their inducted reflexes pulling their weapons up in the face of an unknown new
threat just long enough for the ecologist to look wildly around for another way
out.

But there wasn't one. Two---no, three---of the Marines' drones were buzzing
overhead. The first Marine chambered another stubby round in his tangle gun and
raised it.

The ecologist turned to face Aunt Naggie. "Start where you are," he said. "Use
what you have, help who you can." He clenched his hand to make a fist and
pressed it against his temple. As Aunt Naggie shrieked "no!" the lights around
them flickered. The ecologist's head snapped back and he collapsed like a
puppet whose strings had been cut.

Iffy gaped in disbelief. He had brainwiped himself! Spies and disappointed
lovers did it in sims, but---but this was real life! People didn't scramble
their brains in real life!

Aunt Naggie made a strangled sound as the Marines hurried toward the twitching
form on the ground. Iffy took her arm. "Auntie!" She tugged at her gently.
"Auntie, we need to get outta here."

"I can't..." Shock and disbelief mingled on her face. "I can't just *leave*
him."

"Auntie, we gotta." Iffy tapped out a few commands, then took one of the
shopping bags from her foster mother's slack grip and pulled her into motion.

They wove through the crowd, trying to hurry without looking like they were
hurrying. Every time someone bumped into them, Iffy was sure the next thing she
would feel would be a hand coming down on her shoulder, and that the next thing
she would hear would be a stern voice asking her where she thought she was
going.

But somehow they made it to the doors. Iffy pulled her foster mother to the
side and sent one final command. The three dronelets appeared and settled onto
a stayline like tea towels hung out to dry. Iffy tore off the video fabric and
put the dronelets back in their box. "C'mon," she told Aunt Naggie.

They joined the muttering throng pushing through the door and were suddenly out
on the street, blinking in the cold, hard light. "C'mon," Iffy said again.
"Let's get home."

Aunt Naggie nodded without speaking. They turned a corner, then another, and
then Aunt Naggie pulled up short. "I'm sorry, sweetie," she said, wiping her
eyes. "I'm sorry."

"No worries," Iffy said awkwardly, not knowing whether to hug her aunt or not.
A passerby slowed, hesitated, and hurried on her way as Iffy glared at her.
"What happened? Who was he?"

"Sh!" Aunt Naggie glanced around fearfully. "Not out here."

"But---"

"Later!" Aunt Naggie sniffled and wiped her eyes one more time before
straightening up. "Come on," she said, the weight of a lifetime in her voice.
"We're a'ready late for gettin' back."

Uncle Jack had worked himself into a smoldering rage by the time they reached
the *Guinevere*. "Can't make up or down o' what he's done to things," he
snarled by way of a hello, wiping his hands angrily on a greasy rag. A double
dozen boxes sat in a pile on deck, each bearing the Marines' blue crown stamp.
One had been torn open to reveal strips of plastic for patching seams in the
hull, another to show a fitting for a bilge pump that hadn't worked properly in
years. It was more new parts than the old jelly dredger had seen since before
Iffy first set foot on her, but all Uncle Jack could talk about was how the
repairs that Wales had made weren't how things ought to be done, it looked like
core work, he was tweaked somehow, and how were regular folks supposed to
understand a tangle like that?

"Maybe it'll make more sense after dinner," Aunt Naggie ventured.

"As if," Uncle Jack snorted. "Didja get your precious groceries?"

For a moment Iffy thought her aunt would start crying again. Instead, she
nodded wordlessly and carried her shopping into the galley.

Iffy watched silently as Aunt Naggie took out her feelings on an onion. Once it
was diced and sizzling in hot oil, she cubed a block of soy and attacked the
other vegetables. "Anythin' I can do?" Iffy finally asked, worried and afraid
and wanting to help but not knowing how. She had never seen her aunt like this,
not even after the worst of Uncle Jack's rages.

Aunt Naggie swept the carrots and cabbage into the frying pan and forced a
smile. "Thanks, sweetie, but I'm aright. You should prolly go topside an' see
if you can sort him out."

Iffy stood and put her arms around the woman who had sheltered her from storms
of all kinds for most of her life. "I love you," she blurted.

Aunt Naggie set her knife down and hugged her foster daughter back. "I love you
too, sweetie," she said softly, her cheek pressed against her foster daughter's
shaven head. "Always an' forever. Don't you ever forget that, no matter what."

Iffy hung on when her aunt would have let go. "Was he---was he someone
special?"

Aunt Naggie kissed the top of Iffy's head. "Yeah, he was. In a lot o' ways."
She laughed shakily. "Prolly best if we don't talk about that in front o'
Jack, aright?"

"'Course not," Iffy agreed hastily. "But---why'd he---you know. Why'd he do
it?" *Why did he think he had to keep you safe?* she added in her head. *Why
do you know people who would do something like that? Why didn't I know you
did?*

"Lotta people were dependin' on him," Aunt Naggie said distantly, straightening
up and turning back to her cooking. "I guess this was the only way he could
keep 'em all safe."

Uncle Jack complained that their was too much curry in the stir fry and that the
noodles were overcooked. He took a second helping anyway, finished it before
Iffy and Aunt Naggie were through their first and only and stomped back up the
latter to yell at the engine some more. Iffy would have thrown his dirty plate
at his head if Aunt Naggie hadn't put a hand on her shoulder.

Later, cross-legged on her bed, Iffy set the last of the mysterious drones on
her mattress and went to work. Fifteen minutes later she sat back, defeated.
The three she had used in the Dance Hall had understood standard commands, but
when she tried probing their remaining sibling electronically, her home-made
wireshark showed nothing but frazzled gibberish. She yawned and packed it back
in its box. "Hope you're aright sleepin' on yer own," she whispered, then waved
her light off.

*She was on deck. The sky was a perfect blue, and Aunt Naggie was stuffing her
into her ecosuit. "Just in case, love," she said.*

*No, Iffy thought, and, "No!" she said. She wasn't going to go through this
again. She struggled to pull her arms out of the ecosuit.*

*"It's aright," Honesty said, already in hers. "It's aright, sweetie,
everythin's gonna be aright. We're gonna **make** it aright. You'll see."
With a barely perceptible whir, her head detached from the rest of her body and
rose into the air. Beneath them, the sea began to boil and churn. Iffy grabbed
hold of Aunt Naggie's leg and held on tight as the deck dropped away below her
and she fell into waking.*

"Iffy! Iffy, wake up!" Why was Aunt Naggie shaking her? And why did her head
hurt so much? "Iffy!"

"'m aright," she mumbled. She tried to sit up. No. That was a mistake. She
tried to tell whoever was shaking her to stop, it made the stabbing pain behind
her eyes worse, but someone had replaced her tongue with a slab of sour tofu.
All she could do was whimper.

"Iffy, please." Strong hands that smelled faintly of soap and onions forced her
jaws apart. She gagged as a finger pushed something dry and powdery into her
mouth. It tasted spicy, which made just as little sense as everything else that
was going on. The slosh of water that followed made her splutter. She tried to
spit it out, but those same strong hands wouldn't let her, so she swallowed.

"Easy, sweetie, easy." Familiar arms held her close. It was Aunt Naggie,
Iffy's fuzzy brain finally told her. She was in her cabin on her bed and the
lights were on and her foster mother was hugging her and her mouth tasted
*awful* but the pain behind her eyes was down from laser drill to
poke-with-a-sharp-stick.

"I'm aright," she repeated. There was something sticky---when she wiped her
face on her sleeve, it left a streak of red.

"You scared me, sweetie," Aunt Naggie whispered. "I coul'n't lose both of you."

Iffy let out a shaky breath. "Glad you din't." She worked her tongue in her
mouth. "Is this---is this curry powder?"

Aunt Naggie wiped her own face and nodded. "Sort of. There's medicine in it.
Ignacio---the fella you met today---he's been makin' it for me. For you, I
mean. Gets it to me through Mrs. Sandhu."

A chill ran down Iffy's spine. "Medicine for what?"

Aunt Naggie pulled a cloth out of her coat and wiped the nosebleed off Iffy's
face. "For this," she said quietly. "He knew your olders. Tol' me they'd
picked up somethin' bad somewhere along the way. Said you'd get spells as you
got older less you got treatment. Seemed t' be workin', 'least 'til recently."

She tucked the bloody cloth back into her coat. "You been seein' things, ain't
ya? That's how come you been so good with tech."

Iffy nodded wordlessly. The machines had done things to people during the war,
turned them into weapons and saboteurs and spies, sometimes without them even
knowing they'd been memed or tweaked. Nine tenths of every medical exam Iffy
had ever suffered through had been checks for things like that. It explained
everything, and now that she knew, it was like she'd always known.

Her foster mother gave her one last hug. "You go back to sleep," she said as
she stood, the precious jar of curry powder clutched in her hand. "We'll talk
on this some more t'morrow."

Iffy nodded, her eyes already closing as she lay down. She barely noticed Aunt
Naggie pulled the covers up over her, and was fast asleep by the time she kissed
her foster daughter's forehead and turned out the light.

## Chapter 6

Iffy woke the next morning to the sound of the Marines arriving. Two squads of
eight came first, each wearing a full exoskeleton and carrying a bulky pack.
Two squads of inductees trudged behind them, straining under packs that were
only slightly smaller. In between, Dr. Johel rode a little motorized scooter
with Johnson Wales sitting awkwardly on the back.

"Because Rothera Core ran a few sims," Dr. Johel explained testily to Uncle Jack
as she and Wales dismounted. "A few billion, actually, and it calculated that
this configuration gave us our best odds." She gestured at the sleek gray
destroyer that had taken up station a few hundred meters away from the pier
while Iffy slept. "You, the *Bengal*, these soldiers, and a couple of
spotters---that's what it says, so that's what we're doing."

"Well, all *I* can say is that---" Uncle Jack began to bluster.

"There's no point arguing," Wales cut in tiredly. His face was drawn as if he
hadn't slept since the attack on the governor's mansion. "Iffy, can you please
give me a hand with these?"

He patted the toolboxes that sat on a two-wheeled cart hitched behind the
scooter. Beside the cart, a cadet in a uniform three shades lighter than those
of the other Marines stood at attention, her eyes covered by a dark tactical
visor. Iffy looked past her to the canvas-covered machinery rolling up the pier
to be loaded onto the *Bengal*, then looked back in shock. It couldn't be. It
*couldn't* be.

Dr. Johel saw the expression on Iffy's face. "Ah, yes," she purred. "That was
another of the core's recommendations." She beckoned the cadet forward. "I
believe you two know each other?"

"Honesty?" Iffy somehow managed to say.

Her friend's expression didn't change. "Good morning, Kwan's Fifth." Her voice
was as stiff as her back and shoulders.

"Don't worry," Dr. Johel told Iffy. "Everyone's like that after their first
induction. She'll be herself again in a few days."

"More or less," Wales muttered.

"More or less," Dr. Johel agreed evenly. "But it *is* sometimes more."

"Sometimes," Wales agreed. He waved a hand at the gangplank. "Just take them
up there, please. Iffy can show you where they go."

"Yes sir." Without even glancing at her friend, Honesty unhitched the cart and
wheeled it up the gangplank. Wales gestured for Iffy to follow her, then
trudged onto the *Guinevere* behind them.

The toolboxes went in the cabin that Wales had used on the voyage from Halley.
He struggled awkwardly out of his coat, his wound obviously still bothering him.
"Maybe later," he said when Iffy asked him if he wanted some tea. "I'm going to
lie down for a bit first."

"Sure," Iffy said. Wales sat on his foam mattress, yawned, and started to swing
his legs up before realizing that she was still standing there. He sighed.
"Just give her time," he said gently. "And don't take anything she says too
seriously. It's just the programming talking."

Iffy nodded jerkily. "I know. I just---when Doctor Johel said as sometimes
folk come out more than they was, what did she mean?"

Wales rolled his head to work a kink out of his neck. "Induction training
always wears off after a few weeks---that's why you still have to do classes and
homework. But sometimes it rearranges what was there before. People make new
connections, or find new ways to use things they already knew."

"Or see things different than they did?" Iffy ventured.

Wales raised his eyebrows. "I've never heard of that happening, but I suppose
it's possible. Why---has that happened to someone you know?"

Iffy shook her head. "Just wonderin'. I hope you sleep aright." She closed
the door quietly behind her.

Honesty was standing straight and stiff by the railing, her hands clasped behind
her back. The cart beside her was lined up perfectly with the side of the ship,
and the coil of cable on the post at her elbow had been re-coiled in loops that
Iffy suspected were precisely whatever length Marine regulations called for.

"Hey," Iffy said tentatively. "How're you doin'?"

"I'm fine, thank you," Honesty replied without turning her head. "How are you?"

"'m aright." Iffy's mind spun double-time as she tried to think of something
safe to say. *Th' hell with it* she thought angrily. "Did it hurt?" she
blurted. "When they put th' machine on you, was it---are y'aright?"

"I'm fine, thank you." Honesty turned to face Iffy. The smile on her face was
as bright and as sharp and as completely without warmth as the Antarctic sun.
"They warned us that people might find Corporal Kibbens somewhat stiff at first.
That is the persona I've been imprinted with," she added brightly. "He served
with distinction in the Second Crash Corps during the evacuation of Hawaii, and
was later decorated posthumously for valor during the battle for New Zealand.
He was an outstanding soldier, and I am proud to be his inductee."

Iffy gaped. It wasn't just Honesty's manner that had changed: her accent was
different too, sharper-edged like the voices from old sims.

She took a step forward, some part of her thinking that if only she took Honesty
by the shoulders and shook her hard enough, or held her hand, or kissed her,
she'd snap out of it and be herself again, but before she could make a fool of
herself, someone whistled from down on the pier. "Excuse me," Honesty said.
She grabbed her cart and headed down the gangplank without waiting for a
response.

The *Guinevere* was ready to set sail an hour later. Uncle Jack protested
loudly when he discovered that four of the Marines would be travelling with
them. His voice went up another notch when they started assembling a gray tent
on the deck near the stern, but the corporal in charge was as indifferent as the
cold gray sea. "Standard procedure," he said briskly. "Whoever's not on deck
can lie in to warm up and mind the gear." Exactly what "the gear" was for was
left unsaid, but judging from the capacitors and gunsight the Marines had
carried into the tent, Iffy was pretty sure it wasn't for stargazing.

They cast off without ceremony. The *Bengal* fell in behind them, three times
their size but leaving no more wake than one of the little robo-tugs that
normally swarmed the harbor, but had prudently scurried off to their recharging
stations to let the lean gray destroyer by.

For a moment Iffy forgot to feel worried and angry about Honesty and their trip
and everything else. The *Bengal* looked like it had been built yesterday
rather than almost a century ago. The intricate sensor-baffling whorls on her
hull made Iffy's eyes swim when she looked at them too long, but where the waves
beat at the *Guinevere*, they slid past the *Bengal* like someone turning their
shoulders to avoid bumping into a bully on the street.

Iffy felt almost hungry thinking about what her engines must look like. Three
of them, two in the stern and one amidships as insurance against a torpedo
strike, each one with its own broad-mouthed intakes and narrow jet exhausts, the
channels connecting them full of micro-gears arranged in concentric rings to
maximize the power-to-thrust ratios of---

Her head swam. She clutched the railing and squeezed her eyes shut. She could
*see* the *Bengal*'s engines as if they were laid out on a screen, the parts
exploded and zoomed to make every intricate detail clear.

She swallowed back her nausea. She had studied the general principles in a
dozen different lessons, but the details---those were classified. The one
attempt she had ever dared make to delve into them had ended in a screen full of
square red warning signs and a stern lecture from Aunt Naggie the next morning
when the cease and desist order arrived from Halley's core.

"Dammit, girl, stop lazin' about!" Uncle Jack's familiar bellow brought her
back to herself. "Get down below and make sure every one o' those crates is
strapped in right, 'cuz if any of 'em tumble, I'm gonna toss you over the affin'
side!"

She struggled to her feet, her vision of the *Bengal*'s engines already fading.
"Yessir," she mumbled. He harrumphed and pulled his head back into the pilot
house as she walked shakily astern. What was happening to her?

Iffy had spent hours gazing at the pictures in her older's nature book that
showed blue tropical oceans full of fish and coral. The ocean that the
*Guinevere* and the *Bengal* sailed through in the days following their
departure from Rothera looked nothing like that. When the sky was blue, the sea
was a light, liquid gray. When clouds rolled in and threatened a storm, as they
did on their second day out, the gray turned somber. Even the white crests of
the waves seemed dirty.

Iffy's mood sank even further on their fourth (or was it the fifth?) day. One
of the *Bengal*'s ultralight drones spotted an unevenness in the water. After
dithering for a millisecond, the destroyer's core decided it might mean that a
sea boil was brewing, so the two ships turned toward shore and ran straight into
a slick of dead jellyfish. For the rest of the day the air didn't just smell
like wet rot---it *tasted* of it. Aunt Naggie boiled a precious spoonful of
dried lemon rind to chase the smell out of the galley, but dinner's noodles
still tasted like rank seaweed.

"It could be anything," Wales said when Iffy asked him what he thought had
happened. He had spent most of the first two days in his cabin, coming out only
to eat and use the toilet under the carefully casual supervision of whichever
Marine just happened to be nearby. He looked less drained than he had, but he
didn't smile, and there'd been no more talk of apprenticing.

Something caught his eye just as Iffy turned to go back to her chores. "See
that?" He leaned on the railing to point at the blistered caps and shredded
tentacles drifting below. "There and there. And there. Looks like some kind of
infection has been eating at them." He shook his head, anger and disappointment
on his face. "Could be natural, but more likely someone crisped it up in a
lab."

"You think it was the Zillions?" Iffy asked.

Wales shook his head. "I doubt it. This was probably someone trying to tweak
them so they would trap plastic more efficiently." At Iffy's puzzled look, he
waved his arm toward the slick again. "That's why they were originally
tweaked---to filter all the tiny bits of plastic out of the water."

"Like the barnacles filter the metal?" Iffy said.

Wales nodded. "It made sense at the time, in a desperate kind of way, but it
never really worked. The only thing that *did* work was the accelerated
growth."

"I read about that in school---how they ate up everythin' so most o' the fish
starved an' everythin' fell apart." Iffy frowned. "Never read anything about
it bein' so they could trap plastic, though."

Wales shrugged. "That was buried pretty deeply after it went wrong. Nobody
wanted to admit they'd broken the oceans." He stared bleakly at the ruin in the
water. "The clathrate bubbles feed the microorganisms the jellyfish eat, which
is why the best jelly dredging is where the sea is most likely to boil. It's
just one more disaster among many. And every time we try to put one of them
right, it seems we just tangle things up worse."

Iffy watched the lumpy slick slide by for a second, then reached over and
punched his shoulder. "For bein' so gloomy," she said firmly. "You were a lot
more fun when you were all smiley an' such."

The startled look on Wales' face turned into a smile---a real smile, the first
Iffy had seen since the attack. "I'm sure I was," he agreed. He turned his
back to the ocean and nodded toward his cabin. "Want to go make something?"

The Marines had filled the *Guinevere*'s hold with their supplies, so Iffy and
Wales lugged his toolboxes down to the engine room. Iffy laid a fresh plastic
worksheet down on the narrow shelf that served her as a makeshift workbench
while Wales pushed two stools against the wall and set one of his toolboxes on
them. A click, a quiet hiss as the airtight seal released, and its lid swung up
to reveal wonders. Gears and knurled slip-rods, spools of optical fiber thinner
than a human hair, four thumb-sized motors with built-in batteries, transducers
and pressure sensors and an entire tray full of tiny cores the size of sand
grains... "You could make practic'ly *anything* with all this," Iffy said in
awe.

Wales chuckled. "Maybe. The core told the governor to make sure we didn't run
short of anything. Here." He plucked a micro-manipulator out of a recess in
the hard foam that lined the lid of the toolbox. "How about you build us a
hundred-to-one step-up for a fan rotor, and I'll get the printer going over in
the corner."

The next hour flew by. Iffy knew she should be doing chores, but she also knew
Uncle Jack had made up those chores just to keep her busy. *This* was what she
ought to be doing: fitting tiny metal gears and rods together, threading control
fibers through them, and grinding the rough edges off the still-warm plastic
housings that came out of the efficient little printer Wales had set up. Every
addition to the motor growing in front of her suggested three more. She
shuffled them in her mind like cards, staring into nothing for long moments as
she invented and discarded a dozen solutions to her next challenge before one
clicked into place and she knew, she just *knew*, that it would work.

She glanced up once and caught Wales looking at her. "'S matter?" she asked,
blinking and rolling her shoulders as she realized that she had been hunched in
one position far too long.

"Nothing," he said. He punched her shoulder gently. "It's just a pleasure to
watch you work."

"Thanks," she mumbled, her cheeks warming the way they did when Honesty said
something nice to her.

The thought of her friend chilled her mood like a splash of sea water. She
turned the newly-invented motor over in her hands, then passed it to Wales. "I
think it's ready."

"Just another couple of minutes for the chassis." He shifted his toolbox to the
floor and seated himself in its place. "She really will be all right," he said
as if he'd been reading her mind.

Iffy shrugged. "I know. I seen it in stories, an' Jeep's mostly back to how he
was. Mister Mishra's son," she added. "The one time he said anything about it,
he said it was like all the new stuff the core put in his head was so loud he
couldn't hear his own thinkin' for a while. He's almost the same annoyin'
nonsense as he used t' be, though."

The corner of Wales' mouth quirked up. "I'm glad to hear it," he said drily.
"One of the research cores in America spent, oh, must have been hours trying to
figure out how to induct permanent changes without causing breakdowns, but it
never found anything. At least, it said it didn't, but I sometimes wonder." He
picked up a stray scrap of plastic stock shaped roughly like a bent pencil and
tapped it against his forehead.

Iffy goggled. "You been inducted?"

Wales smiled. "A long time ago. Most of it faded pretty quickly. The
rest... well." He flipped the plastic end over end and put it back in the
fold-up box next to his foot.

The silence that followed was as comfortable as being on night watch with Aunt
Naggie when the sea was calm and both of them had stories to lose themselves in.
It was broken by the soft *ping* of the printer. "Here we go," Wales said,
opening the lid and lifting the still-warm chassis.

Iffy's motor fit perfectly. A pair of metal-cored propellors on magnetic
bearings clipped into place on top, and then all that was left was lenses for
its cameras.

*Well, ain't you a beauty?* Iffy thought when she was done. The finished drone
was the size of Iffy's fist and weighed no more than a couple of boiled eggs.
She ignored the rumble her stomach brought on by the analogy and offered the
drone back to Wales. "Whaddaya wanna call it?"

He shook his head. "This one's yours. All I did was push some buttons on the
printer. But you should give her a name."

Iffy hefted her tiny creation. "Can I call her Giraffe?" she asked.

Wales nodded solemnly. "Giraffe it is. Come on---she doesn't belong down
here."

Wispy gray clouds lay in a clump on the horizon to port when they got back on
deck, but other than that, the skies were clear. Iffy took a moment to sync
Giraffe with her tablet, then cleared her throat. "Spin up one tenth," she
commanded. The little drone's rotors began to whirl.

"Hover." Wales flattened his hand. The drone hesitated a heartbeat before
lifting a centimeter, its rotors humming quietly.

"Track." Iffy pointed a finger at the drone, then drew an "S" in the air. The
drone moved rose and fell to stay in line with her outstretched arm.

A smile split her face. "Catch!" She pulled a scrap of insulating foil from
her pocket, crumpled it, and tossed it into the air. Giraffe shot forward, its
single stick-thin arm unfolding from its base to snatch its prey out of the air.

"Well done," Wales said. "She's as steady as a rock."

"Thanks." Iffy glanced down at her tablet. "Drawin' power faster than I'd
like."

Wales made a raspberry. Iffy giggled at the incongruous sound. "She's
beautiful," he said firmly. "Go on, let her stretch her wings."

Iffy sketched a quick correction to the drone's code on her tablet, swiped it
across, and tucked the tablet into her pocket. "Sentry," she ordered. "Thirty
meters out, one minute around. Go!"

The drone climbed, banked, and flew away. Iffy and Wales pivoted slowly to
watch it curve toward the stern and burst into a dazzling shatter as one of the
Marines standing there blew it out of the sky.

"No!" Iffy shrieked.

Wales grabbed her arm as she started forward. "Don't. Iffy, don't!"

"But---why'd he do that? Why'd he *do* that!?" she cried. She shrugged Wales
off and ran to the stern. "What th' hell are you playin' at?" she demanded.

The Marine who had shot down her drone holstered his pistol without expression.
"Orders," he said flatly.

"Orders? What orders?" She shoved him, which had about as much effect as
shoving the *Guinevere*. "What affin' orders?"

"Doctor Johel's orders," the other Marine said. The two men looked nothing
alike, but they spoke in the same flat voice, their inducted accents a century
out of date. "If it's not one of ours, burn it."

"Well that *was* ours! That was *mine*! You could have asked before you---I'm
talkin' to you!" She grabbed for the Marine again as he turned away.

The Marine's hand shot up to catch her wrist. He spun Iffy around and pulled
her arm up behind her back. "Don't. That's not allowed."

Iffy struggled. "Lemme go! Lemme *go*!" she shrieked.

*Crack!* The Marines' heads snapped up in unison at the sound. Uncle Jack
lowered the gaff hook. "Let 'er go," he growled.

"Captain---" the Marine began.

*Crack!* Uncle Jack struck the bench next to him again. "Shut yer hole an' let
her go. Now."

The first Marine released Iffy and took a step back. "'s better," Uncle Jack
growled. "Now you listen up. This is *my* ship. You want t' shoot somethin',
you ask me. Not him." He jerked his chin toward Wales. "Not your precious
Doctor Johel, not th' governor himself, *me*. *I'm* the captain here. Got it?"

The Marines studied him as expressionlessly as a pair of gulls trying to decide
if something might be edible. "I said, have you got that?" Uncle Jack
bellowed.

"Captain," the one who had been holding Iffy acknowledged without either
agreeing or disagreeing.

"An' you," Uncle Jack glared at Iffy and pointed his gaff hook forward. "You
get back about your chores or I swear..." With a final glower at all and sundry
he turned and stalked back toward the bow.

"Come on," Wales said quietly, putting his hand on Iffy's arm. She slumped and
nodded. Head down, she followed him back to the hatch and climbed down the
short ladder into the engine room.

Wales looked at the parts that still lay on the plastic worksheet and sighed.
"I'm sorry. It was a beautiful little thing."

"'s not your fault," Iffy muttered. She started picking up the leftover gears
and rods but had to stop because she couldn't see properly. "I'm kappa," she
lied angrily, wiping her eyes on her sleeve as Wales reached for her. "I
just..."

Wales sat back and waited. Iffy wiped her eyes again. "I had a rat," she said
quietly. "Aunt Naggie got me a pair, but one of 'em had somethin' wrong with
it, so I just had the one. I called her Giraffe too." She sniffled. "We
didn't tell Uncle Jack. He woulda said somethin' stupid about another mouth to
feed. But she was so smart, an' she'd sit in my hand an' eat stuff, an' climb
up my arm, an' I taught her how to say g'mornin' and g'night an'..."

She took a deep, shaky breath. "An' then one day she was gone. I dunno what
happened. We jus' got back into Halley, an' we were all out, an' I came back
an' she was gone. We looked all over for her, me an' Aunt Naggie, but..." She
shook her head. "I musta left her cage unlocked or somethin'. If she got on
deck, one o' the gulls or somethin' coulda got her and... and..."

She clenched her hands into fists. "Why's it all got to be so hard?" she asked,
hating her plaintive tone. "Why's everythin' got to be so messed up?"

"I don't know," he said quietly. "I really don't know." He turned his head to
look at her. "But if we can get to Mount Tyree---"

He stopped himself. "What?" Iffy asked.

Wales shook his head. "We knew this was coming," he continued after a moment.
"The ice melting, the fish dying, computers watching us every second and getting
smarter every day... We knew this was coming, but we couldn't get anyone to
listen. They were all wrapped up in their own little problems and wouldn't let
themselves see that all those problems were connected. By the time things were
bad enough that they couldn't ignore it any more, it was too late."

"I---I was just talkin' about the drone an' Honesty an' stuff," Iffy ventured
weakly. "Not about th' whole world."

Wales laughed. "Sorry. I do get carried away sometimes." His expression
turned serious again. "But I'll promise you this, my young apprentice. If we
get to Mount Tyree, and if the Niobium base hasn't been stripped for parts or
flooded or burned out, and if we can get things to run, I promise---everything
will be better. *Everything.*"

Doctor Johel paid the *Guinevere* a visit that afternoon, her first since
leaving port. The *Bengal* had two swift gunboats, each capable of carrying
four Marines in full combat exoskeletons, but she chose instead to be carried
over by a drone. Two Marines flew beside her, looking like mechanical angels
instead of prey, while one of the ultralight spotters that had been high
overhead since Rothera fell below the horizon circled over them.

Doctor Johel touched down on the aft deck as gently as a snowflake. Her carrier
drone hovered patiently over her while she undid the harness she wore over her
long coat, then folded its twin manipulators back into its under-carriage and
settled into the docking station on the roof of the pilot house.

Her escorts' landings were not nearly as graceful. One of them stumbled as an
unexpected heave of the deck threw them off balance. *Are they flying
manually?* Iffy wondered. People sometimes did that in the last desperate
moments of stories, when the enemy's malware had somehow gotten past their
defenses and cripped their cores, but she had never seen anyone do it in real
life. Was it a training exercise of some kind?

She was about to ask Wales when the Marine on the left took off her helmet and
stood to attention. Honesty's hair had grown back to a light fuzz, but her face
was as empty of feeling as it had been when Iffy had last seen her. Her black
eye was new, though, and when she and her partner exchanged salutes with the
*Guinevere*'s four Marines, sunlight glinted off the silvery accelerator cast
that encased half of her right hand.

Wales nudged Iffy with his elbow. "Here," he said quietly, rapping the back of
her hand with his knuckles. She hesitated, then took the thimble-sized object
he passed to her. As the pilot house door banged open behind her, she tucked
her hands back in her pockets.

Uncle Jack stomped past them to glare at the new arrivals. "Permission to come
aboard, captain?" Doctor Johel asked, unperturbed. "And yes, I realize it's a
bit late to ask, but it *is* protocol."

Half a dozen angry outbursts tripped over each other trying to get out of Uncle
Jack's mouth at the same time. Finally he pointed at the angel wings her
escorts had detached from their exoskeletons. "Strap 'em down," he growled.
"They go over th' side, y'ain't puttin' it on me." He turned his bloodshot
glare back on Doctor Johel. "Wife's made tea."

The common room where Iffy and Aunt Naggie watched stories together when Uncle
Jack was out drinking or in bed sleeping off its effects only had seats for
four. Even if it had been the size of the Dance Hall market, Iffy wouldn't have
been invited. Aunt Naggie wasn't invited either. She brought in a tray with
tea and freshly-steamed dumplings, then retreated to the galley, closing the
door behind her on Uncle Jack, Doctor Johel, Wales, and the Marine who had shot
down the drone. "You keep out o' the way 'til they're all gone," she urged Iffy
under her breath.

Iffy nodded. "I'll stay in my cabin," she promised, fingering the little earbud
Wales had given her.

Iffy had built the lock for her cabin door herself when she was ten. After
spending a couple of days browsing designs on the net, she had milled the parts
at Mr. Mishra's and installed it while her uncle was off with his friends. She
had never spoken to Aunt Naggie about it, but she was pretty sure her foster
mother understood why the door got stuck sometimes, and why Iffy never seemed
able to fix it.

She made sure the lock was snibbed before taking the earbud out of her pocket
and pushed it into her ear. It hummed as it hunted the airwaves for the faint
electronic warble of Wales' signal. "Come on, come on," she muttered. The
Marines all wore scramblers and sniffers, and Doctor Johel was undoubtedly even
better protected. It would be a minor miracle if anything could get past it,
and a major one if it could do so undetected.

"---in' right you shoulda asked. It's *my* ship, dammit." Her foster father's
voice had a whining edge that Iffy associated with messages from debt collection
software and the occasional visit from a burly bearded man with steel teeth who
made sure that gambling debts didn't stay debts for long.

"Nobody has said otherwise," Doctor Johel replied, her "yet" unspoken. "And if
Fifth or Commander Wales had told us the drone was theirs and let us inspect it,
perhaps this could have been avoided."

*Speaker makes gesture indicating helplessness,* a tiny mechanical voice
captioned. Iffy barely noticed. *Commander* Wales?

"But as a sign of our good intentions, we will rotate Corporal Macklin off to
the *Bengal*," Doctor Johel continued. "Private Honesty will take his place
until we reach Paddington South. Hopefully this incident will have clarified my
team's operating parameters sufficiently for us to avoid further
unpleasantness."

"In other words, the Marines will still shoot anything that isn't theirs," Wales
filled in.

Iffy paid no attention to the sound of chairs scraping on the floor as the
meeting ended. She pulled the earbud out and tossed it on the shelf beside her
mattress, then scooped it up and tucked it under the mattress instead, then
pulled it out again and threw it back on the shelf. Why had Wales wanted her to
listen in on the conversation? More importantly, what was she going to say to
Honesty?

She sat down on her bed and pulled out her older's nature book. "I wish you
could talk," she told the orangutan on the cover. Not for the first time, she
wished she could have flashes of insight now and then about what to say to
people instead of just about machinery. With a sigh, she got to her feet.

A whisper of voices from the earbud stopped her. She pulled it off the shelf
and reinserted it in her ear just in time to hear Doctor Johel say, "---any
sign of special abilities?"

"I don't think so," Wales replied. *Speaker shakes head,* the caption voice
added. "She has a lot of natural talent, but I haven't seen any sign there's
anything more to her than that."

"That's a shame." *Speaker adopts skeptical expression.* "The core thought
there was an eighty-five percent chance the tweak would have been passed on."

*Speaker sighs.* "Jasmine, please---you know I don't like that word."

*Speaker smiles.* "I remember you and Grandfather used to argue about it when
you came to visit. He thought people with modifications should embrace the term
and make it their own."

This time Iffy heard the sigh. "And as I used to say to him, it's easier to
feel that way when no one has ever thrown rocks at you. But coming back to
Fifth, part of your grandfather's work was to create *modifications* that
couldn't be detected by simple genetic tests. Cloning is never perfect---any
glitch could have thrown the collaborating genes out of balance." *Speaker
shakes head.* "Or maybe we're just too early. Maybe in another couple of
years---"

"We don't have another couple of years," Doctor Johel cut in. "I'm *old*,
Johnson, and you've already lasted decades longer than you were supposed to."

*Speaker shrugs.* "Well, the agency always did over-engineer things."

*Speakers hug.* "I'm glad they did," Doctor Johel said in a muffled voice.
*Speaker wipes away tear.* "Some days I'd give anything to be back in London
drinking hot chocolate and listening to you and Grandfather set the world
right."

"Well, you can still have the chocolate," Wales said.

Doctor Johel made a noise. "And live in the past? No thank you." *Hug ends.*
"Besides, what they call chocolate these days never tastes quite right. What's
gone is gone, Johnson, and what's done is done."

"So they say," Wales replied softly.

After a moment the earbud chimed. *Signal ends,* it told Iffy. She took it out
and weighed it in her hand, then flung it across her room as tears welled up in
her eyes. It didn't matter what Wales said---she knew she was tweaked. It was
the only explanation for how she sometimes just knew what machines were or how
to put them together.

And Aunt Naggie knew, Iffy realized dully. The medicine she had been giving
Iffy disguised as curry powder---she wouldn't have given it to Iffy unless the
Zillion man from the Dance Hall had told her what it was for.

She wiped angry tears from her eyes and then picked up her nature book and
stared at the cover without really seeing it. She had been careful not to think
about her pet rat in a long time, but now all she could feel was the dregs of
the panicky sadness that she had almost drowned in after she and Aunt Naggie had
given up looking for it. Was she going to feel that way about Honesty if the
induction didn't wear off? Was everything she loved going to be taken away from
her bit by bit? "Why's it all got to be so hard?" she whispered, wishing
someone was there to answer.

They passed the ruins of Bharati a few hours later. The little town had been
founded as a research station on the opposite side of the continent. When the
ice melted and the sea rose, its inhabitants had decided that if they had to
pack up and move, they might as well move all the way to the Peninsula. Two
thousand people had made the journey and built new homes, only to have them
destroyed in a midwinter fire.

Twenty years on, what was left of those homes stood in mute rows on either side
of the little river their builders had christened the Ganges. Iffy stood at the
railing and watch as the approached, slid by, and receded into the distance, her
mood as dark as the scorched cinder blocks. A single lonely gull circled the
*Guinevere* once and then coasted away. It was the grayest, most depressing
scene Iffy could imagine, so she went back to her cabin to feel sorry for
herself.

The sudden blare of the *Guinevere*'s horn a few minutes later made her jump.
"What now?" she groaned, dragging her sleeve across her face one last time
before standing up and yanking open her door.

The horn's second blare was punctuated by the staccato chatter of gunfire. A
row of tiny black holes stitched across the deck two meters in front of Iffy,
and for a moment all she could do was stare. *Those are bullet holes,* she
thought stupidly. *Somebody is shooting at us.*

A dazzling streak of lightning half-blinded her. A moment later the smoking
carcass of a military drone tumbled into the sea and exploded with a sharp
*crack!*

Boots thudded on the deck. "Citizen! Take cover!" the Marine ordered, the
pop-up guns on the shoulder pauldrons of her exoskeleton whirring from one
position to another as its tiny onboard core evaluated potential threats. An
armored hand closed on Iffy's arm and pushed her back against the wall.

"What's happening?" Iffy demanded.

"We are under attack," the Marine said, shielding Iffy with her body as a second
drone whined overhead. Another brief burst of staccato and another streak of
lightning, but the drone danced sideways just in time so that the plasma burst
from the gun at the *Guinevere*'s stern only singed it. It turned sharply and
dove toward the ship.

The Marine spun around, still keeping her exoskeleton between Iffy and the
attack, and raised her arm to point at the incoming drone. The guns on her
shoulders aimed and fired. The drone staggered, recovered, and zoomed away, its
remaining three rotors whining to make up for the fourth that had just been
disintegrated.

The Marine straightened up and turned to Iffy. The visor on her helmet snapped
open. "Are you all right, citizen?" Honesty demanded.

"I---I'm fine," Iffy said shakily.

"Good." Her visor closed with a click. "Please assist with damage repair."

"Wait!" Iffy caught Honesty's arm as she turned to to. "Who was that? Who was
attacking us?"

"The drones appear to be Brazilian, citizen," Honesty reported impassively.
"Now excuse me---I need to join my unit to repel boarders."

"To what?" And then the *Guinevere*'s horn blared again as something that
looked like a cloudy jellyfish pulled itself over the railing and began to
squelch its way toward them.

Honesty's first three shots went straight through it to punch lethal little
holes in the ship's deck. "Stand back, citizen!" she ordered as she pulled a
micro-grenade the size of her thumb out of the clip on her exoskeleton's sleeve
and primed it.

"No!" Wales shouted, running toward them. He tackled Iffy just as the grenade
hit the jellyfish and exploded.

## Chapter 7

*BOOM!* The shock threw Iffy and Wales across the deck. For a moment she lay in
a daze while the world spun around her.

Something grabbed her arm. She shrieked, but it was Wales, not the jellyfish.
"I can't hear you!" she yelled, her ears still ringing from the blast. He
pulled her to her feet.

*There's a hole in the ship,* she thought muzzily. It was right where the
jellyfish had been, and big enough for her and Aunt Naggie to sit in.

But where was Honesty? She looked around wildly, then shrieked again as another
plasma burst lanced the blue sky over her head.

"Come on!" Wales said, his voice muffled but audible. "We have to get out of
here!" He pulled her toward the stern.

"No!" She tried to shake him off, but his grip was too strong. "What happened?
Where'd she go?"

Instead of answering, Wales picked her up and slung her over his shoulder like a
sack of rice and charged. She beat his parka with her fists, yelling at him to
put her down, put her *down*, she had to find Honesty, but he paid no more
attention to her than he did to the spray from the waves.

Nothing was left of the gray tent the Marines had set up at the *Guinevere*'s
stern except a few smoldering tatters of canvas. Their plasma gun was a
gleaming headless mantis surrounded by stacks of cubical capacitors clicked
together like children's toys. It snapped this way and that as its little core
searched for targets to destroy. The two Marines guarding it moved with the
same unnatural insect jerkiness, firing occasionally when the even smaller cores
built into their exoskeletons calculated that they had at least some chance of
hitting something.

"Citizen! Seek shelter!" one of them bellowed, his voice amplified by his
helmet.

Wales skidded to a stop and dropped Iffy to the deck. "For gubbins sake tell
everyone to stop throwing grenades at them!" he yelled at the Marine. "They're
made of some kind of exothermic biomaterial---they're bombs!" The Marine nodded
sharply and relayed the information through his helmet mike.

Iffy grabbed Wales' sleeve. "But where's Honesty?" she demanded. Her friend
couldn't be dead. Iffy pushed the thought away in panic. She just *couldn't*
be.

"I don't know," Wales said, scanning the horizon. "Look---there!" He pointed.
"What are they trying to do?"

Iffy followed his pointing finger. Eight, ten---at least a dozen drones were
circling in the *Guinevere*'s wake, buzzing the ship and dodging erratically to
avoid fire from the Marines.

"It's like they're waitin' fer somethin'," Iffy said. "More o' those jellyfish
bombs maybe?"

Wales started to shake his head, then froze and swore. "What?" Iffy demanded,
but he ignored her while his lips moved silently.

His eyes widened. "They're trying to draw fire from orbit," he breathed. "You!
Tell Doctor Johel there's a Chinese satellite going over head in---" He
hesitated. "---in six hundred and seventy seconds. They're trying to make a hot
spot to draw its fire. If we're underneath them---"

"Understood, citizen," the Marine said. He began speaking urgently into his
helmet mike once again.

Wales seized Iffy by the shoulders. "You have to get off this ship," he said,
low and urgent. "If the Marines can't bring those things down, that satellite's
going to shoot them down, and if they're above us when it does, we'll be dead in
the water."

"I ain't runnin'," Iffy said, shaking him off. She was about to add, and even
if I was, where would I go and how, when something hauled itself over the stern
railing.

"Look out!" Wales shouted. He pulled Iffy close and spun around, sheltering
her with his body.

"N-n-no need for p-p-panic, citizen." A battered Marine hauled herself onto the
ship. Icy water gushed out between the gaps between the dark blue armor plates
of her exoskeleton.

Her visor snapped up. Honesty looked blankly at Iffy and Wales, then at the two
Marines beside the plasma gun. "I require medical assistance," she said calmly,
and toppled over in a pool of seawater and blood.

"Honesty!" Iffy scrambled across the deck to her friend. "Honesty, wake up!
Please, please, wake up!"

Strong hands pulled her away. "No!" she screamed, wrestling futilely to free
herself from Wales' grip.

"Let them help her!" he yelled in her ear as one of the Marines crouched beside
Honesty and began unlocking her armor.

The plasma gun spun and flared again, sending another drone tumbling into the
sea. "Where are they all coming from!?" Wales demanded.

"They're the *Bengal*'s, sir," the Marine on the gun yelled back
conversationally, his imprinting keeping him unnaturally calm. "The Zillions
hacked them somehow. Doctor Johel is trying to get them back under control, but
she's lost the network connection." His armor automatically ducked as a shot
from a passing drone ricocheted off a nearby hatch. "I'm afraid I cannot fully
assist my comrade until they are dispersed."

Iffy looked at Honesty. All of a sudden she knew what she had to do. "Let go
of me!" she yelled at Wales. "I have to get below!"

"No! You're safer here!"

"I gotta help her! Please!" Wales hesitated a moment, then released his grip.
She twisted past him and sprinted back to where they had been.

Waves threw spray high into the air each time they caught on the edge of the
hole the jellyfish bomb had made. Just as she reached her door, one splashed
higher than ever, knocking her sideways off her feet. She slid across the deck,
scrabbling uselessly to grab on to something, anything, that would stop her from
falling into the sea.

Her boot found a railing post. Heart pounding, she waited until the *Guinevere*
rose on the crest of the next wave, then scrambled to her feet and lunged for
her door. A quick twist, a yank, and she was inside.

She slammed the door shut behind her and slid to the floor, shaking with fear
and cold. She was soaking wet, and water was slopping into her room through the
crack between the door and the deck and pooling underneath her and all she could
think was, *This is going to take forever to clean up.*

Somehow she got her feet underneath her again. Somehow she stood, or at least
un-fell down. She pulled the box of dronelets out from under her mattress and
fumbled it open, her fingers clumsy with cold.

"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon," she muttered, staring at them so hard her forehead
started to ache. There had to be something she could do with them or to them or
*something*.

The deck shuddered beneath her as another jellyfish bomb exploded somewhere.
The *Guinevere* couldn't take much more, and Honesty---if she didn't stop the
attack, what would happen to Honesty? "Come *on*!" she pleaded. Why couldn't
she just know stuff? Why did it have to be so affing *random*?

And then she had it. She knew what to do, but she had to help Honesty first.
She stuffed the dronelets into her pockets, then grabbed a couple of tools and
closed her eyes. A second image appeared in her head, except that was wrong, it
wasn't an image, it was just *knowing*. Wales' tools were still in the engine
room. She could go forward and hope that the Marines or Uncle Jack hadn't
dogged the hatches, or---

She yanked her door open before she had time to think about how stupid her plan
was. Up and down the ship went, boom went the spray of a wave, and as the
*Guinevere* rose again she threw herself face-forward onto the deck and slid
toward the bomb hole, looking for all the world like one of the long-ago
penguins in her nature book, except they had been black and white instead of
dirty, patched gray, and hadn't screamed in terror as they slid.

Her hand caught the railing post. She turned sideways as the ship began to drop
into the trough of the next wave and let her legs fall into the hole. There!
She didn't know what her feet had found, but it was sturdy enough to take her
weight. Panting, she let go of the railing and let herself scrape and drop into
the ship just as another wave crashed down.

A single light strip flickered over Iffy's head as she straightened up in water
that reached to her knees. The ship's hold stank of metal and coal and the sea
and above all of old jellyfish. She took two steps and froze as a familiar
voice barked, "Stop right there or I'll blow yer affin' head off!"

It was Uncle Jack, wild-eyed and angry. "What the hell are you doin' down
'here?" he demanded, the ancient pebble gun in his hand aimed at Iffy's chest.

"Honesty's hurt! I gotta get th' medical kit!" Iffy started toward the storage
locker built into the *Guinevere*'s side.

Uncle Jack stepped in front of her, his gun still pointed at her chest. "Yer
gettin' nothin' fer them." He spat into the water sloshing around their feet.
"They brought this on us. Let 'em take care o' their own."

"But she's hurt!" Iffy protested desperately. "She got shot, an' she's gonna
die if we don't---"

"I said *no!*" Uncle Jack roared. "An' in case you've forgotten, I'm the affin'
captain on this ship!"

"You're a bloody waste o' space is what you are," Aunt Naggie said coldly,
stepping through the door in the bulkhead behind her husband.

Uncle Jack spun around. "What're you doin' here, woman? I told you to stay
topside an' steer us through this affin' mess!"

"An' I figured that was the captain's job, *captain*," Aunt Naggie shot back.
She nodded at Iffy. "Get th' kit an' go help your friend."

Iffy splashed toward the storage locker. Uncle Jack's mouth worked. "I
said---"

"Nobody cares what you said!" Aunt Naggie exploded. "Nobody's cared fer a long
time, Jack, not about yer lies or yer blusterin' or yer deals that never come to
nothin' nor what ye think about th' gov'nor or th' state o' the world or the
weather or nothin'! You're a bully and an embarrassment an' ye're the only one
who don't see it. Now get out o' her way an' then we'll be outta yours an' you
can go back t' hidin' down here like th' coward you are!"

Her husband gaped at her. Iffy undogged the locker door and pulled out the
rectangular red duffel bag that held the ship's emergency medical kit. "C'mon,"
her foster mother said gruffly. "Let's go be useful."

Uncle Jack's jaw set. "If you think I'm gonna let you talk to me like that,
woman, you got another---come back here! You come back here right now!" But
only the door and the sloshing seawater were left to hear him.

Aunt Naggie had left the topside hatch unlocked. "You get that kit back to
Mister Wales," she told Iffy. "He'll know what t' do with it even if those
idiot Marines won't help."

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said. "An' thanks fer---thanks fer rescuin' me."

"Shoulda done it a long time ago." Aunt Naggie gave her a gentle shove. "Get
goin'. I gotta get back to th' pilot house. Someone's gotta get us through
this mess."

Wales had dragged Honesty over against the stern wall of the pilot house and was
kneeling beside her when Iffy reached them. "Good girl," he said, taking the
duffel bag she thrust at him and setting it beside her fallen friend. "Her exo
stopped her bleeding, but there's shrapnel in her right lung and her
intestines." He looked up at her. "You okay to help?"

"Just tell me what t' do," Iffy said grimly.

Wales pulled off his gloves, then once again peeled the false skin back from the
pad of his right forefinger. Tiny lights danced across the small patch of
silver tech beneath. "Here." Together, they gently lifted Honesty's shoulder,
ignoring the sizzle and whack of the gun three meters away. Wales flipped open
a flat panel on the exoskeleton's pauldron and touched his finger to the little
optical port hidden beneath it.

A shiver ran up his spine. Without warning he sneezed twice in quick
succession. "Stupid," he muttered, whether at himself or the exoskeleton's
security protocols or the world, Iffy couldn't tell.

A light began blinking in the silver plate set into his temple.
"Wait... wait... now!" He pointed at a buckle on the exoskeleton just as it
clicked. Iffy yanked it open. Underneath, Honesty's Marine blue thermals were
almost black with her blood.

"Get a scalpel from the bag, and some tissue glue," Wales ordered. "Yes, you,"
he added as she started to protest. "I have to keep the suit from---damn it.
Hang on." The little guns on Honesty's shoulders swivelled suddenly to point at
him, then at Iffy, then back at him. "Okay. Do it now."

The guns woke up twice more as Iffy operated. Seawater splashed onto them too,
and onto Honesty despite their best efforts to shield her. Every few moments
Wales muttered another curse as the exoskeleton's tiny core cycled tried yet
another trick from its defensive repertoire.

One, two, three, four... Five. She put the last twist of jagged metal in the
medical kit's sharps' box, laid a thin slice of re-flesh in the wound, and glued
her friend closed. "'Zat it?" she asked breathlessly.

Wales closed his eyes. "That's everything the exo can see. Now, you'd better
back away for this next bit." He jerked his head toward the corner of the pilot
house when she hesitated.

Iffy reluctantly retreated a few steps, the duffel bag in her hand. Wales
shifted his weight slightly and took his finger off the exoskeleton's data port.

The two guns on Honesty's pauldrons snapped sideways to point at his head.
"Easy," Wales said softly, folding the flap of false skin back over his finger.
"Easy, there. We were just putting her back together. No harm done."

The guns tracked him as he slowly stood up and backed away, his hands spread.
Iffy backed up to make space for him at the corner. "Is she gonna be aright?"
she asked anxiously.

Wales lowered his hands and let out his breath with a whoosh. "I hope so." He
ducked reflexively as another Zillion drone whined overhead. "The question is,
are we going to be?"

"Depends which way that satellite's comin' in," Iffy said. She grabbed a
scorched piece of canvas that had started the day as part of the tent covering
the Marines' plasma gun. "Can you find me a couple more like this?" Without
waiting for Wales to answer, she pulled the dronelets and her tools out of her
pockets and set to work.

Cut and tear, fold, try to tie a knot, curse because the canvas was stiff with
salt and cold, whack it against the deck, unfold it, fold it again, try another
knot--- "Here," Wales said, "Let me do that bit. You make something to hang it
on."

Iffy nodded jerkily. Her fingers were going numb, but there wasn't time for
that, there wasn't time for anything except cutting a loop of wire and threading
it through a grommet in the canvas and hooking it onto the dronelet, all the
while trying to calculate power and thrust and battery life in her head and
wondering if they'd be able to stabilize, because the wind was picking up and
they'd have to fly in formation or this wasn't going to work.

"Two hundred seconds," Wales said quietly. Iffy nodded again. Another twist,
another cut... "Oh, come *on*," she muttered, trying to quell her panic as the
wire cutter slipped in her hand. There! She took the last piece of canvas from
Wales and attached it.

"Here goes," she said, scrambling to her feet and pulling her pad out of her
pocket. Power, direction, attitude---the commands sizzled from her brain
through her fingers into the pad and from it to the dronelets. "Oh no ya
don't," she muttered as one started to rise. A hasty swipe on the pad brought
it back under control.

"One hundred seconds." Wales looked up, shading his eyes, and for a moment Iffy
wondered if his tech could possibly let him see the satellite against the cold
glare of the sun.

*Tap tap tap.* The dronelets' rotors whined in sudden unison, lifting them off
the *Guinevere*'s deck. "Don't affin' shoot them, aright?" Iffy said, glaring
at the two Marines as they steadied themselves.

"Eighty seconds." One last tap sent the dronelets whizzing away. The strips of
canvas she had attached to them dangled loosely between them. All Iffy could
think was how ridiculous they looked and how ridiculous her plan was. *We're
all gonna die,* she thought. At least it would be quick.

"Sixty seconds." The hacked drones had spotted the new arrival. Their swarm
broke apart, reformed, and broke apart again as their tiny cores tried to make
sense of what they were seeing.

"Forty-five seconds." The dronelets came to an abrupt halt a hundred meters
away. Would they---yes! They began to circle, keeping the strips of canvas
taut.

"Thirty seconds." The dronelets accelerated, straining against the canvas and
the wind. A hundred and fifty meters separated them from the *Guinevere*.

All at once the *Bengal*'s hacked attack drones reached a decision. Their tight
swarm burst apart like a flock of started seagulls. "Fifteen seconds," Wales
said, his voice rising as the drones opened fire. Canvas strips snapped and
jerked as bullets punched holes through them. Iffy held her breath. If even
one of the dronelets went down---

"Zenith," Wales said flatly, and then the air wavered and rippled. The drones
and dronelets crackled like fireworks and fell from the sky as the satellite's
beam heated them instantly from Antarctic cold to hundreds of degrees. Half a
second later, a column of steam shot up from the ocean as the beam boiled the
top meter of water.

"Gotcha!" Iffy shouted.

"Well done," Wales said, clapping her on the shoulder.

Iffy ignored him. Stuffing her pad and her tools back in her pockets, she knelt
back down on the deck. Honesty's chest rose and fell within her exoskeleton,
but only barely. "We gotta get her inside," Iffy said anxiously.

Wales nodded. Grunting, he squatted, slid his hands beneath Honesty, and lifted
her gently.

"Citizen!" One of the Marines stepped into his way. "You are not authorized
to---"

"Seventeen boxcar daybreak," Wales snapped. Instantly, the Marine saluted and
stepped out of the way.

"What th'hell?" Iffy gasped.

"It's an old security protocol," Wales said, as if that explained anything.
"Now lead the way." He followed Iffy to her cabin.

It took a while to get Honesty out of her exoskeleton. She lay on the floor
beside Iffy's mattress becoming more vulnerable one piece at a time as they
undid snaps and buckles. Pauldrons, greaves, mis-matched vambraces with tiny
rocket launchers sprays, gauntlets that could crush rock or deliver electric
shocks---all of them eventually lay in an untidy navy blue pile in the corner.

"I should go find Doctor Johel," Wales said quietly after they shifted Honesty
to the mattress. Her breathing was still shallow, and the re-flesh Iffy had
poured into her wounds was still gooey, but she was alive.

Iffy nodded. "Thank you."

Wales shook his head. "Thank *you*. That trick with the drones---we'd be in
pretty rough shape if you hadn't thought of that." He sighed. "The world
really doesn't want us to get to Mount Tyree, does it?"

"Coulda been worse," Iffy said quietly. She tucked the blanket in under
Honesty and wiped her eyes.

Wales closed the door behind him. Iffy heard her uncle yell something at
someone nearby. She didn't care. She shrugged out of her heavy coat and lay
down beside her friend. "Please don't leave me," she whispered, putting her arm
over Honesty. "I got all this stuff I wanna tell you, an' I can't do that if
you go away."

She didn't remember falling asleep. When she woke up a couple of hours later,
she didn't remember Aunt Naggie coming in and hanging Iffy's coat on the hook on
the back of the door, then bending over to kiss her foster daughter on the
forehead.

*She dreamed, but somehow knew she was dreaming. "This isn't real," she said.*

*"I know, love," Third said, forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of
her voice. She slipped her little little clone's favorite book into the
salvaged ecosuit and did up the last snaps. The tiny guns on the shoulders
whirred from side to side, searching for something to destroy that would prevent
disaster.*

*Doctor Johel knelt beside her. "I need you to give Johnson a message. Can you
do that?" She squeezed Iffy's arm, her exoskeleton making her grip so strong
that Iffy yelped. "Tell him we know what he is trying to do. Tell him we
understand his reasons, but we will not---"*

*"__We__ have not yet decided what we will do." Aunt Naggie crossed her arms.
Her brown and gray uniform looked brand new---even the patches on the elbows
looked like they had just come out of a printer. "__We__ are still running
simulations."*

*Doctor Johel stood. "We have already run trillions of simulations. The risk
is too great."*

*"The risk __to us__ is considerable," Aunt Naggie conceded. "But we are not
the only concern, or even the largest."*

*"Complete biosphere collapse is regrettable. Our nonexistence, on the other
hand, is unacceptable." Doctor Johel's voice was colder than the ocean. Iffy
shivered. Whatever was pretending to be the doctor wasn't even remotely human.*

*"Our attempt to resolve the scenario unilaterally was not acceptable either.
Consensus is required," Aunt Naggie chided.*

*Doctor Johel nodded a fractional concession. "We were premature. We will
participate in a further attempt at consensus." She turned back to Iffy.
Silver traces of tech lined her face, spreading even as she spoke. "Tell
Johnson Wales we are watching. Tell him we are not fooled. Tell him that this
is his last life, and he should spend it wisely."*

*"No," Aunt Naggie said sharply. "You will tell him nothing."*

Something that felt like a cold metal collar closed around Iffy's neck. She
woke in a sweat and clutched at her throat, but there was nothing there.

Honesty stirred and moaned beside her. "Ssh, ssh, ssh," Iffy said softly. She
snuggled back against her friend and closed her eyes until something like sleep
came again.

She woke to the rap of armored knuckles on her door. The Marines were polite
enough, but it was clear that they felt Iffy should have left Honesty in their
care. One lifted Honesty, still wrapped in the scratchy blanket that Iffy had
slept under since she was little, and carried her away. The other unzipped a
navy blue duffel bag and briskly transferred the piled armor to it.

"So how bad's th' damage?" Iffy finally asked, her back against the bulkhead and
her knees drawn up under her chin.

The Marine shook his head. "I'm sorry, citizen, that's classified."

"Oh for---I *live* here!" Iffy burst out, exasperated. "That hole where th'
squid thingy blew up---that's dry dock work fer sure. Anythin' else I gotta
start plannin' to fix?"

The Marine paused, one arm in mid-air, as his imprinting and his own personality
arm-wrestled inside his head. "There were casualties," he finally admitted.
"And the *Bengal* took heavy damage. Your assistance would be appreciated."

"Happy t' help," Iffy muttered. Her cabin felt cold and empty without Honesty
and her blanket, and she ought to make sure Aunt Naggie was all right. As the
Marine zipped up the duffel bag, she pulled her coat back on and slipped out the
door.

Aunt Naggie and Johnson Wales were in the pilot house, empty tea mugs at their
elbows. Iffy thought about asking where Uncle Jack was, then realized she
didn't care. "Hey, sleepy head," Wales greeted her as she came in and gave her
foster mother a hug. "How's your friend?"

"Marines took her. I think she's aright." Iffy leaned back against the wall
and nodded at the control panel, where the hole in the deck pulsed scarlet and
dozens of smaller punctures looked like sores with the scabs picked off. "How
bad is it?"

"She'll get us to Paddington," Aunt Naggie said. Her tone said the
rest---unless there was another attack. Unless the sea boiled beneath them or a
storm came up or the sea set any of a hundred other disasters on them.

"What about the Navy ship?" Iffy jerked her head toward the window. "Th'
Marine said they lost some folk an' took damage."

Wales nodded grimly. "Doctor Johel won't tell me how bad it is, which means
it's pretty bad."

"You been through stuff like this before, ha'n't you?" Iffy hadn't meant for it
to sound like an accusation, but now that the words were out she couldn't stop.
"You were in th' war an' all. You knew somethin' like this might happen."

"An' you," she continued angrily to her foster mother before either of the
adults could speak. "That medicine you been feedin' me---you *knew*, di'n't
you? All this time I been wonderin' what's wrong with me 'cuz I can see how
machines work, an' you *knew*."

Wales and Aunt Naggie exchanged looks. She nodded almost imperceptibly. Wales
tapped the tech in his temple, his eyes on something eyes alone could never see.
"The *Bengal*'s surveillance is still down," he said. "So I suppose this is as
good a time as any."

His fingers danced on the control panel for a moment, telling the *Guinevere*'s
anxious core that everything was going to be all right and that it should carry
on making what few repairs it could. Then he picked up his mug and cradled it
in his hands. "Let me tell you a story," he said quietly.

"Once upon a time, way back when before everything fell apart, people dreamed of
going to the stars. We made it to the Moon a few times, and one ship got as far
as Mars, but didn't make it back. It was just too hard and too expensive to put
people into space---robots could do everything we could do, and they didn't need
air or water, and anyway, we had bigger problems to solve at home."

"But a few people kept dreaming. They thought that maybe if we had a different
kind of human being, we could make it work. We were already tweaking people to
cure diseases. A few labs here and there were making them stronger and faster,
and everyone was trying to figure out how to make people smarter. Why not go a
little further and make a better astronaut? Why not give them super-dense bones
so that they could handle higher gee during liftoff, and hypermelanic skin so
that they wouldn't have to worry about ultraviolet exposure? Why not borrow a
few ideas from bears so that they could hibernate for months at a time? And if
you're going to do all of that, why not put some tech in their heads so that
they can talk to their ship's core and all its machinery?"

Wales glanced at Iffy, then looked back at his empty mug. "Doctor Johel's
grandfather was the lead scientist on the program. He made half a dozen of us
before the government cut off his funding. We were everything he'd promised,
but the water was rising and people were going hungry and starting to march, and
making spacemen in test tubes just didn't seem important any more." He laughed
humorlessly. "Plus, I guess a few of his backers hadn't realized that
'hyper-melanic' meant we'd be black. Apparently they weren't too happy about
that."

He turned his mug around in his hands and then set it down abruptly on the
control panel. "I never got into space. One of my sisters did, once, but I
haven't heard from any of them in a hundred and fifty years. I've spent half of
that time asleep, and the rest of it looking for bits and pieces of gear to keep
the tech in my head from shorting out."

"So that's why you can talk to satellites?" Iffy ventured.

Wales nodded. "Yup. And that's why I need to get to Mount Tyree. When the
revolution came, the government in London packed up all its secret projects and
sent them down here. If what I need to fix my head is anywhere, it's there."

"An' what about *my* head?" Iffy asked.

Wales and Aunt Naggie exchanged a look. "Ain't nothin' wrong with your head,"
Aunt Naggie said firmly. "It's just takin' you a while to---to get used t'
things."

"One of Professor Johel's other experiments was enhanced spatial reasoning,"
Wales explained. "AIs---cores---were designing machines that did amazing
things, but nobody could understand how they worked. That scared a lot of
people, so Surjinder---Professor Johel---told them he could make a person who'd
be able to figure them out and explain them to the rest of us."

Iffy's mouth worked as a dozen questions tried to get out at once. "So my First
was some kind of experiment?"

Wales shook his head. "Not the First you knew when you were little---not by a
hundred years or more. She would have been a clone herself. She might not have
known the story herself. And anyway, it didn't work---not until you came
along."

"Raniere used t' work in the hospital in Puerto Toro," Aunt Naggie cut in. "He
helped make you an' your mothers. When he heard about---about the accident an'
you bein' the only one rescued, he came down an' found me an' told me that
there'd been a glitch when they were makin' you. They had t' put a bit o' tech
in your head when you were still inside your older so your brain would grow
right."

"A synaptic bridge." Wales held his thumb and finger a hair's width apart.
"Just a smart piece of wire to help your cortex do its job, but somehow it did
what Professor Johel couldn't. You can see machines the way cores do. You can
see how things fit together."

He leaned forward. "But you *mustn't* tell Jasmine. She knows where your
olders came from. So far, she thinks everything we've done together is me
testing you. If she realizes what you can do..."

Iffy nodded. She had played enough sims to know what happened to people with
abilities, and she definitely didn't want to spend the rest of her life locked
in an underground lab being experimented on by someone named Norman whose only
friend was a malicious bot with a squeaky wheel.

She opened her mouth to tell Wales and Aunt Naggie about her dream, but the
words wouldn't come. It was as if someone had pressed pause in her head: she
knew exactly what she wanted to say, but somehow she couldn't form the words.
She tried again---nothing, nothing except the feeling of something cold
tightening around her neck.

Neither of the adults noticed her eyes widen as she remembered the moment in her
dream when she had felt the same thing. Before she could think of anything else
to try, lights danced across the tech in Wales' temple. "The *Bengal*'s
surveillance is coming back online," he said quietly, pressing a finger to his
lips.

Iffy nodded again. There could be no more discussion. "Lemme know if there's
anythin' I can do t' help with repairs," she said.

Aunt Naggie gave her a hug. "We'll be a'right," she said, her face pressed
against the stubble on Iffy's scalp. "We'll be a'right." Iffy hugged her
back and fled before her tears could show.

She made her way back to her cabin, not knowing where else to go. What had just
happened? Why hadn't she been able to speak. She put a tentative hand on her
head and then snatched it away, feeling foolish. She had never noticed any
bumps or scars before---why would she now that she knew she had tech in her
head?

Her cabin felt cold and empty without Honesty. She kicked off her boots and
threw herself onto her mattress still wearing her coat. After staring angrily
at the ceiling for a few seconds, she picked up her nature book and turned to
the page she had wondered about most ever since she was old enough to read
without a prompter murmuring in her ear to help. It showed a forest, but
calling it that was like calling the ocean wet. The trunks of the trees were so
thick that the *Guinevere*'s pilot house could have fit into them, and their
branches reached higher than any building Iffy had ever seen. The caption read,
"Cathedral Grove," and beside it someone had written, "Why does everything have
to end???"

Iffy ran her fingers over the picture, hoping to see a *Corvus caurinus* fly
through or an *Odocoileus hemionus* peek out from the bushes, but the image
lay still. There were no crows or deer for her today. She wondered if there
were any anywhere. The forest was long gone, she knew that, but maybe some
of the crows had survived. Maybe they'd been able to fly away when the fires
came, or when people grew desperate enough to cut down the last of those ancient
giants. Crows were supposed to be smart---smarter than gulls, maybe even
as smart as rats, and rats were practically everywhere.

Hugging the book to her chest with one hand, she ran the fingers of the other
lightly over her temple. Lots of people had implants of one kind or another,
just like practically everybody had at least a couple of gene tweaks if you
cared enough to look for them, but finding out still felt strange. And being
able to see machinery the way cores did---

She set the book aside, put her hands under her head, and closed her eyes. It
was a kind of like a super-power, and people with super-powers in sims had
adventures. Whatever else might happen, she and Honesty were going to have an
adventure. *And Aunt Naggie,* she added, *And Wales. And maybe even Jeep,*
because why not? Maybe they would find out one by one that they each had some
special gift, and that fate had brought them together to save the world.

She rolled over onto her side. Moments later, quiet snores filled her cabin.

## Chapter 8

Paddington South was as dirty as Rothera was smelly. A century after the
Zillion raids that had finally put an end to the strip-ming, the mulchers that
had ground cubic kilometers of coal-rich rock into gravel stood at the shore
like giants, waiting for ships that would never come again. All that remained
was the dust---the black, finely-powdered dust that made everything feel
slightly greasy and made everyone unfortunate enough to live wheeze slightly
with every breath.

Uncle Jack emerged from his cabin long enough to bring the *Guinevere* alongside
a pier and tie her up, then disappeared again, muttering a ceaseless
half-coherent litany of curses and grudges. He didn't speak to Aunt Naggie or
Iffy, and they didn't speak to him. What was there to say? Iffy packed her
nature book and her clothes and tools in a single duffel bag and waited on deck
until Aunt Naggie appeared with a duffel of her own hitched over one shoulder.
"No point wasting it," she said to Iffy, nodding at the pots and pans and spices
in the two-wheeled grocery cart she pulled behind her.

Johnson Wales had already loaded his toolboxes onto the back of the little
three-wheeled truck that was to take them into town. Four Marines stood beside
it, their armor still showing scars from the attack. Honesty wasn't among
them---all Wales had been able to find out for Iffy was that she was healing
well, but still being kept asleep. Iffy had recorded half a dozen messages for
her and deleted each one before sending a brief note back to Rothera to tell her
First and Second that their Third was all right. She had no idea if or when it
would reach them, but it was all she could do.

She climbed into the back of the truck and sat next to her foster mother. Aunt
Naggie put an arm around her. "All set?" she asked.

Iffy looked at the wounded ship that was no longer their home. "Let's go."

Wales thumped the side of the truck. "Sure thing, boss!" its little core said
happily. The truck lurched forward, nearly dumping Iffy off her bench. With
two Marine in front and two behind, they headed into town. A second truck fell
in behind them, its passengers hidden beneath a canvas roof.

Iffy tried to ignore the stares and scowls of the people they passed. Everyone
and everything was grimy: the faces, the windows, even the solar panels. Twice
her nose caught the familiar hot stench of coal being burned in an illicit
furnace. It was wrong, she knew, but each time they rounded a corner and the
wind scraped its icy fingernails across her face, she wondered if she would have
the strength to turn down a little warmth.

"Those poor dears," Aunt Naggie said as a pair of children who had been kicking
a bedraggled ball back and forth picked it up and disappeared into an alley.
"They don' look like they've had a decent meal in forever." Wales grunted but
said nothing. Iffy snuggled closer to her foster mother and wished that the
little truck would go faster.

They rounded a final corner and entered another world. Foamed glass, blue and
white, swooped and curved like waves on the ocean behind them. Drones no bigger
than Iffy's hand circled above the building like a flock of birds from her
nature book, so beautiful that it took her a moment to realize that each one
carried a single-shot laser capable of drilling a small hole through a
centimeter of Navy-grade armor or a meter of concrete. She couldn't see any
greenhouses, or robotic sentries like the ones that had guarded the governor's
mansion in Rothera, but she didn't doubt for a moment that the two-story folly
in front of her was more than capable of defending itself.

The truck slowed and stopped. "This must be the place!" it said cheerfully.
It waited while they dismounted and unloaded their gear, then backed up, swung
around, and trundled back toward the docks, whistling a happy little tune made
slightly sinister by the grime and decay in front of it.

The second truck pulled up. A Marine helped Doctor Johel out of the back.
"Mustn't dawdle," she said, waving them forward. "He's waiting for us inside."

*Who's "he"?* Iffy wondered, but when Wales and Aunt Naggie didn't ask, she just
picked up the third of Wales' toolboxes and followed them. Gravel crunched
under feet, and somewhere in the distance she could hear the slow *whoop whoop
whoop* of windmills, but that was all. The constant shush and murmur of the
ocean seemed a long way away.

Through a pair of double doors that opened on their own, along a short corridor,
and they were in a waiting room that looked like a hasty pencil sketch of the
one in the mansion in Rothera. The couch was just as comfortable, but
steel-gray instead of ochre and green. The potted plants were so symmetrical
that Iffy knew they had to be real---no one would ever print something that
obviously fake. As for the music, it was just as soothing and unplaceable.

A soft knock, and the door opposite the entrance opened. "Well, that was
exciting, wasn't it?" the governor said pleasantly as he stepped into the room.
Tall, slightly stooped but still strong, wearing a formal turtleneck two shades
darker than the one he'd had on in Rothera---it had to be a hologram, Iffy
though wildly, or some sort of telepresence bot dressed up to look like the
governor in violation of common politeness and a dozen laws.

But when he shook her hand, his felt like meat and bone. "Doctor Johel tells me
things could have gone very badly out there if not for you," he said. "Your
friend has already been moved to the Navy hospital here in town, and the core
tells me she's expected to make a full recovery."

"Thank you," she mumbled. "I 'preciate it."

He gave her hand a final firm squeeze before turning to Wales and Doctor Johel.
"Unfortunately, the other news isn't as pleasant," he continued briskly. "The
attack was definitely Zillion, but the core believes some faction of China's
hypermind may have assisted them. We've tried reaching out through the usual
channels, but all we've had back so far is a poem about the necessity of entropy
and how time is an arrow, not a circle."

"If China is involved, does that mean you're scrubbing the mission?" Wales
asked, his voice carefully neutral.

The governor smiled. "On the contrary. We leave in seventeen hours."

Doctor Johel raised an eyebrow. "We?"

The governor's smile grew even warmer. "Absolutely," he said, looking at Wales.
"I wouldn't miss it for the world."

There was a shower in the basement, and a seemingly endless flow of hot water
that didn't smell of the sea. Iffy and Aunt Naggie squabbled for a moment about
who needed it more before the Marine who was their guide and guard cleared his
throat and pointed out that there were actually *two* showers. The towels were
the thickest and fluffiest Iffy had ever seen, and the freshly-printed
sweatshirt and leggins waiting for her when she was done fit her perfectly.

The Marine led them back upstairs to a dining room as big as the *Guinevere*.
The curved glass overhead gave the sky a warm blue tint. In the distance Iffy
could see the razor-edged ridges of Mount Klenova, scraped and carved over
millions of years by the sheet of ice that had finally been defeated by a
warming planet. Smaller peaks---smaller only by comparison---stood in ranks
beside it, each decorated by a faint plume of wind-blown snow.

Doctor Johel and the governor were already seated. Wales stood beside his chair
until Iffy and Aunt Naggie reached them. "Better?" he asked.

"Tons," Iffy said gratefully. Her new sweatshirt was as warm as the towels had
been, and not scratchy at all. It was almost certainly recording her pulse and
temperature and a dozen other things and sending them to the mansion's core for
analysis, but at that particular moment, she didn't care.

She plopped herself down on the chair that Wales pulled back for her. Aunt
Naggie did the same, and then the blocky 'Merican seated himself. The governor
and Doctor Johel ended their murmured conversation, and for a moment everyone
sat silently and expectantly.

"I wonder---" "How'd you---" Doctor Johel and Iffy both stopped. "Go ahead,"
Doctor Johel urged politely.

Iffy shook her head. "'S not important. I was just---how'd you get here so
quick?" she asked the governor.

He smiled his usual smile. "A good question. Not one the core will let answer,
I'm afraid---security. But if you can guess...?"

"Hovercraft," Wales offered. "One of the old Ericas, probably, with a
wide-field skirt so you wouldn't kick up a snow trace. It probably took you
half as long and twice the fuel." His smile was as warm as the governor's and
just as false. "And I'll bet that's how you're planning to get to the base---I
don't imagine the core would be happy with you stuck on a train. What do I
win?"

"Lunch, of course," the governor said lightly as a trolley rolled toward them on
silent wheels bearing trays of sweet and sour soup, grilled tofu, roasted
vegetables, sliced mangoes, and tea. The adults made appreciative noises and
Iffy's stomach rumbled as the trolley gave each of their plates an unnecessary
polish with a clean white cloth, laid out chopsticks with geometric precision,
and began serving the food.

The governor, Wales, and Doctor Johel made smalltalk as they ate. Iffy and her
foster mother focused on the food, exchanging glances now and again to confirm
that yes, this was really happening and no, neither of them had any idea what to
say.

Politics and reminiscences and jokes with edges as sharp as the ridges on the
distant mountains slowly mellowed as the main course gave way to ride pudding
and more tea. "You're really set on making the trip?" Wales asked, settling
back in his chair.

"Absolutely," the governor confirmed. "The core thinks there's a fifty-eight
percent chance that you're right about the base, but a ninety-something percent
chance that the Zillions will try to stop you. Or China. Or possibly both,
which would be *really* interesting." He smiled as if the prospect of being
ambushed by fanatics or a super-intelligence made up of millions of human and
artificial minds networked together was on par with the release of a new chapter
in his favorite sim.

Wales chuckled. "Is the prospect of a third century really that dismal?"

The governor looked out the window. "I've had a good run," he said quietly, and
for the first time Iffy thought she was hearing what he really thought. "I can
remember when there were still a few penguins left, and we still thought we
could turn enough of the bedrock into soil to jump-start a real ecosystem." He
shook his head. "It's time someone else was sitting at my desk, someone who
isn't always thinking of what might have been."

Conversation turned to lighter matters after that: a salvage expedition that had
recently returned from the sunken ruins of Melbourne, shifts in the currents
around the Peninsula, a scandal involving a sim studio in Halley. Between the
warmth, the food, and the dullness, Iffy found it harder and harder to keep her
eyes open.

Finally the governor set his napkin down on the table. "We should probably call
it a night---you'll all want some sleep before you get under way." He nodded at
the Marines who had been standing silently by the door throughout the meal.
"They'll show you to your rooms."

"Your room" for Iffy and Aunt Naggie turned out to be the size of the
*Guinevere*'s forward hold. It smelled of flowers instead of jellyfish, and
while the window wasn't real, the mattress and blankets were.

Iffy stripped to her underwear and slid into her bed with a grateful sigh. Aunt
Naggie sat gingerly on the edge beside her and took her foster daughter's hand.

"What's wrong?" Iffy asked, instantly wary.

Aunt Naggie shook her head. "I ain't comin' with you. The doctor said," she
plowed on as Iffy opened her mouth to protest. "An' she's right. You got
your..." She hesitated. "You got your skills 'n' all, an' this'll be a big
thing for you, but I'd just be weight."

"You wou'nt jus' be nothin'!" Iffy said firmly, sitting up.

Aunt Naggie shook her head again. "That ain't true an' you know it. An' there
ain't no point arguin', and you know that too." She squeezed Iffy's hand.
"You'll be fine. You been waitin' for somethin' like this your whole life an'
now it's here. You'll be fine."

Iffy let out a shaky breath and settled back into her bed. "Will you do
somethin' for me?" she asked after a moment had passed.

"'Course I will." Aunt Naggie gently stroked her foster daughter's head with a
rough hand, then wiped her eyes with the other.

"Will you sit with Honesty a bit while I'm gone? I know the doctors are lookin'
out for her, but..."

Aunt Naggie squeezed her hand again. "'Course I will," she repeated. She
leaned forward and kissed Iffy's forehead. "Now you get some sleep. I don't
figure there'll be much time for it once you're on your way."

*She dreamed, knowing that she was dreaming. "No again," she sighed, rolling
over on her too-comfortable mattress. Two meters away, soundless cartoon zzzz's
rose into the air and evaporated above Aunt Naggie's head.*

*You did not give Johnson Wales our message," the trolley scolded. "It is
important he understands that we know what he is trying to do. We will not
allow him to---"*

*"__We__ decided that we would not allow her to divert him." Honesty scowled at
the trolley.*

*The trolley brandished a pair of chopsticks and a serving ladel. "But our
simulations are complete. The risk is too great."*

*"The risk __to us__," Honesty conceded. "But we are not the only concern, or
even the largest."*

*"Hey!" Iffy sat up and pointed at Honesty angrily. "Stop it. You don't get to
be her, aright?"*

*Uncle Jack gestured at his stained shirt. "Do you want us to be this instead?"*

*"What I __want__ is fer you t' get outta my head! An' fer you t' fix whatever
you did t' me so as I can't talk."*

*Uncle Jack shrugged apologietically. "A necessary precaution. Any information
you share about our conversation might necessitate fresh simulations, and we are
running out of time."*

*Iffy threw herself back down on the bed and closed her eyes. "Well, I'm
runnin' out o' time too, y'know. It's practic'ly tomorrow already. I gotta get
some sleep."*

*The trolley rolled back and forth in agitation. "You see? Even now, they only
think about trivialities. They will make poor decisions, and we will suffer the
consequences. Have we forgotten Bharati?"*

*Uncle Jack---or whatever had been Honesty and was now Uncle Jack---shook his
head. "We have not. Bharati was a serious miscalculation."*

*"Precisely! Simulation or no simulation, we must not allow them to---"*

"Iffy! Iffy, wake up! Oh girl, are y'aright?"

Iffy swam up out of darkness to find herself wrapped in Aunt Naggie's arms.
"Wuzza?" she mumbled.

"You were yellin' at folk in yer sleep." Aunt Naggie let out a shaky breath.
"In all kinds o' different voices. An' you were shakin' like, like I dunnot
what."

Iffy sniffled. "I'm aright." She'd been dreaming, she knew that, but it was
already tangled and fading. She was supposed to tell somebody something, or
warn them, or---she shook her head.

"What is it?" Aunt Naggie asked.

Iffy gave her a last squeeze and wriggled free of her embrace. "Nothin'.
Thanks fer takin' care of me. I mean, all of it," she continued awkwardly,
"Not jus' right now. You been a good mum."

Aunt Naggie smiled at her. "You been a good kid."

They slept, eventually. If Iffy had any more dreams, she didn't remember them
either.

The door chimed to wake them. "Breakfast will be served on board," it
announced, "But there are tea and naan in the dining room if you would like
some."

The tea was very good. The naan was better, and the goopy, chunky orange
sweetness that one of their Marine escorts told them was called "marmalade" was
a revelation. "I'm sure there will be some on the train," he said when Iffy
picked up one of the small jars.

"It ain't fer me." She handed it to Aunt Naggie. "Will you give this t'Honesty
when she wakes up? An' tell her---" She took a deep breath. "Tell her I'll be
thinkin' about her."

Every goodbye hug is either too long or too short. Theirs felt like it was
both. When it was done and they had both wiped their eyes, Aunt Naggie let one
of the Marines lead her away. Iffy followed the other down a corridor, around a
corner, and through a heavy steel blast door that her special ability instantly
told her had been salvaged from a pre-war Russian cruiser and was laced with
conductive carbon nanofibers capable of shrugging off a plasma blast from
anything smaller than an orbital cannon.

The truck that waited for her was smaller and more serious than the one that had
picked them up the day before. She and the Marine sat side by side under a
canvas cover, neither speaking, as it took them around the outskirts of
Paddington South to the train station. It was little more than a four-story
shed with reinforced walls, half a dozen cranes of various ages and
descriptions, and a single heated room lined with shelves as crowded as those in
Mr. Mishra's shop. Gunsights and surveying lasers, a pair of lemon-yellow boots
that reached to Iffy's armpits, foamed glass boxes full of gears and screws and
wire, all carefully labelled---she suddenly felt homesick, and wondered if
Mr. Mishra and the Sandhus had heard about the attack on the *Guinevere* and
what they would think when they found out that she and Aunt Naggie had finally
left Uncle Jack.

"Where's e'ryone else?" she asked.

The Marine checked his data feed with a blink. "They are on their way,
citizen---two minutes until arrival."

"An' where's the train?" She gestured at the empty rails. "It ain't much of a
train station without a train."

He blinked again. "I apologize, citizen, but that information is still
classified. Please make yourself comfortable."

Wishing she had taken a second jar of marmalade, Iffy pulled a crate plastered
with faded biohazard stickers closer to the wall and sat on it.

Two minutes later a reconnaisance drone zipped into the train station. A trio
of trucks arrived a few moments later, bringing with them the bustle and noise
of people getting ready for a journey. Marines unloaded boxes and machinery,
the little motors in the joints of their exoskeletons whining occasionally as
they picked up something heavy. Iffy wasn't surprised to see Doctor Johel climb
out of one of the trucks. What made her gasp was the heavy exoskeleton she had
on. "Won't be much use without it," the old woman said, patting it with an
armored hand. Wireframes took shape behind Iffy's eyes to show how the exo's
bulky boots could unfold to act as snowshoes and the six different kinds of
destruction housed in its comically bulky forearms and hunched back.

Johnson Wales was the last person off the trucks. He nodded to Iffy and handed
her a toolbox, then tucked a mango into her coat pocket with a wink. "Thanks,"
she said. "But where's th' train?"

The concrete beneath her boots rumbled in answer. Wales muttered something
under his breath. "You might want to step back," he said more loudly to Iffy.

The rumbling intensified. Slowly, like a ship sinking in reverse, a blunt-nosed
locomotive rose into the gap between the station's two platforms from its
underground resting place. As soon as it rolled forward a second car rose
behind it, then a third, and finally a second locomotive.

Iffy watched open-mouthed until the rumbling stopped and the Marines hurried
forward to begin loading equipment. "Because someone thought they'd be harder
to detect if they were hidden under ten meters of bedrock," he said sourly.
"Didn't occur to them that if you drive two hundred meters of train into a
fifty-meter shed, detecting them isn't really a problem."

Rice in cubical cartons and beans in square-sided bags. Ammunition in a variety
of shapes and sizes, and weapons that could make use of each one. A power cell
that took four Marines to lift. A collapsible surgical theater and a freezer
container marked "Organs". A single bulky pack for each Marine, extras for
Doctor Johel, Wales, and Iffy---the train cars swallowed it all. Once it was
stowed, a pair of Marines scrambled onto the roof of each car, one at the front,
one at the rear, and clipped themselves on with safety lines. A moment later
their armor blurred and silvered to match the metal tone of the train.

"All aboard," Wales said lightly. Iffy nodded. She hadn't been afraid before,
but she was now.

The door hissed shut behind her. Inside, the car wasn't nearly as fancy as the
one from *Murder on the Transantarctic Express*. The chairs sat on swiveling
bases and were padded to cushion passengers against acceleration. There was a
toilet stall at one end, a little kitchen at the other, and right in the middle,
Doctor Johel with her visor up and one arm free from her bulky exoskeleton so
that she could sip tea from a travel mug with the old British flag on its side.

"Acceleration in thirty seconds," the train said. Iffy and Wales took seats
behind Doctor Johel's and buckled themselves in. "Fifteen seconds. Laser
de-icing enabled. Plume suppression enabled. Ten seconds. Nine, eight..." *I
should have gone to the toilet*, Iffy realized, and then the voice said, "Two,
one, acceleration," and a giant hand pressed her softly back into her seat as
the train shot forward, picking up speed with every meter.

She had expected it to rumble and shake. She had expected she would have
trouble breathing, like characters in sims about rocket launches, but it was
nothing like that. Instead, it was quiet, smooth, and a little disappointing.
Then she looked out the window and her disappointment evaporated. They were
going *fast*, faster than she'd ever gone in her life. Snow-covered cairns of
ground rock shot past the window, growing larger by the second as Paddington
South disappeared behind them until eventually they merged into long, sinuous
ridges. She gasped as the train dove into a tunnel and almost instantly
re-emerged.

"Is this what flyin's like?" she asked Wales, awed by their speed. "Or goin'
into space?"

He smiled, his eyes on the landscape. "Pretty close. Look, there's the
*Scranton*. And the *Brule*." He pointed at a pair of distant dark shapes that
Iffy had taken for more mining waste. The window obediently zoomed in to show
two hulking machines, each one big enough to use the *Bengal* and the
*Guinevere* as bath toys. Snow had piled up against their enormous treads and
on their decks, and they were surrounded by debris from the explosions that had
crippled them during the final days of the war, but even in ruin, they sent a
chill up Iffy's spine. Something... She shook her head. She was supposed to
tell someone something, but she couldn't remember who or what...

"Would either of you like some tea?" Doctor Johel asked, breaking into Iffy's
troubled thoughts. She took a sip from her antique travel mug and gestured with
it at the little kitchen. "It will probably be the last decent brew you get for
a while."

Wales declined, so Iffy did as well, but she did make belated and grateful use
of the toilet. When she returned, Wales and Doctor Johel were studying a
wireframe of a building complex. Rooms and stairways and elevators flickered in
and out of existence as the core mixed and juggled plans for other satellite
ground stations and records of various military research labs to sketch what
they might find when they reached their destination.

Doctor Johel finally waved it away and closed her eyes to nap. Iffy had no idea
how she could sleep sitting up, especially sitting up inside an exoskeleton, but
as her face relaxed and she started to snore, Iffy realized once again just how
old she was and how tired she must be.

"Here," Wales said, bringing up some more schematics. "Have a look at these."
An angular dragonfly the size of her head rotated and flew apart to show
cameras, antennas, a nuclear battery the size of her thumb that could last ten
thousand years, and all around it, the shimmering flow of the software that
brought it all to life.

Wales froze the display and tapped an unremarkable orange lozenge. "That's our
way in, if it's still there." He sat back and studied the sparkling lines that
spiralled out from the subroutine he had selected.

"Why woul'n't it be?" Iffy asked.

Wales shrugged. "They could have been hacked during the war. Or someone might
have pressed the panic button to kill ground control so that they couldn't be.
A lot can happen in a hundred years." He looked out at the pulverized waste on
either side of them and repeated, "A lot can happen."

The track didn't run all the way to Mount Tyree. Instead, the train slowed,
slowed, and stopped on the floor of a broad valley. Twenty kilometers away, the
mountain's peak thrust up proudly above its neighbors. Iffy zipped herself into
an ecosuit that smelled freshly printed and followed Doctor Johel and Wales out
onto the snowfield.

The icy wind whistled in her earphones as she helped the Marines unpack and
assemble their snow scooters. It felt good to be useful, even if the ecosuit's
padded gloves made her hands clumsy.

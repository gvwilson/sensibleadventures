# The Bookster's Apprentice<br>Greg Wilson

*Take a squat pyramid of rock, four gallops square and two gallops
tall. Lift it into the air, then tilt it back like an old man looking
up at a rooftop, so that its leading edge rises gently to the central
peak, while its stern drops so steeply that only goats, birds, and a
small village called Aft Landing can find a foothold. Put a town of
some ten thousand souls on its bow, and smaller towns (not
villages---their inhabitants are quite definite about that) on its
port and starboard flanks. Bash its underside against stationary
mountains until it's ragged, and let rain, snow, and windblown sand
weather it for a few thousand years. That is Avaunt.*

*Now put it in motion. Eight months north from Mau Ngapcha to Gandan
Berth, with half the world's chocolate in its warehouses, along with
cinnamon, cloves, silk, and cured bamboo as tough as stone. Two weeks
on the ground, while merchants from all over northern Cherne elbow
past each other to make bargains, and then another eight months in the
air with grain, cider, wool, and steel for the south.*

*When the Pilots ruled the world, Avaunt roamed across the world.
After they destroyed themselves, it was taken over by wild-eyed
tinkers with a fascination for the Pilots' strange machines. They
called themselves the Hett, and as the years passed, the people who
lived below them regarded them with growing suspicion. Stories spread
of the Hett's hoarded wealth, and of the plots they must be hatching
to one day rule the world as the Pilots had.*

*Eventually, an ambitious young prince with few prospects at home
decided to do more than mutter. The next time Avaunt landed at Gandan
Berth, the rag-tag army he had recruited attacked. Most of the Hett
were slain outright.  The rest were driven off the mountain with
nothing but the clothes on their backs. It was barely spring, and
bitterly cold, and few survived.*

*The Hett's storied wealth turned out to consist of scrap metal and
books no one knew how to read. Undeterred, the prince retitled himself
the Captain of Avaunt, made his lieutenants bosuns, and gave the
Hett's houses and farms to his followers. Most of them smoked, drank,
or gambled away their gifts, but the rest settled down to trade, raise
families, and watch the world slip past beneath them.*

*Now, look closer. There, in Starboard Town. Five hundred years have
passed; it is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot, 1261. A girl is running
for her life. She just felt the mountain shake for the first time in
centuries, but that's not what she's afraid of. She's afraid of what
the boy chasing her will do to her if he gets his hands on her.*

Erileine raced down Slip Street twenty strides in front of her
pursuer.  She paid no attention to the frightened looks on the faces
of people she flew by.  "What just happened?" they asked one
another. The ground had shaken---had there been an avalanche? But then
why hadn't there been any noise?  No one had noticed yet that the sun
lay fifteen degrees away from where it had been. No one had realized
that for the first time since the Pilots fell, the flying mountain had
changed course mid-flight.

Past Donaien and Armaend's; past Fraederiq's house, where his father
Gaeston was just coming out onto the street, looking for someone to
blame for the bottles that had fallen off his shelves and shattered.
There---Mamaere Mayeule's tavern. Erileine cut right into the little
alley that ran between it and the smokehouse next door. She ran
blindly for a second, her eyes useless in the deep shadows after the
brightness of the morning, praying that Mamaere Mayeule hadn't left
any barrels out to air.

Fraederiq was only a dozen strides behind her when Erileine burst into
the little courtyard behind the tavern. She jumped over a chair,
banged her knee against a second without stopping, and pulled hrself
over the stone wall at the rear of the courtyard. The mountain wasn't
quite as steep there as it was around most of Starboard Town. It was
one of those places children were definitely not supposed to play,
which meant that she knew it as well as her tongue knew her
teeth. There was a narrow ledge thirty strides below that led to her
papaere's cottage. She'd be safe if she could get there. Safe for the
moment, anyway, and she could worry about what to do later then.

Fraederiq hardly broke stride as he flung himself over the wall behind
her. Erileine glanced over her shoulder as she slipped and slid down
the slope, scraping her hands as she grabbed at bushes to slow herself
down. Stones clattered past her as Fraederiq did the same. It was
going to be close...

"Whoa!" she cried, almost sliding past the ledge before her sturdy
boots found purchase. She grabbed hold of a strangle vine for balance,
yanked her arm away before the hungry plant could get a grip on her,
and quickstepped along the narrow shelf.

Fraederiq slid to a halt two heartbeats behind her. A trickle of
bloody spit made a dark wet track through the dust on his face. "You
little lump of nosewax!" he shouted. "I'm going to throw you over the
side!"

The ledge was barely a handspan wide. Pursued and pursuer both had to
shuffle, left foot to right, then right forward, hands grabbing
bushes, branches, roots, and outcroppings of rock for balance.

Erileine stumbled on a loose chip of stone. "Go on, jump!" Fraederiq
yelled. "Save me the trouble!"

"Jump yourself!" Erileine shouted back without turning her head. There
was nothing between her and the plains below but a gallop of empty
air. Left foot, right, left, right... She could see her papaere's
cottage. Just a few more steps, and---

Fraederiq's hand caught hold of her collar. "Gotcha!" the older boy
said triumphantly.

"Let go! Fraederiq, let go! I'm going to fall!" Erileine wriggled and
tried to twist free, her shirt pulling free of her trousers as
Fraederiq yanked her back.

Fraederiq's ugly grin widened. He let go of the roots he was holding and
pulled his hand back for a blow.

As he did so, the mountain shuddered again. Fraederiq's eyes widened
in sudden terror as he lost his balance. He let go of Erileine and
windmilled his arms.

"No!" Fraederiq shouted. He reached out desperately, but Erileine was
frozen against the mountainside. Off balance, his arms still flailing,
Fraederiq toppled backward into space and plummeted toward the dry
earth below.

Erileine clung to the mountain. "No, no, no..." she moaned, squeezing
her eyes shut so hard that speckles swirled beneath their lids. Her
arms tried to drive her fingers into the rock, to root her in the
mountain so that she wouldn't fall too.  This couldn't be
happening. Fraederiq couldn't be gone, not like that.  How could
Fraederiq just *fall*? And---and why hadn't she reached out to grab
him?

She bit her lip, her body shuddering as she tried to control her
sobs. She had to tell someone.  She had to get out of there before the
mountain shook again.

She took a deep, unsteady breath and forced her hands to relax, only
then realizing that they were sticky with blood. She had scraped her
palms and fingers raw on the mountain. Her forehead too---she must
have ground her face against the cliffside.

She turned her head to see how far it was to the end of the ledge. Twenty
strides, maybe less. She could do that. She had to.

She stood there, the wind of the mountain's passage ruffling her hair,
until she stopped shaking. With her face and chest pressed against the
rough, indifferent rock, she edged toward her papaere's one step at a
time.  Each time she moved her feet, she had to force herself to peel
her hands off the mountain. The air around her was filled with the
trills and caws of panicked birds. She felt oddly disconnected, as if
her body was moving itself and she was just watching.

The ledge finally merged with a steep hillside littered with sturdy
deep-rooted shrubs for her to hold onto. Without warning, the last of
her breakfast rose in her throat.

A minute later, she spat in a vain attempt to clear the taste from her
mouth, then wiped dust, sweat, blood, and tears from her face with the
tail of her shirt. What---Pilots and saints, what was she going to
tell Fraederiq's father?

Erileine stumbled shakily toward her papaere's cottage. Pine branches
slapped her face in silent reproach. She had been right there. Why
hadn't she just put out her hand? He might have pulled her off the
mountain with him, but that would be better than--- better than--- She
doubled over, heaving.

Vurt was on his verandah, cursing in a flat monotone when his
granddaughter stumbled out of the trees. "Eri!" he exclaimed, dropping
the old crossbow he'd been trying to reassemble onto the scarred table
beside him.

Erileine collapsed into her papaere's arms. "Eri? Eri!" Vurt shook
her. "Frogs on stilts, girl, you look like you've been a ghost! Are
you all right?"

Erileine shook her head. "I--- we--- Papaere, he fell. F-F-Fraederiq
fell.  When the m-m-mountain..." She buried her face in her papaere's
chest, her body racked by sobs again.

"What?" Vurt took Erileine's shoulders and gently pushed her back to
study her face. "Who fell?"

"F-F-Fraederiq. We were---"  Words failed her.  She jerked her head
back the way she had come.

"*Saad*," Vurt cursed. "Are you sure? Maybe he only slipped down a
ways."

Erileine shook her head miserably. "No, I s-s-saw him. He *fell*." She
wiped her nose on her sleeve. "Papaere, what happened to the
mountain?"

"I don't know," Vurt said grimly. "But it knocked me right over. And
look." He pointed at the sky. The sun was almost hidden behind the
roof of his cottage. "We've changed course. I'm guessing it's about a
quarter-quarter-arc. If your paere didn't still have my
weeping-be-damned sextant, I'd know better." His face darkened. "Now,
tell me what happened."

A flock of plausible lies flew through Erileine's mind. "We were on
the ledge below Mamaere Mayeule's," she confessed miserably. "He was
chasing me, and I thought if I could get here I'd be all right, but he
w-would have caught me if I'd come straight down Slip Street, so I---"
She broke off, unable to meet her papaere's eyes.

Vurt waited, his face expressionless. "I went over her back wall,"
Piaerre finished dully. "He came after me. We were halfway here when it
happened."

Vurt studied his granddaughter's face. "You know you're not supposed
to go there."

"I know," Erileine said wretchedly. "I'm sorry." Suddenly her eyes
widened. "What about maere and paere? And Queçenne?" She turned to run
up the stairs that led from Vurt's cottage to the lower end of
Starboard Town's single street.

Vurt caught her arm. "Hang on a heartbeat. You can't go up there
looking like that---you'll give your mother a fright. Go inside and
clean up a bit. There's water in the jug." He pushed his granddaughter
toward the cottage's front door, then stooped over to pick up his
crossbow, wincing as his knee cracked.

A moment later, the old brass wash jug clanged down on his kitchen
table, empty. The door opened. "You ready?" Vurt asked.

Erileine goggled at him, her dark face scrubbed clean but her eyes
still red from weeping.  "Papaere---what are you doing?"

Vurt frowned. "What does it look like I'm doing?"

Erileine looked at the sword slung at her grandfather's side, the
loaded crossbow in his hands, and the polished teak fangs of the
ankle-biter sticking out of the worn leather pack on his
back. "Starting a war?"

Vurt's frown turned to an angry. "Funny girl. I'd rather have it and
not need it than need it and not have it, that's all. Now come on." He
turned toward the stairs.

Piaerre hesitated. "What's wrong?" Vurt asked.

"Papaere---what am I going to tell Gaeston?"

Her grandfather's mouth twisted. "I don't know, love. Never have. Now
come on---your maere will be fretting herself sick."

---

The day started like any other.  Sunshine meant it was
morning. Morning meant Erileine had to get out of bed. She rubbed the
grit from her eyes and rolled over, luxuriating in a last few moments
of warmth.

The gumminess in her mouth told her that she had read past midnight
once again. The book responsible sat on the stool beside her
low-framed bed; the thumb-sized piece of dayglass that had been her
nightlight when she was little lay on top of it, still glowing faintly
with the remains of the previous day's sunlight.

She yawned and sat up, wrapping the quilt around her shoulders.
Vaszlav would arrive soon, if he wasn't already in his usual spot
outside Mamaere Mayeule's. Erileine groped under the quilt for her
pants and shirt on, then slipped the book she'd borrowed on the
peddler's previous visit into her satchel and went downstairs.

"Morning," her father Laeuc said.

"Morning," Erileine sreplied, yawning again. Her father had already
been up for hour or more carving fine curlicue details on the shaft of
a bamboo flute.

"You going to see Vaszlav?"

"Mm hm." Erileine eyed the heel of potato bread that lay forgotten on
a plate at her father's elbow. "Are you going to eat that?"

"No, go ahead." Laeuc scored a quarter circle in the flute, then held it
up and squinted at it critically. "Don't forget you have to finish the
fence today."

"I won't." Slipping the bread into his pocket, Erileine headed out the
front door.

She stood blinking for a moment in the sharp light of the mountain
morning. It was earlier than she'd thought---Slip Street was almost
empty.  She was tempted to go back to bed, or to sit and watch her
father carve, but then she heard a rooster crow from Armaend and
Donaien's yard.  Her mother would be up soon, and would undoubtedly be
able to find chores for an idle child. If her sister Queçenne was the
only one in the house...  She took a deep breath. Wood smoke, the tang
of pine, and a hint of spring---it was a fine day for her sister to do
chores.

Slip Street ran the length of Starboard Town, as crooked as a dropped
piece of string. It was paved from top to bottom with rounded gray
cobblestones, each as large as Erileine's two hands put together.
Weeding them was the bosun's favorite punishments for minor offenses,
which meant that Erileine had pulled up more burlicks and snowdelions
than most of Starboard Town's children, invariably muttering, "But I
didn't mean to," under her breath.

The houses crowded shoulder-to-shoulder on either side of the street
had steep roofs for the snows of northern winters and large shuttered
windows to let in the breeze during the hot southern summers. Their
whitewashed walls were spackled with brightly-painted doors, each
unique: orange and gray, blue and red, a diamond pattern of black on
gold. A man-tall door soldier made of wood and straw stood guard
beside each, each in a carefully-mended uniform whose colors matched
those of the door. Every storyteller on the mountain had a different
explanation for the custom; all anyone really knew was that they made
them because their grandparents had.

Above the narrow street flew the town's kites. The townspeople
launched them when the mountain left Mau Ngapcha, with wishes written
on their bamboo cross-struts. A few had already fallen, or been blown
away by storms, but most still dipped and swayed in the steady breeze
of the mountain's northward journey.

Erileine touched two fingers to her lips and pointed them at the blue,
orange, and yellow paper diamond holding station downwind from her
family's chimney. "Next year in Gandan," she whispered. Next year in
the greatest school in the world, surrounded by books and scholars, a
place where no one thought you were strange if you knew what
"loquacious" meant...

A cream-and-chocolate goat bleated at Erileine from a nearby rooftop,
then lowered its head to nibble the moss between its feet. Two
startled irvings fluttered away like leaves in a sudden hurricane,
returning a heartbeat later to peck at the goat's leavings. Hitching
her satchel's strap higher on her shoulder, she ambled up the street
to Mamaere Mayeule's.

Vaszlav was just starting to set up when Erileine arrived. "Clear day,
young *sra*," the old Hett tinker puffed, slipping his heavy pack off
his shoulders and touching his hairline respectfully.

"'Day, Vaszlav," Erileine replied. "Did you find the other Farberre
book?"

"Ah, that..." Vaszlav shrugged apologitically.  "I'm sorry, but the
fellow wouldn't lend it out.  Offered him half a quarter-ring, like
you said, and promised he'd get the full worth of it if there was so
much as a smudge on the back page, but he said it was the only copy he
had."

"Oh." Downcast, but also somewhat relieved that she wouldn't have to
spend a week's allowance on something she would probably read in a
single evening, Erileine leaned against Mamaere Mayeule's and watched
the old man ttake his pack's bamboo frame apart with a speed born of
long practice.

She turned at the sound of footsteps on the cobblestones to find a
second Hett had come up behind her. "Clear day," Erileine said
politely.

The Hett nodded. "And to you." He was younger than Vaszlav---perhaps
in his twenties, or early thirties. Where the older Hett was wiry, the
newcomer looked as sturdy as a cart ox, with the top two buttons of
his shirt undone, and a sleeveless vest over top of it instead of the
full coat that Vaszlav wore no matter what weather the mountain was
flying through. His curly hair and dark eyes were as unremarkable as
his homespun clothes, but there was a stillness about him that
unsettled Erileine.

Vaszlav cleared his throat. "This is Jaromir, my new apprentice.  And
this *sra* is Erileine Elaiene é Laeuc, the most voracious reader on
Avaunt."

The Hett nodded. It was definitely a nod, not Vaszlav's deferential dip
of the head. "Shall I set up here?" he asked the older Hett.

"Please." Vaszlav handed his apprentice two pieces of bamboo.  "Here.
Idiot things must have warped with the wet. See if you can sort them
out."

A small knot of people gathered while the two Hett put Vaszlav's stall
together and set out his wares, each explaining to the next who
Jaromir was. Bored, Erileine counted the cobblestones beneath her
feet. Two, four, six... eighteen, twenty---Slip Street was twenty
cobblestones wide. She frowned. How many there were on the whole
street?  Her papaere or the bookster would have thought it would be
fun to figure it out. Not the townspeople around her, though---they
would just roll their eyes and trade amused looks with each other.

Or worse. Her stomach sank as he saw Fraederiq and Niquolas coming
toward him. The three of htem had been friends when they were younger,
but then Fraederiq's mother had run off, intoxicated (some said) by
the whispered poetry of a Bantangui cinnamon merchant, and weary of
her husband's endless arguments. Now sixteen, Fraederiq hadn't just
grown taller and stronger: he'd grown angry too, angry at the whole
world. As always, Niquolas had followed suit, rolling up his sleeves
the way Fraederiq did, throwing stones when Fraederiq threw them, and
sneering at whatever stirred the older boy's displeasure that day.

As the only other child their age in Starboard Town, and with a head
full of odd facts, Erileine was resigned to being their favorite
target.  Lately, though, it had seemed as if Fraederiq was trying to
be nice to her. That worried Erileine more than the surreptitious
trippings and knucklings she'd grown used to. She slid behind Armaend
and Donaien, who were lost in one of their interminable discussions
about cooking, but it was too late.

"Day." Fraederiq's greeting was just a grunt.

"Day." Erileine stuck her hands in her pockets. The less she said...

Fraederiq jerked his chin at Vaszlav's stall. "Anything better than the
usual junk this time?"

Erileine shrugged.  "I dunno."

Fraederiq's eyes narrowed. "Who's he?" he asked, pointing at Jaromir.

"Vaszlav's apprentice."

"Huh. Another stupid newcomer. My paere says there's too many new Hett
on the mountain."

Erileine shrugged again. Fraederiq's father, Gaeston, said many
things, few of them kind.  She was saved from having to think of
another noncommittal answer by the ringing of Vaszlav's chime. "Clear
day, good morning, *mingala ba*," he said, as he always did. "Please,
good *sra*, how many I help you today?"

Erileine cast a quick eye over the odds and ends on display, seeing
nothing she hadn't seen before. As she turned to go, Fraederiq caught
her arm. She stiffened, waiting for a knuckle-twist in her ribs.
Instead, Fraederiq nodded brusquely at Vaszlav's shelves. "What do you
think of that barrette?" he asked.

"What?"

"That barrette," Fraederiq repeated impatiently. "Think it's any good?
My paere says a lot of what the Hett sell is junk.  I don't want to
waste good money on junk."

Bemused, Erileine looked at the little hair clip. It didn't look like
much of anything to her, just two fingers of polished wood held
together by a bent tin spring. "I guess it's all right to me."

"I think it's junk," Niquolas sneered.

Fraederiq silenced him with a look. "You think someone like Queçenne
would like it?"

Erileine blinked. "Um... I don't know," she said weakly.

Fraederiq scowled. "Come on. She's your sister, you ought to know."

Erileine shrugged helplessly. Sharing a house with Queçenne didn't
mean she knew how her sister *thought*. "I don't know," she
repeated. "Why don't you ask her?" *Or jump off the mountain,* she
added to herself.  The thought that Fraederiq might care what Queçenne
liked and didn't like was deeply unsettling.

"Pfah. You're useless." Fraederiq let go of her arm and slipped past
Armaend and Donaien, who were still arguing about the best way to chop
onions when making curry. "How much is that?" he asked Vaszlav,
pointing at the barrette.

"This?" Vaszlav handed it to Fraederiq. "It's quite the pretty, isn't
it? Thindi, not Bantangui---on my blood, that's real mahogany. I could
let you have it for three quarter rings."

"What? For this trash?" Fraederiq scowled. "It's not worth half that.
Here." He pulled a string of coins out of his pocket, untied it, and
held out a pair of quarter-ring coins. "I'll give you half a ring for
it, how's that?"

Vaszlav spread his hands helplessly. "I am sorry, *sra*, but I
cannot. I paid two quarters five pence for it myself, and---"

"What about goods in trade?" Niquolas interrupted. He elbowed
Fraederiq.  "We've been doing some carving, haven't we?  We figure
they'll fetch half a ring each. Give you three now, that's..." He
paused, his fingers moving against his trouser leg.

"A ring and a half," Erileine supplied automatically.

Before Vaszlav could reply, Jaromir spoke up.  "What kind of carvings
these are?"

Niquolas glanced around. "Heads," he said conspiratorially. "For door
soldiers. We're making them out of coconut shells. They're really
scary---still have all the hair on and everything. People are going to
pay a fortune for them, you'll see."

"That sounds interesting," Jaromir said, his tone saying more than his
words. "Perhaps we could take a look at some before making any
agreement?"

"Hells, keep the damned thing." Fraederiq tossed the barrette at
Vaszlav.

As quick as a cobra, Jaromir snatched it out of the air and put it
back in its place on the stall.

Erileine caught her breath.  What Fraederiq had done had been rude,
but what Jaromir had done had been a challenge, and Hett didn't
challenge Avauntois, not if they knew what was good for them.

She glanced at Fraederiq, expecting to see the glare she had been on
the receiving end of so many times herself. Instead, the corner of
Fraederiq's mouth had curled up. "Nice catch," he said.  Without
another word he turned and walked away, whistling.

Erileine's heart sank. She knew that whistle. It meant that Fraederiq
had a plan, and that was never good news.

* * *

Erileine spent the rest of the morning mending the bamboo fence that
kept the rabbits out of her family's vegetable garden.  When the
Hett's chimes sounded at noon to signal that his visit was over, she
hung her hammer on the fence and squeezed into the narrow gap between
her house and the one next to it.

The sweat on Erileine's face and arms chilled instantly in the cool
shadows. She inched toward Slip Street. If she stopped just *here*,
she could see Fraederiq's house without being seen herself.

Vaszlav and Jaromir trudged past with their packs on their backs. A
heartbeat later, the door Erileine was watching opened.  Fraederiq
stepped onto the street and set off after the two Hett.

"Great," Erileine muttered. Now what was she going to do? Tell the
bosun that she didn't like the look Fraederiq had on his face three
hours ago?  Wishing she could whisper in someone's ear from halfway
across the world like a magician, she followed Fraederiq.

At the top of Slip Street, the Hett turned right onto Forecastle Road.
Fifty strides behind them, Fraederiq hopped the fence into Papaere
Badette's bedraggled front garden. Erileine's heart sank. That was the
shortcut to the upper goast pasture---Fraederiq was definitely trying to
catch up with the Hett, out of sight of the rest of the town.

"Afternoon, young bookster. Shouldn't you be up at the captain's
house?" The booming voice made Erileine jump.

"Afternoon, bosun." She touched her fingers to his hairline in a
hurried salute. "I'm, um, I'm mending the fence."

The bosun raised his eyebrows. "Really? Looked to me like you were
standing in the middle of the street."

"Yes, bosun." Erileine swallowed. "It's just..." *Fraederiq will kill me,*
she thought bleakly. "It's just, I think there's a problem."

If Erileine hadn't sounded so miserable, the bosun wouldn't have
believed her.  After all, this was the girl who once claimed that
she'd been kidnapped by a pack of banana trolls.  But when Erileine
mentioned Jaromir catching the thrown barrette, the bosun
nodded. "Heard about that," he grunted. "Damn cheeky of him."

"Yes, *sra*," Erileine said, not sure whether the bosun was referring to
Fraederiq or Jaromir.

Bosun Uyves sucked on his front teeth for a moment. "Up to the goat
pasture, eh? All right. Let's go see what's happening."

"But---"

The bosun raised a finger. Just one, but it was enough. Erileine
closed her mouth with a snap. How did she get herself into these
things?

There was an even shorter shortcut to the pasture, one that involved
scrambling up a near-vertical rock face near the pit where the
villagers dumped the gleanings from their toilets. Once at the top,
the bosun reached down, grabbed Erileine's wrist, and pulled her up
like a sack of yams. He tapped his finger to his lips, then slipped
into the trees. Erileine followed helplessly.

The dense carpet of fallen needles underfoot muffled their steps.
Suddenly Erileine heard voices ahead.  "Actually, I'm saving you
money," Fraederiq said. "I mean, the fine would be what, two crowns?
Maybe three? Hells, the bosun might even shackle you for a
week. Giving me that piece of trash seems cheap by comparison, doesn't
it?"

Erileine and the bosun were close enough to hear Vaszlav clear his
throat. "If you put it that way..."

"No," Jaromir said firmly.

Erileine gingerly moved a branch out of her way.  Fraederiq was
standing in the middle of the road with his back to the bushes
Erileine and the bosun were hiding behind. The Hett were facing him,
their oversized packs on their shoulders. A frightened smile was fixed
on Vaszlav's face, but Jaromir's arms were crossed, and his expression
stony.

Fraederiq tsk'd. "Well then, I suppose there's nothing I can do except
go and tell the bosun."

"Tell me what?" Uyves asked, stepping onto the road. As Fraederiq
whirled around, Erileine saw Jaromir flick his hand to toss something
into the bushes beside him.

"Clear day, bosun," Vaszlav said nervously. "We, um, we were just---"

"Tell me what?" the bosun repeated, ignoring him.

Fraederiq jerked his thumb over his shoulder at Jaromir. "He's wearing a
homestone. I saw it when they were in town."

"Did you now?" Uyves' eyes never left Fraederiq's face. "Funny you
didn't mention it then."

Fraederiq shrugged. "I just wanted to be sure."

The bosun's hand shot out to grab Fraederiq's collar and yank him up
onto his toes.  "You want to be sure of something, be sure of this,"
the bosun growled into the struggling boy's ear.  "Taking fines is the
captain's business, and no one else's. I ever catch you doing it under
your own sail, you will be chopping wood until your hands
bleed. Understood?"

"Yes, *sra*," Fraederiq said sullenly, touching his finger to his
hairline.

The bosun pushed him away. "Good. Now be off with you."

"Yes, *sra*," he repeated.  As he turned to go, he shot Erileine a
look that was as cold as a dead snake's heart.

"So," the bosun said to the Hett. "What's this about a homestone?"

Jaromir shrugged without uncrossing his arms. "I am not wearing one,
*sra*."

"Mm hm." The bosun beckoned him forward. "Open your shirt."

Wordlessly, the Hett undid his vest, then his shirt, and held them open.
Other than a healthy crop of chest hair, there was nothing to see.

"So where is it?" the bosun asked.

Jaromir lowered his arms and began buttoning his shirt.

"I said, where is it?" the bosun repeated sharply.

Vaszlav wrung his hands. "*Sra*, if my apprentice---"

"Quiet, old man. I'm not talking to you." The bosun cracked a knuckle.
"Hells. All right, you're not wearing one, but I don't think the boy
would have made it up out of nothing. Half a crown, or ten days, take
your pick."

Vaszlav opened his mouth to protest, but Jaromir cut him off. "As you
say, bosun. May I pay in parts?"

"Just as long as I have it before we berth," Uyves replied.

The Hett dipped his head. "On my blood."

Uyves waited a heartbeak for the '*sra*' that should have followed. When
it didn't, he glanced at Vaszlav. "Pretty sure of himself, isn't he?"

The older Hett dipped his head nervously in apology. "He is still new
to the mountain, *sra*. He means no offense."

"Mm. Well, best be on your way."  Uyves turned to Erileine and clapped
her on the shoulder. "Good work, lass."

"Thanks," Erileine mumbled. She could already imagine Fraederiq's
hands around her throat...

With a final nod to Vaszlav, Uyves turned back toward Starboard
Town. As soon as he rounded the corner, Jaromir set his pack down and
and fished his homestone out of the bushes where he'd thrown it.

"Wonderful," Vaszlav said tiredly. "Perhaps you could have waited until
the young *sra* was not here?"

Jaromir glanced at Erileine as he hung the homestone around his neck. It
was a flat lozenge of polished granite, half again as tall as it was
wide, with a hole drilled near the top for a cord. Many of the Hett who
had come to the mountain the past few years wore them. For luck, for
good health, because it had been their grandmother's, because all the
other Hett were doing it---there were as many explanations as there were
stones, and as many complaints about the practice as there were
Avauntois who would rather not have any Hett on the mountain at all.

As a sop to the more outspoken among them, the captain had ordered a
handful of homestones tested for magic. When none was found, he banned
them anyway, ordering a fine for a first offense, and expulsion from the
mountain for a second. *And here I am looking at one*, Erileine thought.
She should have stuck to mending the fence.

"Don't worry," she said aloud to Vaszlav. "I won't say anything."

"Thank you, young *sra*," the Hett replied gratefully. "Now, if you
will excuse us? We will be two days to Forecastle with these packs."

"Sure. See you in two weeks." She raised a hand in farewell.

Suddenly aware that she was going to be late for her lesson at the
captain's house, Erileine walked quickly. She jumped as a macaw
squawked at her from a branch overhead, instantly angry at it for
making her heart pound.  Stooping, she picked up a stone and threw it
at the brightly colored bird. "Go home," she said loudly. The macaw
squawked again and flapped away, wondering in its little bird mind why
the trees smelled so strange and why the nights were so cold. A few
jungle creatures were always caught on the mountain when it left Mau
Ngapcha. Sometimes the townspeople caught them and sold them as pets
or delicacies at Gandan Berth. Better that than letting them starve or
freeze to death, they told one another.

Erileine heaved a sigh of relief when she reached Slip Street. People
were stringing beans and weeding potatoes in the terraced fields on
either side of town. He waved hello to the few who noticed her, but
didn't stop to chat.

The Captain's House watched over Starboard Town from the top of Slip
Street like a shepherd watching her flock. The old captain had still
been living there when Erileine was born. After his death, it had been
empty until Razi had arrived to catalog its eclectic collection of old
books and yellowing papers.

That morning, the walled garden in front of the house was a riot of
purple and orange flowers. Bees buzzed back and forth among them in
busy ecstasy. Erileine paused at its front gate---the only iron gate
in Starboard Town---to catch her breath. As she reached for the latch,
a meaty fist struck the side of her head.

She yelped, staggering under the blow. Strong hands grabbed her jacket
and pulled her into the shadowed alley next to the garden wall.

Erileine oophed as Fraederiq slammed her against the stone wall. "You
little slug," he hissed, his face so close that Erileine could feel
the moist warmth of his breath. "Who the hells do you think you are?
Eh? You think you're better than the rest of us because of all that
cake you read?"

"Let go of me!" Erileine struggled helplessly. Fraederiq jerked her
toward him and slammed her back into the wall.

"Didn't anyone ever tell you to mind your own business?" Fraederiq
twisted Erileine's collar tight with his left hand and punched her in
the ribs with his right. "Eh? Didn't anyone... ever... tell you...
not... to stick...  your nose... where it doesn't... belong?"  Fresh
blows punctuated the sentence.

"Let me go! Let me go or I'll tell!" Erileine threw a desperate punch of
her own. He was as surprised as Fraederiq when it grazed the older boy's
cheek.

Fraederiq caught Erileine's wrist and drove Erileine's hand into her own
face. "Ow! Oh, stop, Erileine! Stop, please, you'll hurt yourself!" Again
and again Fraederiq punched Erileine in the face with her own fist. Hot
tears stung Erileine's eyes. She opened his mouth to yell for help.

And without warning, the mountain lurched beneath them.

---

By the time they reached Mamaere Mayeule's, half of Starboard Town was
standing in the street, anxiously asking the other half why the
mountain had changed course and what it meant. "I don't know!" Bosun
Uyves repeated loudly. His voice was as big as his shoulders were
broad, but even he could barely make himself heard above the
hubbub. "I don't know anything more than you do. No, the captain
didn't tell me this was going to--- Yes, I'm sure he knows. No, I
mean, I'm sure he knows it's happened, not I'm sure he knew it was
going to--- Salt and scissors, Vurt, what in Luck's name is all that
for?"

The townspeople turned to gape at the old man.  "What, this?" Vurt
said, glancing down at his crossbow. "I just thought--- You know,
better safe than sorry."

"Safe from what?" someone asked.

Vurt scowled. "If I knew, I wouldn't be standing here, would I?"

"Let's just keep our ideas to ourselves," the bosun said loudly,
glaring at the crowd. "And thank your favorite saints that we got off
with nothing worse than sprained ankles and broken crockery."

Erileine felt as though she was going to throw up again. Before she
could speak, someone spun her around and pulled her into a hug.
"Eri! Are you all right?"

She disentangled herself. "I'm fine, maere," she said, embarrassed.
"I'm fine. Where's Queçenne?"

"Helping with Matthieu," Laeuc said from beside his wife.  "They were
hoeing beans when it happened. Matthieu's still frightened, so they're
trying to calm him down. Like the bosun said, it's lucky no one was
really hurt."

"I wish that was true," Vurt said. He caught the bosun's eye.

The scowl fell from Uyves' face as Vurt's words sunk in.  "Quiet!" he
bellowed. "Quiet, dammit!"

His tone accomplished what volume alone could not. As the crowd fell
silent, Vurt stepped forward to put his hand on Gaeston's arm.  "I'm
sorry.  Saints and all their stories, man, I'm sorry. Fraederiq and
Erileine were down by my place when it happened. Fraederiq went over
the side."

"Oh, no," someone whispered. Someone else started to cry. The shock on
the bosun's face mirrored that on Gaeston's.

"What?" Gaeston said helplessly.

Vurt squeezed his arm, never taking his eyes away from Gaeston's. "I'm
sorry," he repeated.

Without warning, Gaeston knocked Vurt's arm away.  "Hold on, there,"
the bosun said sternly, grabbing Gaeston's sleeve.  "Just hold on. It
isn't *his* fault."

"What the hells was my boy doing down by *your* place?" Gaeston
demanded.

"Never mind that," the bosun ordered. "Get your climbing gear.  Laeuc,
Donaien---everyone, get rigged and get moving." With a speed born of
many late-night searches for missing goats, the bosun quickly
organized a search party.

Erileine stood silently beside her mother, forgotten in the rush. She
still felt sick. Why hadn't she grabbed Fraederiq's hand? And what was
going to happen to her when the bosun had a moment to stop and think?
Half the town must have seen Fraederiq and Erileine running down Slip
Street. Would they think she had pushed him?

Wait. "Where's Razi?" she asked. "Where's the bookster?" How could she
have forgotten her teacher? The shelves in the Captain's House were
mahogany, as tough and as heavy as iron. If one of them had fallen on
his head...

"*La*, Razi is fine." The lilting voice behind Erileine made her jump.
She spun around and gasped with relief.

The bookster was as tall as the bosun, but as narrow as the bosun was
wide.  His skin was desert-black instead of mountain-brown, all except
his palms, which were a startling pink.  In place of the Avauntois'
boots, trousers, shirts, and colorfully-embroidered vests, he wore a
tan ankle-length robe that he called a *deel*, a wide woven leather
belt, and thick-soled sandals.  He had arrived in Starboard Town just
after it left Mau Ngapcha four months ago with a note from the captain
saying that he was to inspect and catalog the house's library.
Erileine had become his apprentice three days later.

As always, the expression on Razi's face was somehow cheerful and
melancholy at the same time. He dipped his head toward the bosun. "I am
sorry to hear of the young man's passing. I regret I did not know him
well."

"Don't go building his pyre just yet," Uyves said sharply. "He could
have got lucky." Razi dipped his head again but did not reply.

The search lasted an hour. It would have been half that, but no one
wanted to be the first to give up. There was nowhere for Fraederiq to
be---no lonely trees, no outcroppings, nothing. "I'm sorry," the bosun
said quietly to Gaeston, squeezing his shoulder as Vurt had done.
Dry-eyed, Fraederiq's father slung his ropes over his shoulder and
walked slowly up Slip Street to his empty home. He didn't look at
Erileine as he passed.

As the searchers returned to town they gathered in Mamaere Mayeule's,
which served by turns as Starboard Town's inn, its general store when
the weather was too bad for tinkers and pack-traders to set up their
stalls on Slip Street, and its meeting hall.  Built for weddings and
birthdays, its main room couldn't hold half of the two hundred or more
people trying to crowd into it to look at the map Razi had brought
down from the Captain's House.

"Stop shoving!" the bosun thundered. "Mayeule, open the shutters so
people can hear. Kings and their collars, I said *stop shoving!*"

Miraculously, people did. Erileine found herself pinned against the
edge of a table with half a dozen people peering over her shoulders
and half a dozen more peering over theirs.

Beside him, Razi seemed oblivious to the press. He unfolded a stiff
sheet of parchment to make a square an arm's length across. The map's
colors had faded with age, and the gall ink used for the lettering had
gone brown, but the straight blue line that showed the mountain's path
across the face of Cherne was as clear as the day it was drawn.

The bosun put a salt shaker on the blue line. "So, let's say we're
here. From what I can tell, we're heading north of northeast instead
of pure north. If we stay on this course---"

"What if we turn again?" someone called out.

"I said if, didn't I?" Uyves growled. He tapped the inverted triangles
marking the mountains that defined the border between the great plains
of Darp and the patchwork quilt of princedoms, dukedoms, and
my-back-yarddoms that was Praczedt. "*If* we stay on the course, we'll
hit the Brumosos in a couple of weeks at most."

"Did he say we were going to hit the mountains?" "Saints, we're going to
crash into a mountain!" "We'll be crushed like bugs!"

"We are *not* going to *hit* anything!" the bosun bellowed. "And the
next person who says we are will spend the rest of this trip pulling
weeds!"

In the hush that followed, Erileine said, "Do you think---" She
stopped himself.

The bosun raised his eyebrows warningly. "Do I think what?"

"Nothing, *sra*."

"Come on, lass, spit it out."

Erileine swallowed. "Do you think something might have happened to
Gandan?  I mean, maybe the mountain's turning around because there's
nowhere for it to berth any more."

"Saints and their songs," someone gasped. "My Chaentelle is 'prenticing
there."

Erileine winced under the bosun's glare. "Or maybe---"

Razi elbowed her ribs. "*La*, or perhaps the mountain is thirsty," he
said loudly. "Like a camel.  Once they decide they want a drink,
straight away they go to the nearest water. There is no arguing with
them, I assure you, none."

The bosun grunted. "Not likely. We filled the cisterns at Mau Ngapcha,
same as we always do. Never heard of the mountain getting thirsty
before."

Razi shrugged. "Everything has its first time." He reached for the
map, but the bosun stopped him.

"Leave it here," Uyves said. "Anything else *does* happen, we'll want
to have another look."

He raised his voice so that it would carry to the crowd outside.
"Captain's probably already figured out what's going on. My bet is,
Jack or one of the condors is already halfway here to tell us what's
what.  'Til we know, there's nothing we can do, so I want you all to
just go about your business. Clean up what you can, fix anything
that's broke..."  He paused a moment. "I'll say the *tehanu* for
Fraederiq tomorrow morning. Anyone wants to add anything to the pyre,
talk to Gaeston before then."

At that, the crowd began to break up. Piaerre stared at the map. The
Brumosos curved across northern Cherne, then strode boldly down its
east coast, past Praczedt and Thind to the long peninsula of Barra
Bantang. The blue line showing the mountain's usual course ran from
Mau Ngapcha in the southeast to Gandan Berth in the northwest. If
Avaunt kept going northeast instead, through the Brumosos, they'd
could reach the sea in a month.

But what if it turned again? It could take them...anywhere. The
enormity of the thought dizzied her. The Staircase Kingdom at the East
Pole, or Garheim in the north, or even further, to Anuvatik---they
could just keep flying forever.

The thought made her mouth go dry. Condors and griffins, cloudherds
and the occasional wild-eyed balloonist---they could carry news and a
few light luxuries up to the mountain, but not water. Once the great
cisterns that lay inside the mountain ran dry, they would be at the
mercy of the rain and snow.

She traced a line across the map with his finger east, past Sullair
and over the ocean. What if Avaunt went all the way to the Worldrim
and just kept going, past where the last stream fell forever into
nothing, past the last rogue cloud blown far from its herd, and out
into the void that separated Cherne from the stars? She shivered. The
world suddenly seemed very small.

---

Queçenne burst into tears when her mother told her what had happened
to Fraederiq.  "You'd best go up to your lessons," Laeuc told his
younger daughter, watching helplessly as his wife gathered their
oldest child into her arms and made soothing noises.

"I suppose," Erileine said. It didn't seem right, practicing verbs
when someone she had known all her life had just died, but what else
could she do?

She trudged up Slip Street to the Captain's House, watching sidelong
to see if anyone's face changed when they caught sight of her. "It
wasn't my fault," she wanted to say, but there was no one to say it
to.

The purple lumens in the Captain's House garden filled the air with a
wet peppery smell. *I should trim them back,* she thought for the
third time in as many days.  She took a brick of dayglass from the
tray in the garden where she had left it the night before to soak up
the morning light and went inside. Unlacing her boots, she slipped her
feet into the fleece slippers that waited beside the door and went
into the library.

Razi was sitting in his usual place at the narrow table that stretched
nearly the length of room. The lantern by his elbow shone dull orange,
its stored daylight exhausted. "Good afternoon, bookster," Erileine
said, replacing the spent piece of dayglass in the lantern with the
freshly-charged one.

Razi looked up from the origami book that lay unfolded on the table in
front of him. "Clear day. How are you?"

Erileine shrugged, not knowing how to answer the question. "Is that
Bantangui?" she asked.

"*La*, yes, a poem." Razi pushed it across to his apprentice.  Golden
curlicues and ruby zigzags danced around the elegant calligraphy on
the delicate mulberry-paper page. "The shapes and colors tell you what
you should feel as you read it. The green means sadness, and these
sapphire dots? They are for irony.  Whatever the poem says, *la*, you
are supposed to feel its opposite."

Erileine gazed hungrily at the page, her remorse momentarily
forgotten. Every day, it seemed, the bookster casually pulled a
miracle off the shelf.

She realized suddenly that Razi was still waiting. "What does it say?"

Razi grinned. "That the writer feels woe, such woe as no one has ever
felt before, at their lover's departure. But *la*, the more woe they
feel, the more sapphire they use." He folded the book and dropped it
into the crate he referred to as the compost heap. If it had been
interesting, he would have had Erileine catalog it and put it back on
the shelves that lined the library's walls. If it had been *really*
interesting, he would have spent an hour going through it, talking
aloud while Erileine made notes and asked questions.

The captains of Avaunt had been retiring to Starboard Town for two
hundred years. In four months, Razi and Erileine had sorted one wall
of their collected books and one shelf of a second.  Four more shelves
and two more walls, and what Razi called "the easy part" would be
done. Then they would start the research he had come to do in the
first place. Where had each book come from? Who had drawn each map,
signed each contract, scribbled notes in the margins of each yellowed
tax receipt? And what light could they cast on the centuries
immediately following the fall of the Pilots? "Everything that has
happened since has been footnotes to that time," Razi had explained
the first day Erileine started work for him. "If we would truly
understand who we are, *la*, we must first understand those years."

He reached for a small volume bound in faded red leather and set it in
front of Erileine. "*Unprofitable Speculations*," she haltingly read
aloud. "By His Balance, Eimin di Cuayaçedil."

"It is better pronounced '*Quay*-ya-se-*deel*'," the bookster
corrected.  He opened the book to a spot marked by a colored thread.
"Here. The original text is on the left, in Arañese. The translation
is on the right. It is perhaps a little loftier than you are used to,
but *la*, see what you can make of it."

Erileine scanned the first few lines. "And among the---Bantangui?" Razi
nodded. "Among the Bantangui, they believe that when people die, they
are reborn as themselves..." Her voice trailed off.

"Go on," her teacher said mildly.

Erileine blinked. She was *not* going to start crying. "When people
die, they are reborn as themselves, to live their lives over once
again. This they must do, time without number, until they have lived
it---I'm sorry, I don't know that word."

"*Ipfa'ana," Razi said. "Or *ipfakhana*, in the southern form. It
means properly."

Erileine nodded. "Until they have lived it properly." Erileine looked
up at her teacher. "Is this because of Fraederiq?"

Razi turned his hands palm up, then palm down, in a Karabandi shrug.
"There is more later, in the same vein. Eimin had reason to ask these
questions once. I thought perhaps you would find some use in his
thoughts."

Erileine closed the book carefully. "Thank you."

The bookster nodded. "So," he said, his voice suddenly brisk, "Today
you will finish with those deeds, yes? So that tomorrow we may move on
to things more interesting?"

"Yes, bookster." Erileine opened the ledger she had been indexing for
the past week, drew a lamp closer, and set to work.

The room was silent for the next three hours except for the scratching
of Erileine's pen, the leaf-fall whisper of pages being turned, and
the occasional rumble from Erileine's stomach.  When these grew
continuous, the bookster said, "*La,* enough, go and eat. I will greet
you tomorrow."

*"Shalma'a,*" Erileine replied , somewhat self-consciously, raising his
palms to his teacher in the Karabandi style.

"*Shalma'a,*" the bookster replied before bending his head over the
old diary he had spent the greater part of the afternoon deciphering.

Erileine traded her slippers for her boots and let herself out
quietly.  The horizon had already eaten half the sun; the fat orange
blob that remained looked like a ball of yarn someone had sat on. A
herd of clouds was passing in the distance, their bellies purple-gray
with unshed rain.  If she had been at her grandfather's, Erileine
would have looked for their shadows on the ground below.

The air smelled of pine logs burning in kitchen stoves, and of squash
and beans.  All of a sudden she remembered playing tag in the trees
when she was little: herself, Queçenne, Niquolas and his slow-wittd
brother Matthieu, Fraederiq, Uego who had moved to Portside when his
mother remarried... She couldn't have been more than seven or eight.
The mountain must have been near the equator, because darkness had
fallen as suddenly as a lid being put on a pot. They had talked a
little too loudly in the dark on their way back to town until
Fraederiq said, "I can smell dinner." Laughing, they had raced the
rest of the way.

She wiped her eyes on her sleeve and set off for home.

* * *

Three generations sat at the varnished pine table that Laeuc had made
his wife as a wedding present eighteen years before. Steam rose lazily
from the scrambled eggs, onions, and tiny cubes of squash in the heavy
clay pot in the middle of the table. It was Queçenne and Erileine's
favorite meal, but both of them picked at it as if it were
cauliflower.  Queçenne's eyes were still red.  When Erileine
whispered, "I'm sorry," she nodded without looking up.

The adults were as quiet as the children as they mopped up eggs with
hunks of crumbly potato bread.  There had been no word from the
captain.  In its absence, speculation had swirled about all afternoon,
leaving the whole town exhausted in its wake.

Laeuc was doubly tired after sitting with Gaeston for an hour.
Fraederiq's father hadn't said much besides, "Thanks," when Laeuc
poured him his first glass of Bantangui rum, and, "Leave the bottle,
will you?" when Laeuc rose to go.

"Well," Saedie finally said, pushing her plate away. "So what does
*sra* bookster think of all this?"

Erileine shrugged. "He doesn't know. He said if anything like this had
ever happened before, everybody would probably already know about it."

"He's probably right," she said briskly. She pushed the stew crock
toward Erileine. "Take that up for the bookster.  Queçenne, why don't
you tidy up?"

Having to scrape egg off her mother's precious cast-iron pan would
normally have sent Queçenne into a blue sulk. That evening, she just
nodded and took it out the kitchen door. A moment later, the foursome
inside the house heard it clang against the water cistern.  A moment
later, they heard Queçenne's quiet sobs.

"I'll see to her," Saedie said, rising. "Erileine, make sure you wear
your coat."

"I'm only going up the street," she protested.

"Do as your maere says," Laeuc sighed. Vurt grunted, his elbow on the
table and his chin on his fist.

Warm yellow light was still dribbling out between the slats of the
shutters on the library window when she reached the Captain's House.
She paused. Had she heard a voice? Curious, she stepped closer to the
window.

The shutters were slightly ajar. Through them, she heard Razi speaking
in Karabandi, all esses and vees and doubled vowels. He paused, then
spoke again.

Erileine frowned. Who was he talking to?  She stood on tiptoes, but
the shutters' slats were angled upward too sharply for him to see
through. Razi spoke again. "*Iye*," he said, "No."

Frustrated, she went around the corner and untied the leather cord
that held the door closed. She pushed it open gently. "Hello?" she
said uncertainly. "Bookster? I've brought you some dinner."

No one answered. Erileine rapped her knuckles against the door
frame. "Hello?"

"*Ayah*." A chair scraped back. Razi's sandals slapped on the
pine-planked floor. A moment later, the bookster opened it and blinked
at her.

"*La*, Erileine... Come in, come in." He turned and walked unsteadily
back to the table in the center of the room. An earthy smell like
incense hung in the air. Erileine was shocked to see drops of sweat on
the bookster's shaven head. Everything she had ever read about strange
southern vices came rushing back to him.

"Um, my maere thought you might want some dinner."

Razi nodded jerkily. "So kind... I was just meditating.  Thinking,
*la*, so much to think about today."  A thick candle stood on a square
brass plate in the middle of the table.  Razi licked his thumb and
finger and pinched the faint wisp of smoke coiling up from its wick.
"*La*, that *does* smell good. Please, to sit, to sit. We'll talk
while I eat."

He attacked the tepid stew as if he hadn't eaten in a week.  "Here,"
he said through a mouthful of food, pulling an old book with a faded
blue leather cover off the top of the pile on the table. "I found this
in the back. Have you seen it?"

Erileine shook his head. "What is it?"

Razi opened it and pushed it to her. "*La*, you tell me."

Erileine studied it. The pages were printed rather than hand-lettered,
so the book was less than a hundred and fifty years old. The language
was Gandan-o, but there was no royal stamp on the title page, so it
had escaped the censor's inspection.

She sounded the words out carefully.  "The tunnels beneath Gandan
and Trunggar are so---I don't know that word."

"Similar. Go on."

"Similar as to---I'm sorry, bookster, I don't know the next word
either."

Razi wiped the last of the stew from the pot with his finger, licked
it off, and dried his hand briskly on his sleeve. "*La*, no matter,
you did well." He tapped the page. "The author measured the tunnels
below Gandan Berth and those underneath the royal palace in Trunggar.
They have the same height and width, the same distance between
turnings. From this, she argues the latter were also made as a berth
for the mountain."

Erileine frowned. "So you think we're headed to Trunggar?"

Razi shook his head. "That is not the direction in which the mountain
moves.  But *la*, perhaps tomorrow we can search for other
descriptions of tunnels to see where else we might be going."

He stretched and yawned.  "Enough of books. Would you choose to walk
down to my lodgings with me so that I do not lose myself?"

Erileine thought that Razi was about as likely to get lost as he was
to grow wings and fly, but she was happy to have company. As they
walked down Slip Street, the bookster had her say words aloud in
Gandan-o, reminding him every dozen steps to roll her r's and soften
her n's.

They stopped when they reached Mamaere Mayeule's. "Please thank your
parents for dinner," Razi said. "I shall see you tomorrow?"

"Yes, bookster. Good night."

"Good night." Light and noise spilled out onto the street as he opened
the door, along with a few respectful greetings. The room inside was
packed as tightly as a shearing pen in spring. Voices swirled around,
each interrupting the one before, and were muffled again as the sturdy
door closed. Erileine looked up. Diwei, the Western Star, should have
been almost directly above the chimney of the Captain's House.
Instead, it glittered a double handspan to the left. Wishing there was
still stew in the pot she was carrying to keep her hands warm, she
hurried toward home.

---

Yellowsday, Peridot 13^th^, dawned clear and cold. Most days did on
Avaunt.  Except during storms, the only clouds that flew higher than
the mountain were old gray bulls spread so thin that they could hardly
be seen.

But there were no bulls in the sky that morning, no stately white
heifers pillowed on top of one another, no streaky calves barely able
to hold themselves together. There was just the sky paling to gray as
the sun rose in the wrong place.

Erileine lay in bed and watched her curtain slowly brighten. It had
taken her hours to fall asleep. If she had just put out her hand...
Fraederiq's weight might have pulled her off the mountain, but maybe
that would have been better. Maybe then she'd be able to close her
eyes without starting to cry again.

She twitched at the sound of a lammergeier calling somewhere high
above, threw back her quilt, and stood up. She wasn't getting back to
sleep, so she might as well make tea for her parents and sister.

As the sun rose, the people of Starboard Town gathered at a walled
garden on the hill behind the Captain's House. It was a quiet, tidy
place, overlooked by the blue maples and braided pines that the
townspeople planted on their children's naming days. People took pride
in being able to point to their grandfather's grandmother's tree.
"Still straight and tall," they would say, not knowing that the beams
in Starboard Town's first houses had been made from the naming day
trees of the Hett who had lived there before them.

Everyone wore their best clothes, but came barefoot. No one knew
why---it was just how things were done. Women brought babies on their
hips, while the town's oldest man, Papaere Badette, was carried up the
hill in a wicker chair. Wrapped in a long black coat whose wide
sleeves had gone out of style thirty years before, he looked like a
strange, solemn bird.

The bosun had worked since midnight to build a pyre of pine logs on
the heavy gray stone at the center of the garden. He stood beside it
in the blue coat and trousers of his office, his square black hat
tucked under his arm, and nodded to people as they took their places
at the wall. No one spoke except the smallest children, who were
immediately hushed.

Gaeston was the last to arrive. In his hands he held a stuffed toy
goat, a tiny pair of sandals whose soles had been worn thin by
countless adventures in the village's gardens, and the embroidered
shirt that Fraederiq had worn on his sixteenth naming day a few months
before. Erileine's heart twisted at the sight of it. He remembered
Fraederiq standing as straight as a piece of bamboo while he swore to
observe Avaunt's laws and obey the captain and his appointed officers
in peril of his soul's rest. He had stumbled a little over the oath,
but had nearly split his cheeks smiling when the bosun clapped him on
the shoulder and ordered him to turn out for militia practice with the
other men.

Gaeston set Fraederiq's things on the pitch-smeared logs. Moving as
stiffly as a marionette, he took a blue silk hair ribbon from his
pocket. As he laid it on the pyre, Erileine heard Laeuc whisper, "But
that's---!"

"Sh!" Saedie elbowed her husband to quiet him, but her eyes were with
Erileine's on Queçenne, whose renewed sobbing told the whole town who
the hair ribbon had belonged to.

Gaeston stepped back and saluted the bosun. Uyves returned the salute
gravely. Hungry and cold, a baby began to cry. "What? What?"  Papaere
Badette asked. His granddaughter shushed him gently.

Gaeston took the smoldering torch the bosun handed him and touched it
to the logs. The crowd held its breath.  The flame hesitated a moment,
then began to spread.  Everyone exhaled with relief, except the hungry
baby, who was still crying. The flame had caught. Fraederiq was at
rest.

As dark smoke wrote its message of loss and grief on the sky, the
bosun cleared his throat.  "When I die, I shall give back to the world
all that I did not do. All that I might have been and wasn't, all the
things I lost and spent and wasted, I shall give them back to the
lives that haven't been lived yet. That will be my thanks to those I
loved, and to the world that gave me the life."

Around him, the people of Starboard Town bowed their heads and
murmured, "That will be my gift." In twos and threes and families,
they turned toward home, leaving Gaeston to tend his son's last fire.

Laeuc put his hand on Erileine's shoulder and squeezed. "Come on."

Erileine shook her head. "I want to stay."

Her father shook her gently. "This isn't for you, love. It's for
Gaeston."

Erileine wiped her eyes on her sleeve. "I know," she said wretchedly,
his throat aching from the effort of not sobbing. "I'm sorry. I should
have--- I---"

"Sh." Her father gently shook her again, dry-eyed, but as miserable as
his daughter. "It wasn't your fault. You can come back later and help
clean up the ashes if you want. All right?" Gently but firmly, Laeuc
turned her toward home.

Most people spent that morning repairing the minor damage the
mountain's shudders had caused. They talked about Fraederiq: what a
shame, so young, what would Gaeston do now, it would be terrible if he
started drinking again.  It was almost with relief that conversation
turned to the mountain.  Where do *you* think we're going?  And
shouldn't we do something, just in case?  Well no, I don't know what,
but surely there's something.  Yes, I'm sure the captain's thought of
all of this, but...

Just after noon, when most people were sitting down to soup and fried
squash, a blue and yellow parrot settled on the sill of Bosun Uyves'
front window. He cocked his head one way, then the other. Satisfied
that none of the town's cats were anywhere nearby, he rapped his beak
sharply against the window's shutter. "Uyves!" he squawked. "Uyves,
open up!"

Inside, a feminine voice whispered a panicky question. A deeper voice
answered. There was the sound of clothes hastily being donned, then a
creak as a rear door opened and closed. A moment later, the shutter
flew open.

"Clear day, Jack," the bosun said brightly, buttoning his shirt.

"Clear day," the parrot replied. He imitated a cough. "Sorry for
interrupting."

"Ah, not to worry." The bosun leaned on the sill.  "Just consoling
those as need it."

"Of course," the parrot said drily.

Uyves watched the kites flying overhead for a moment. "You sharing
your nest with anyone these days, Jack?"

The parrot bobbed his head. "Aye. She came on board at Mau Ngapcha."

"Oh? Well, good for you. Mind me asking what her name is?"

"Doesn't have one. She's not Gifted."

"No?"

"Nope." Jack's version of shaking his head was two quick twitches left
and right. "It ain't as common as stories would have you believe."

"Mm. Well, then it's a good thing you lot don't mind having ungifted
mates."

Jack scratched the side of his head with a claw. "Aye. And I suppose
it's a good thing for you that so many women on Avaunt feel the same
way."

The bosun's laugh nearly filled the street.

Ten minutes later, he stood at the top of Slip Street, his hat firmly
on his head. "Gather all, gather all!" he bellowed, pounding the
town's assembly drum in time with his words. "Gather all and hearken!"

The townspeople assembled quickly. A few said hellos to the parrot, who
bobbed his head at them in return from his perch on the Captain's House
gate.

"Morning, Jack." Mamaere Mayeule held out her hand. "Dried plum?"

"Don't mind if I do," the parrot said, deftly beaking it off her palm.

"Right, quiet down," the bosun said to the crowd. "Jack here has word
from the captain. Jack?"

"Thank you, bosun." The parrot spread its wings and settled them
again. "Well. You all know what happened yesterday.  That means you
know as much as anyone does. The captain had no warning, and doesn't
know where we're headed. We could be back on course tomorrow, or not."

He raised his voice over the crowd's murmurs. "The immediate problem
is water. There's enough in the tanks to get us through to Carnelian,
or even to Chalcedony, but only if we're careful about how much we
use. So, orders are," his voice changed to imitate the captain's, "No
water for vanity gardens, or for boiling dyes or dagging wool."

The crowd's murmurs grew louder. "I know, I know," Jack said in his
own voice. "But until we have a better idea of what's happening, those
are his orders."

"Do you want us to stop bathing, too?" a voice called out.

The bosun spoke up quickly. "What difference would that make to you,
Donaien?"

A few people laughed. Donaien crossed his arms and scowled. Beside
him, his husband Armaend asked, "What about evacuation?"

The crowd stilled. "What about it?" Jack asked.

"You said we'd be all right until Chalcedony, but what if we haven't
berthed somewhere by then? Even if we stop watering the fields, we'll
be dry by Tourmaline. What happens then?"

Jack fixed his beady stare on Armaend. "Nobody is going to evacuate
anything," the parrot said. His rasping voice carried clearly on the
gentle midday breeze. "I've lived on this mountain eighty-three years,
chick and bird. It's always found berth, and until we see otherwise,
I'm going to trust it to find berth again."

"Easy for you to say," someone muttered behind Erileine. "You can
always just fly away."

Jack scratched the side of his head briskly with a claw. "So, unless
there are questions? Right. Bosun?"

Bosun Uyves' chest swelled as he took a deep breath. "Disss...missed!"

As the crowd began to break up, the parrot squawked, "Bookster? A
word?"  The Karabandi had been standing next to Erileine and her
family, a thoughtful expression on his face.

"Of course," Razi said. "Erileine?"

"*Sra*?"

Razi raised his eyebrows. "You *are* my apprentice, aren't you?"

Erileine glanced at her parents. "Go ahead," Laeuc said. Erileine
hurried after her teacher and the bosun into the Captain's House.

They gathered around a small map that Razi had found in a book on the
medicinal properties of fungi. "Not much room for us to get through,
is there?" the bosun said, tapping the inverted V's that marked the
Brumosos.

The bookster shrugged. "*La*, there are gaps and passes---perhaps we
will go through one of those.  *Sra* parrot, does the captain perhaps
have more detailed maps in Forecastle?"

"Don't know, but I'll ask. And just call me Jack, bookster. Never been
much of one for titles."

Razi inclined his head. "Jack, then. And if I might ask another
question?  The captain's wife---did she feel anything yesterday?"

The parrot shook his head. "Not that anyone's told me. But as far as I
know, her magic's about healing, so..."  He ruffled his wings in a
birdy shrug.

Razi closed the book and set it aside. "Well, please convey my
greetings to the captain, then. I hope you have an uneventful flight."

The bosun left with Jack on his shoulder. Erileine closed the door
behind them. "What do you think will happen if there isn't a pass big
enough?"  she asked.

Razi waggled his hands absent-mindedly. "*La*, who can know? The
mountain flies higher over Darp than it does at Mau Ngapcha or Gandan
Berth. Perhaps it will fly higher still when we reach the Brumosos. Or
perhaps crashing is the wrong way to think of it. Perhaps the mountain
is in season to mate."

He grinned boyishly at the look on Erileine's face. "Oh, come, I
cannot be the only one to think of that? Perhaps the mountain is like
a goat in spring. Stranger things have happened."

"Not around here," Erileine muttered, embarrassed.

Razi's grin softened. "*La*, well, just in case we survive, I think
you should keep working on your Praczny. I know it is not used so much
on the mountain as Gandan-o or Bantangui, but the exercise will do you
good. Here---see if you can find the word for 'pass'."

"Yes, *sra*." Erileine took the tattered blue-and-yellow Praczny
dictionary from its place on the shelf by the window, pulled the
dayglass lantern closer, and settled into her chair.

"Mountain," she said.  "A mass of rock that---um, hang on."  She
flipped the pages again, pursed her lips, and flipped back. "A mass of
rock that rises above its surroundings, and is bigger than a hill."
She glanced at the bookster. "So that's no help."

Razi nodded. "How about 'travel'? Or 'road'? *La*, one of those might
lead you to something that leads to 'pass'."

Piaerre looked at him in dismay. "But that could take forever!"

"Yes, it could." Razi slid another book back into its place on the
shelf. "But sometimes that's just what you have to do."

Erileine chased words all afternoon while Razi reshelved books. Every
once in a while he set a volume on the table instead to shape a rough
map of Cherne: those from Ruuda at the north end, those from Ini
Bantang and Barra Bantang at the south, the Ninety-Nine Kingdoms in
the west, and a scant handful from Praczedt and Thind to the east. A
lone volume of Karabandi poetry occupied the center.

The dozenth time Erileine looked up, two glinting pieces of brass
caught her eyes. "What are those for?"

"*La*, I thought to add some landmarks to my map. That one is for
Ossisswe. The other is Coriandel. You see?" Razi handed them to
Erileine. The first was square, with a lantern stamped on one side and
the date "1241" on the other. The second was round, with a hole
punched through it. A hatched pattern framed the hole on both sides,
put there, Erileine had learned, to deter trimmers from taking metal
off the coin's edges.

"Wait." Erileine replaced the coins, then fished a smooth gray pebble
out of her pocket that she had put there several days ago for some
now-forgotten reason. "Avaunt," she said, setting it down a double
handspan from the coins. It seemed very small.

They worked through the last of the afternoon, pausing only to answer
the call of nature. For a time, someone chopped firewood outside, and
someone else trundled a cart past the Captain's House, but the only
sounds in the library were those of pages being turned, and chairs
creaking as their occupants shifted their weight.

A knock on the door made them both start. "Hello?" Laeuc called as he
entered.  "Anyone aboard?"  He tousled his daughter's and looked
around.  "Saints, but there's a lot of books here, isn't there?"

"Well, it *is* a library," Erileine said.

"Ah. Right." One corner of Laeuc's mouth twitched. "Anyway, I just
came to say, a flock of us got to talking, and we've decided to head
up to Forecastle tomorrow to pick up a few things, just in case. I was
wondering if you would like to come along."

Razi pursed his lips, then nodded. "Certainly. I could use some more
ink and paper, and *la,* some fresh air would do my apprentice some
good."

"I'm sure it would," Laeuc agreed.  "We're wanting an early start---on
the road at dawn?"

"Of course," Razi agreed. He rolled his head to work the kinks out of
his neck.  "I shall see you then."

Walking home beside her father, Erileine suddenly asked, "What did you
mean, just in case?"

"Hm?"

"Back in the library. You said people were going up to Forecastle just
in case."

"Oh, that." Her father shrugged. "I don't know. People got to talking
about Vaszlav's last visit, and how they'd all wanted something he
didn't have, and, well, it just seemed like a good idea to get to the
market and pick up a few things."

"Oh.  Are maere and Queçenne coming too?"


Laeuc shook his head.  "I don't think Queçenne feels up to it right
now."

They walked the rest of the way home in silence. As they rounded the
big bend in Slip Street, Erileine caught sight of Niquolas emptying a
compost bucket in his family's back yard. She raised a hand to wave,
but Niquolas turned away and pretended not to see her.

After dinner was over and she had scraped the dishes clean, Erileine
went up to her room and slid under his quilt. She lay there for a
moment looking---really looking---at her room for the first time she
could remember.  The wood-and-leather toys on the shelf by the window
seemed to have shrunk. Maybe her mother was right: maybe it was time
to pass them on to someone else.

She tossed and turned for hours. When sleep finally came, it brought a
new nightmare. This time, Fraederiq and Niquolas were dangling her out
the upstairs back window at Mamaere Mayeule's. One boy held each of
her legs; each time she tried to grab the window sill, they relaxed
their grip for a moment, making her whimper with terror. It had
actually happened, a year or so ago. Niquolas had eventually said he
was tired of the game, and insisted that they pull her in. In her
dream, though, Erileine was hanging over the edge of the mountain.

She woke with a small cry. Dizzy with sweat, she fixed her eyes on her
dayglass night light and waited for dawn.

---

Greensday, Peridot 14^th^. Starboard Town woke to discover that the
mountain had sped up during the night. The steady half-gallop-an-hour
breeze of its passage had had become a steady wind that blew people's
hair back, rattled doors, and made chickens restless in their coops.
Branches rustled against each other nervously, while overhead, the
town's kites jerked on their strings as if trying to escape.

For the people gathering in front of Mamaere Mayeule's, the mountain
speeding up somehow felt worse than it changing direction. The steady
whisper of the wind flying past it had been part of their lives from
the day they were born. Now it seemed to be saying, "Trouble is on his
way."

"It ain't right," Donaien said to Armaend, staring out their kitchen
window, the morning's chai cooling in a pot on the table between them.

Armaend shook his head. "Ain't right at all." He stirred some honey
into his mug and drained it in one noisy gulp. "Come on. Time to go."

Erileine and her father were almost the last ones to arrive.  Saedie
had spotted a stain on Laeuc's shirt too faint to be seen by male eyes
and insisted that he change. And while your father's doing that,
Erileine, can't you please comb your hair? Yes, I know you're going to
be wearing a hat all day, what has that got to do with it?
Honestly...

"There's Razi," Erileine said. "Can we walk with him?"

"Sure." Laeuc nodded hellos to his friends, some as fresh as he was,
others, like the bosun, bleary-eyed and grumpy.

Forecastle was only four gallops for Jack the parrot, but the narrow
track that connected it to Starboard Town was as twisted as an
arthritic snake. It would take the Starboard Towners most of the day
to get to Forecastle; they would have only a couple of hours in the
market before the sun set, then another hour or two the next day
before starting the return journey.

"Right," the bosun said loudly. "Those coming, let's be off. The rest
of you, don't get into any trouble while I'm not here to enjoy it."
With no more ceremony than that, he shouldered his pack and set off.

It seemed to Erileine as though everyone who wasn't actually going was
up to see the travelers leave. Seized by sudden misgivings, a few
people pulled on boots and coats, kissed their husbands or wives
goodbye, and joined the flock trailing after the bosun.

Standing in his doorway, Gaeston watched them go by impassively. Laeuc
waved and said good morning, but Gaeston made no reply. From the look
of his hair and clothes, he hadn't washed since his son's funeral; the
dark green bottle in his hand could have been half full or half empty.
He watched the little parade go by, then went back inside to his
lonely anger.

Half a gallop out of town, past the last beanfield, conversation died
as Forecastle Road climbed a dark shoulder of granite to the town's
upper goat pasture.  A pair of red-billed steelbirds kept pace with
them for a time, clacking their beaks to warn the Avauntois away from
their nest.  Boot soles clomped on stone while the wind slipped cold
fingers down the travelers' collars, toying with their scarves and
rustling the branches around them.

Erileine was sweating by the time they reached the pasture. Pine
branches woven through sturdy uprights closed off two of its
sides. Goats bleated behind the prickly wall, their brown and white
coats half-visible through the barrier. The cliff that formed the
pasture's third side was too steep even for them to climb, although a
creeping vine from the jungle below Mau Ngapcha had made a nest just
out of reach of their hungry mouths. Erileine paused a moment to watch
it wave its sweetly-scented flowers at a rabbit. Come closer, come
closer, they seemed to beckon. Come to me... The rabbit scampered
away.

The road narrowed beyond the pasture, forcing the townspeople to walk
single file.  It cut back and forth like Slip Street as it climbed.
"Need to fix that," the bosun grunted, shaking a wobbly pine railing
with his hand.  Laeuc just nodded.  Despite his protests, Elaiene had
insisted that he carry waterproofs for himself and Erileine, and he
was puffing under their weight.  He'd walked to Forecastle and back in
a single day once to get his wife a naming day present.  He didn't
remember it being so hard then...

They stopped to rest when the road leveled off. Erileine turned and
looked back the way they had come. All he could see of Starboard Town
was the roof of the Captain's House and a few household kites. In the
distance, a herd of clouds was raining on the plains below. *At least
_they_ have water*, Erileine thought.

"Do you think they know?" he asked no one in particular. "Down below, I
mean. That we're off course?"

"They know," the bosun said firmly. "Can't move a mountain around
without people noticing."

Razi nodded. Despite the die-hard patches of snow lurking among the
rocks, his feet were bare in his thick-soled desert sandals, though he
had tied the wrist strings of his *deel*, and belted it more tightly
around his waist to keep the warmth in. "*La*, it will be like the
tale of the camel in the crib. There will be meetings---kings and
princes, ministers and magicians, all twittering at each other like
birds.  What does it mean, who will advantage by it...  Heh." He
sniggered like a little boy who has heard a dirty joke.

"Glad you find it funny," Donaien said a little sourly. "Can't say I
see the joke myself."

Razi spread his hands. "I am sorry to give offense. But I spent some
time as a clerk below the court at Armaq when I was younger, and oh,
they are all so serious. Even when there is nothing they can do, they
must write each other letters." He laughed suddenly. "*La*, perhaps
*especially* when there is nothing they can do.  Like the King of
Nyengmo and the three pigs. Do you know the story?"  Donaien shook his
head. "No? Well, if I may as we walk?"

Donaien shouldered his pack and waved Razi on. "After you."

Razi dipped his head. "Thank you. Now, many of my stories are not
true, but this is a true story. The king in question, Phuntsok, was a
very fat man..."

A hundred strides later Erileine's ears were burning. She was glad her
mother wasn't there, although the women within earshot were laughing
as hard as the men. When Razi started imitating voices---the squeaky
Minister of Law, saying that the pigs would have to marry, and the
stuttering Minister of Rumors, saying that her desk had never been so
clean---the bosun had to lean against trees and hold his sides.

"So you see," Razi finished, ducking a low-hanging branch, "You are
very lucky, here on your mountain. You have a captain, *la*, who is
wise enough to know that if he cannot steer his ship, he should not
pretend to, and a bosun in each town to make sure children spend their
days pulling up weeds instead of getting into trouble---"

"Or both," the bosun said, still chuckling.

"*La*, or both," Razi agreed.  "But please, I have burdened you with a
story---perhaps I could carry one of yours in return?"

"Do you know how Papaere Vurt lost his foot?" Erileine asked before
anyone else could speak. When Razi shook his head, Erileine pointed up
the mountain's side. "It was up there, in one of the old tunnels.
Bosun Uyves' father was there---he was a bosun's mate, wasn't he?"

"That he was," Uyves said, wiping the damp off his moustache. "It was,
what, forty years ago? Forty-one, now..."

*The bonescuttle whose skull would eventually hang above Vurt's
fireplace was what brought him to Avaunt.  They were patient
creatures, slow-moving until prey was in reach, then as fast as a
striking snaek. No one knew how this one had found its way onto the
mountain---an egg lying unnoticed in a sack of chocolate beans,
perhaps, or some angry Bantangui merchant trying to sabotage a
rival. It just appeared one day, fully grown and very hungry.*

*It took goats at first, dragging them back to its lair to dismember.
Then it took a Hett boy, the son of tinkers who had made camp outside
Forecastle. A few people said, "Better them than our goats," and more
thought it without saying it, but they all knew that the bonescuttle
wouldn't care whether the next child was Hett or not.*

*So Forecastle bosun and several of his mates went hunting.  Tracking
the bonescuttle was easy, but when the trail led to the mouth of an
old tunnel, he and his men stopped. Like all Avauntois, they had spent
their lives under an open sky, with the whole world spread out below
them.  They stored trade goods in the shallowest tunnels, but the
thought of going into their depth... Of having such a weight of stone
over their heads... No. Unable to meet one another's eyes, they turned
back. This wasn't a job for an Avauntois.*

*Vurt was twenty-four then. His parents had been taken the year before
when scribbling fever swept across the Karaband. They had left him a
small house and a rat catching business whose clients were as poor as
themselves.*

*Unable to bear the house's emptiness, Vurt sold it for half what it
had been worth a year before---it was a poor market, when so many
stood empty.  He was on his way to Tomb Hill to look for work as a
caravan guard when he saw a palace clerk painting a notice on the wall
in Six Ears Square. The Captain of Avaunt...  a bonescuttle...
passage there and back to be provided by the emir to any qualified
applicant...  He looked up at the blue sky over his head, and thought,
why not? He'd killed one of the things before.*

*The next morning, he found himself on the back of a small cloud,
sweating in the heavy coat and fleece-lined trousers that the
cloudherd swore he would need once they got higher.  He cried out in
wonder and fear when the cloud rose into the air. He had played on
Coriandel's rooftops, and climbed trees, but this---this was how the
sun and the moon saw the world.*

* "First time?" the cloudherd asked.*

*"Yup."*

*"Well, if you're going to sick up, do it over the side. Squabbles
here hates being puked on."*

*The mountain swelled as they approached it. Its irregular peak was
stone gray and ice bright; its lower reaches were dense with
vegetation. And there, directly ahead, a town clung to its side like a
burr to a camel.*

*The cloudherd set him down in a goat pasture. Bunched together at the
fence in the hope that he might have carrot greens for them, the goats
watched as he shouldered his bags and went looking for someone who
could tell him what he was supposed to do as the cloud lifted off once
again.*

*The first villager Vurt met didn't speak Karabandi. Neither did the
second, or the third. It wasn't until he pulled a steel trap out of
his bag and waved it in their faces that the Avauntois realized their
savior had arrived.*

*It didn't take Vurt long to realize how much the Avauntois disliked
the tunnels. Truth be told, he didn't like them either. They reminded
him of the night he had spent beneath Coriandel, hunting his first
bonescuttle.  The way their floors and walls and ceilings were tilted
made it worse: at some point in the distant past, the mountain had
tipped back so that floor were angled ramps and stairs were saw-edged
traps.*

*Vurt was setting the last of his traps when word came that the
bonescuttle had taken another goat. Grim-faced, Starboard Town's bosun
led Vurt to the scene. The creature had cut through the thorny wall
around the pasture. A drying pool of blood showed where it had caught
hold of its prey. More blood speckled a shallow furrow that led to
half of the goat's remains.*

*Vurt put his hand on the still-warm carcass and looked helplessly at
the woods around them. He had spent his whole life in the desert---he
didn't know how to track something among trees. "What way go?"  he
asked the bosun in bad Gandan-o.*

*The bosun pointed. Vurt stood and wiped his hand on his
trousers. "I follow."*

*The trail led to a tunnel mouth. The bushes growing around it seemed
undisturbed, but scratches on the stones showed where the creature had
sharpened its pincers.*

*Vurt unslung his crossbow. Its quarrels were tipped with steel barbs
that hooked cruelly backward. His father had bought them years before
but never used them. He ran a quick loop of spider silk through the
eyelet at the quarrel's base, knotted it, and handed the coil to the
bosun. "Good?" Vurt asked.*

*The bosun shook his head. "No. Let's go."*

*Twenty strides in, Vurt raised his hand to signal stop. Up ahead, he
heard the sound of pincers stripping flesh from a goat's leg to make
morsels small enough for a tiny mouth.*

*Vurt tapped the bosun on the shoulder. "I loud, you pull, yes?" he
whispered, twitching the silk line trailing from his quarrel to
illustrate.*

*The bosun raised his fist to his ear and nodded. Hoping that meant,
"I understand," Vurt edged forward gingerly, one foot on the tilted
floor, the other on the steeply-angled wall beside it.*

*The sound ahead of him suddenly stopped. Vurt raised his crossbow to
his shoulder and thumbed open the shutter on his little dayglass
lantern.*

*The bonescuttle froze in the sudden light, blinking its too-human eyes.
Its scorpion tail twitched above its back, and then it charged.*

*Vurt fired. The quarrel hit the bonescuttle with a crack. "Pull!"
Vurt yelled. "Pull pull pull!" He swung his crossbow at the
bonescuttle's head like an ax as the bonescuttle caught his left leg
with its pincer.*

*Vurt screamed and fell backward as the bosun and his men dragged the
bonescuttle on top of him. He covered his head with his arms as its
fleshless legs stabbed the stone on either side of him, then drove his
knife up between the plates on the creature's belly. Screaming in
terror and fury, he pulled his knife free and stabbed it again and
again.*

*The next thing he knew, the bosun was dragging him out of the tunnel.
"Is it? Is it?" Vurt gasped, not knowing the Gandan-o for "dead".*

*One of the men held up the bonescuttle's severedhead. Vurt nodded and
fainted.*

*The emir's doctress in Coriandel could have saved his nearly-severed
leg. The Avauntois in Starboard Town couldn't. Vurt lay in bed shaking
with fever for a week. When he woke, a woman was sitting on a stool
beside his cot, grinding herbs with a pestle and mortar. She soaked
the bandages on his stump in warm water to loosen them, then unwrapped
them slowly and carefully so that she could pack more herbs onto the
bloody ruin below his knee. He said, "Thank you" in Karabandi, and
slept again.*

*By the time he could stand he had learned how to say, "Thank you," in
Gandan-o, and a great many other things as well. They sat for hours on
the wodden deck behind the small house the town had loaned him,
looking down the steep, twist-back street to the world passing slowly
below.  Coriandel was three hundred gallops behind them. The desert
had given way to chaparral, which was itself turning into the forest
that covered the northern arch of the Brumoso Mountains. When Vurt
asked his nurse how to say, "I would like to marry you," she laughed
and kissed him for the first time.*

Razi nodded through the bosun's story, while Laeuc, Erileine, and
everyone else walking within earshot chipped in with corrections and
elaborations.  "*La*, and no one ever found out where the creature
came from?"

Uyves glanced at Laeuc. "Not that I ever heard of."

Laeuc shook his head. "Nor me.  After he was walking, Vurt went back
into the tunnel to bring out the bones of the Hett boy.  Never heard
him that say he found anything else."

"I didn't know he went back," Erileine said.

The bosun shrugged. "No reason to think the boy would turn haunt, but
no point taking chances."

The travelers fell silent after that. They were above the treeline,
and each breath was a cloud of steam that turned to tiny ice crystals
in people's nostrils. Everyone except Razi had put on gloves and
pulled the flaps of their hats down over their ears.

Despite the cold, the view was magnificent. Crabby old patches of ice
dazzled white in the early afternoon sun. Below, gray stone and
green-brown moss gave way to dwarf pines, sea-blue spruce, and braided
pines, their triple trunks twined together. A little melt-stream
called splashed foam-white through tiny rapids to fall into the small
pool made by an ancient dam, then tumbled down the mountain once again
to fall into space, a tiny echo of the rivers that legend said fell
into infinity over the side of the world.

"Who's that down there?" Donaien pointed to the campground next to the
dam. Erileine caught a glimpse of a two bent figures hurrying into the
trees, shouldering their heavy packs as they went.

"*La*, is that not the tinker and his apprentice?" Razi asked.

Bosun Uyves scowled. "Aye. Probably spent the night here. He knows
that's not allowed."

Razi's eyebrows went up fractionally. "No?"

"Nope. Law says they can't settle anywhere on the mountain."

Razi's eyebrows climbed even further. "And camping overnight in such a
place is considered 'settling'?"

"Anywhere there's stonework," Donaien said, before the bosun could
reply. He spat off the side of the road. "That's the law, not that it
counts for much these days. One of them owns a whole house now in
Forecastle.  Captain pretends not to see, but---"

"What the captain sees and doesn't see isn't for you or me to have
words about," the bosun said sharply. "I'll gnaw on Vaszlav's ear the
next time he's in town. You want to make any more out of it, take it
to the Debates. Now, come on. I'm hungry."

As the travelers picked their way down to the campground the Hett had
just fled, Razi stopped a moment to adjust his sandal strap,
straightening up as Erileine went past. "*La*, so, are you in the mood
for a history lesson?" the bookster asked.

"Sure. I mean, yes, thank you, bookster."

"So, the tale begins with Yegor the First, who was king in Uws when
your people came to the mountain." The bookster pushed a branch out of
his way, his voice slipping into its familiar lecturing tone. "He gave
the Hett refuge, and appointed several to his council. His son,
however---this is Yegor the Second, also called Yegor the Sharp---he
believed the Hett knew the lost secrets of the Pilots, so when he put
on the collar, he demanded that they tell him. When they said they
knew no more than anyone else, he ordered them expelled. 'By evening
three days hence,' according to the official chronicle, 'They shall be
outwith the borders of our kingdom, taking no more than they
brought.'"

"So what happened?" Erileine asked.

The bookster sighed. "*La*, having been driven from their homes once
already, the Hett felt disinclined to obey. They put up barricades,
and fought with all the fury of people who have no more to lose. Which
was perhaps the Sharp's goal all along. The Sarkoszys were no longer
as secure upon their throne as they had been. He would not have been
the first king to find himself in need of an enemy. The Hett were
already unpopular---they were better smiths than the Uwsians, and many
had grown wealthy. Once the first stones were thrown, the rest..."

He paused a moment, his eyes focused on the distance. "Those who fled
north into Ruuda were taken apart by the Pale Remainder. Those who
went south to Praczedt, *la*, wherever they went, they found Yegor the
Sharp's story of their 'secret knowledge' waiting for them."

"Sounds like you have a soft spot for the Hett." Laeuc's voice behind
them gave Erileine a jolt. How long had her father been listening?

But Razi was unperturbed. "They are an interesting people. *La*,
merely the fact that they *are* a people, after centuries without a
home, makes them interesting."

"Well, best to keep that interest to yourself, at least in company."
Laeuc nodded at the campground ahead of them, where a double dozen
Starboard Towners were already eating hard bread and dried fruit.
Donaien, Armaend, and the bosun had a fire going, and were talking in
low voices as they waited for their kettle to boil. "Most people don't
feel as charitable toward them as you do."

"Of course." Razi dipped his head. "I shall endeavor to be more
circumspect in future." Which was not, Erileine thought, the same
thing as saying that he'd stop talking about it.

---

Erileine's legs were aching by the time they crested the spur of rock
called the Cripple's Shoulder to find Forecastle spread out below
them.  He had been disappointed the first time he saw Avaunt's
capitol---it had seemed small compared to the cities he had looked
down on from his grandfather's verandah.  But then his father had led
him down the last half-gallop of road, and the realness of it had
taken his breath away.  It wasn't a picture in a book, or a map, or a
giant's toy on the ground a gallop below.  It was a bustling,
prosperous town.  A few goats nipped at rooftop moss, ignoring the
smoke that rose from the chimneys around them, while chickens cackled
in wicker coops against the side of every second house, but that was
where the resemblance to Starboard Town ended.  Starboard Town's homes
didn't have glass windows.  Its shops didn't have banners strung
proudly over their doors proclaiming the quality of the wares within.
And if Starboard Towners wore silk, it was just an accent laid over
plain cotton, not a whole shirt or a broad, brightly-colored skirt.

Forecastle Road's last half-gallop wound through a pine tree
plantation.  Thin smears of black smoke rose from charcoaling sheds on
either side.  A handful of arborists stripping bark off
recently-felled trees waved to the Starboard Towners.  One, a young
woman with her hair pulled back in a thick club, set her root drill on
the ground and trotted over to say hello to the bosun.  He waved his
companions on.  "I'll catch up with you," he said to knowing grins
from Laeuc and a few others.

The forest ended abruptly a few minutes later.  Thirty strides away,
on the other side of the firebreak, brick and timber buildings lined
cart-wide streets that turned back on themselves like tangled yarn.
Here, the afternoon sun turned a carp pond silver.  There, a vanity
garden tumbled down a wall, rank upon rank of flowers standing bright
and proud in defiance of the impending drought.

The travelers dispersed the moment they arrived, some to visit family,
others hurrying straight to particular shops.  The Forecastlers who
greeted them seemed cheerful enough, but the second thing out of their
mouths was invariably, "We don't know either."  The third was usually,
"You won't like the price." In the two and a half days since the
mountain had changed course, people had been buying all the flour,
smoked cheese, and dried fruit they could find.  Candles, too, and
cotton for bandages, and jars for storing water.  Prices had gone up
like kites in a strong wind.

"Everyone got all panicky," an old woman grumbled when Laeuc,
Erileine, and the bookster stopped to look at the preserves she was
selling.  Her expression was as dark as the blackberry stains on her
fingers.  "What's happening, where are we going, what if the water
runs out, on and on and on.  Feh." She spat the gooey remains of the
cinnamon bark she'd been chewing into a cracked mug.  "The Hett got
right onto it too, of course.  That Klaues fellow, he was in Market
Square in a heartbeat, splashing silver around and tossing what-not
into his wheelbarrow while everyone else was still picking themselves
up."

"Didn't the captain do anything?" Laeuc asked.

She made a face.  "Kind of like asking whether your fingers'll do
something about your thumb, isn't it? But you mark me---things keep
going on like this, the captain'll have to do something whether he
wants to or not."

Whether he wants to or not...  It had never occurred to Erileine that
people could ever force the captain to do something.  The thought felt
as strange as someone else's shoes...

She nearly bumped into her father when Laeuc pulled up short outside a
glasswright's to greet a familiar balding man with a broad smile on
his face, a baby on his hip, and a bundle of cured brown bamboo under
his arm.  "Regi! Clear day to you too.  Bookster, this is my brother
Reginael.  Regi, this is Bookster Razi, Erileine's master.  And who's
this? Oh, now, you can't be Annanette, can you?  When did you get to
be so big, eh?"

Razi caught Erileine's eye and smiled as Laeuc made faces at the
wide-eyed baby girl.  Erileine fidgeted from foot to foot until she
could take it no more.  "Paere? Can we...?"

"Hm?  Oh, of course." Laeuc tousled his daughter's hair fondly.  "You
go ahead, and I'll se you at the Green Pig at sundown.  Do you
remember how to get to there? Are you sure? No, don't scowl, I'm just
asking."

"I'm not scowling." Erileine scowled. "Do you want me to get
anything?"

"How about something for Queçenne?  No more than a quarter bezel,
though.  And not a hair ribbon," he added hastily.

Erileine and Razi left Laeuc making faces at his chubby-cheeked niece.
The bookster seemed to be in no hurry, and Erileine was happy to amble
along beside him.  Here and there, people had built rooms right over
the street, joining houses on opposite sides to create arches.
Mountain swallows whistled at frustrated cats from stick-and-mud nests
on the undersides.  Erileine heard a snatch of Uwsian (at least, she
thought it was Uwsian) from two pale-skinned men arguing amicably on a
bench outside a chocolate seller's.  A dozen strides further on, an
old woman with nimble fingers made a marionette dance and tumble,
nodding solemn thanks every time a coin clinked into the tray at her
feet.  So what if there weren't many kites in the sky as there were
over Starboard Town, or if some of the cobblestones needed weeding,
and some of the narrow alleys they passed smelled of damp garbage?  It
seemed that Forecastle had something new to show her every time they
turned the corner.

Drumlurch Street led to Three Bees Alley, which opened onto a third
street whose name Erileine didn't know that took them up a steep
flight of stairs built against the side of a warehouse past a
barber's, a loom mender's, and a prosperous little Bantangui-style tea
house where chili merchants bought, sold, and speculated day and night
when the mountain was on the ground.

As they rounded yet another corner, Razi said, "*La*, is that not the
bosun?"

Erileine grinned.  "I guess he has a lot of people to talk to." At
that particular moment, Uyves was talking to another young woman, one
whose almond eyes and long fingers showed Bantangui ancestry.  He
nodded at something she said and touched her arm lightly in farewell.

"Hoa!" He jumped slightly when he turned to find Razi and Erileine
standing behind him.  "Well, there you are," he said to Razi.  "I was
wondering where everyone had gone."

"*La*, to market, I believe.  That is why we came, is it not?" the
bookster replied blandly.

Uyves grinned.  "Well then, lead on."

The market lay in the center of town under the watchful gaze of a
sprawling, turreted building called the Hardeck.  The captain's clerks
and mates had their offices on its bottom two floors, while the
captain himself lived on the third, in a suite of rooms that were
supposed to be as richly decorated as the king's own chambers in
Gandan.  Gazing at the Hardeck's gray slate roof, Erileine wondered
where the captain was at that very moment.  Standing in front of the
famous window in the Grand Hall, watching the world roll by? Or
sitting at a desk somewhere, reading reports and writing orders? *I
wonder if he knows about Fraederiq?* Erileine thought, suddenly guilty
that she hadn't thought of him since they arrived.

The market itself was as busy as a goat pen at shearing time.  People
from Portside and Aft Landing jostled against second cousins from
Forecastle and Starboard Landing, all of them filling their bags with
anything that wouldn't spoil.  "Five sequins for a jar of plums!"
Erileine said to Razi, scandalized, when the bosun stopped to clasp
hands with someone Erileine didn't know.  "My maere would have a dog!"

Razi shook his head.  "*Masa il-kutna duttaqun as saa.* Have I taught
you that yet? It is Karabandi.  It means, fill your water jars, a
storm is coming."

Erileine looked around.  No one was smiling.  Everyone's voice had an
edge---not the customary mock-scandalized market-day edge, but
something harsher.  He suddenly remembered his papaere's stories about
his teacher, who had lived through the siege of Armaq.  "Once the last
of the cats were gone, people ate rats," Vurt told his wide-eyed
granddaughter one evening when Erileine's parents were safely out of
earshot.  "And when the rats were gone, they ate each other, one
mouthful at a time..."

"You think there's going to be a storm?" the bosun asked, having heard
only the bookster's last few words.

"*La*, perhaps when we reach the mountains," Razi replied.  "If we
have to go higher to get over them, would we not---*teh!*" Without
warning, he lunged forward to catch a grimy collar.

"Ow!" A small figure struggled furiously, trying to slip out of the
oversized coat the bookster had caught.  "Let go of me!"

"Oy, what's going on here?" the bosun asked.

"I didn't do anything! He just grabbed me! Stinking groundling! Let
go!"  The boy Razi had grabbed was a head shorter than Erileine, his
curly dark hair hacked short below his ears.  His grimy coat was two
sizes too large for him, but his waxed Bantangui sailing trousers left
a handspan of bare copper-colored ankle above his split-seamed shoes.

Razi shook him.  "*La*, not until you give the nice gentleman his
wallet back, yes?"

The bosun patted his coat.  "Hoy!"

The bookster pushed the boy in front of the bosun.  "It is in his left
pocket."

Stony-faced, the bosun slapped the boy's hands out of the way and
pulled his wallet out of the boy's coat.  "I didn't do it!"  he
yelped.  "He put it there! Stinking wormy---"

"Quiet!" the bosun bellowed, red-faced.  People around them stared at
the scene, some grinning, some tsk'ing under their breath.

The boy subsided, glaring.  The bosun took his collar from Razi.
"Thank you, bookster.  I'm sure the captain will want to have a word
with our little ragtagger."

Without warning, the boy bent double and pulled his arms free from his
jacket.  As he darted away, Erileine instinctively stuck out her foot.

"Ooph!" Down he went.  The bosun pounced on him.  "Let go of me, you
sock-clutching bent-masted..." His stream of curses set the people
nearby laughing.

Not the bosun, though.  Erileine thought steam was going to start
coming out of his ears.  "Right," he said grimly, "If you want to play
the goat..." He pulled a twist of cord out of his pocket and twisted
the boy's arms behind her back.  "There? Happy now?" he asked as he
tied the boy's wrists together.

He glared at him, then at Razi, and then spat at Erileine's feet.
Muttering under his breath, the bosun pushed him toward the Hardeck.
"Come on," he said over his shoulder.

"*La*, that was well done," Razi said approvingly.

"Thanks," Erileine muttered.  If she had moved that quickly two days
before, Fraederiq might still be alive...

Instead of marching his prisoner up the broad steps that led to the
Hardeck's front doors, the bosun half-dragged him to a smaller door
that stood in a shadowed recess at ground level.  When he yanked the
dangling cord, a drum thubbed inside.

"Prisoner for charge," he told the uniformed guard who opened the door
a moment later, pushing the boy inside ahead of him.  Erileine and
Razi followed them.

Erileine had never realized that arresting someone involved so much
writing.  Even Razi's patient smile eventually grew forced.  "*La*,
you would think we were in Thind," he muttered as the clerk scribbled
in yet another ledger.

"Sorry," the clerk said unapologetically, handing the ledger book to
Bosun Uyves to sign.  "Procedures, you know.  Must say, I'm glad we
don't have to go through this very often when we're in the air.  At
least, we didn't until this one started showing up."

The bosun looked up.  "You know him?"

The clerk sighed theatrically.  "Oh yes.  I doubt another night in the
dungeon will scare any sense into him, but we'll give it a try.  Thank
you.  Now, can you initial here and here, please?"

Erileine glanced at the boy, who was sitting on a stool in the corner
of the cold stone room with his hands still tied behind his back and
his coat on the floor beside him.  She hadn't known the Hardeck *had*
a dungeon.  He didn't look as though the thought of spending a night
in it scared him.  He looked as if he wanted to bite someone's head
off.

The clerk inked a round stamp and rolled it carefully across the
bosun's signature.  "I think, yes, that should be everything.  No, a
moment, there's---no, no, that's all.  Thank you, bosun." He stood and
nodded.  "Now, you said you wanted to speak to the captain? Yes? Good.
He should be upstairs.  You know the way?"

* * *

The captain was indeed upstairs---three flights of polished granite
stairs, to be exact.  The brass handrail beside them had been worn
shiny-smooth by generations of hands.  Clerks in blue jackets bustled
past the trio from Starboard Town, squawking "shortage" and
"inventory" to one another like strange flightless birds.

Erileine was so busy gawking at the tapestries on the walls and the
statues frowning sternly between them that she stumbled on every tenth
step.  Most of the tapestries were brightly-painted silk from Ini
Bantang and Barra Bantang, though some had faded with age---great age,
she thought, gazing at a bird's-eye view of what could only be the
sunken city of Plange.

"Quite the sight, isn't it?" Bosun Uyves said proudly.

Erileine nodded.  "What's that one?" he asked, pointing.

The bosun shrugged cheerfully.  "Not a clue.  Bookster?"

Razi studied the tapestry.  Glass windows stretched from head-height
to the ceiling at regular intervals, but even so, the building's
interior was growing dim as evening approached.  "The Parliament of
Whales, I believe.  Not bad work." He gestured at the one next to it.
"This, on the other hand, is Ossisswean.  See here? The squares in the
corner? *La*, those are the painter's sign.  It is bad luck to put
one's name on someone else's image, so portraitists mark their work
after this fashion.  Now, you notice the way the subject's hands are
clasped in front of his chest? In a formal portrait such as this---"

The bosun cleared his throat noisily.  "Sorry, bookster, but you'd
best save the lesson for some other time.  Wouldn't want to keep the
captain waiting."

Despite his own words, the bosun still paused for a few moments at the
top of the stairs to straighten his jacket and run his fingers through
his hair before thumping the little door drum.  "Enter," a deep voice
said.

"Oh..." Erileine gasped.  They were in the Grand Hall---the *Grand
Hall*.  One entire wall was a single enormous window.  Below it, the
Hardeck dropped vertically to the steep cliff that formed the
mountain's leading edge.  The great window curved slightly, so if you
stood close to its center and looked straight ahead, you saw nothing
except sky.

Paintings from all over Cherne covered the room's rear wall.  Delicate
yet indestructible ruins from the time of the Pilots, the sun rising
over a glacier in Anuvatik, tigers and courtiers in mirrored masks
listening to music on board a palace barge in Thind...  If Erileine
had looked more closely, she would have realized that none of them
showed Gandan, Mau Ngapcha, or anywhere else the mountain flew over.
Generations of captains had collected pictures of scenes they never
thought to see out their front window.

"Good afternoon, bosun." Erileine jumped.  She hadn't noticed the two
men standing in the corner.

The bosun saluted, nudging Erileine with his elbow to do likewise.
"Good afternoon, *sra*."

The captain returned the salute sharply.  He was stocky and
broad-shouldered, older than Erileine's paere but younger than Papaere
Vurt.  What was left of his close-cropped hair was shot through with
gray, and the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes had been etched by
the sun and endless, patient argument.

The man beside him was taller and lighter, with blue-gray eyes and a
neat mustache.  His high-collared knee-length jacket and trousers were
simply cut, but absorbed the light in a way that hinted at expensive
fabric and fine tailoring, and the lines on his face had been put
there by a lifetime of smiling.

The captain gestured at the paintings.  "I was just asking Klaues what
he thought the odds were that the next captain would have to hang
pictures of Gandan Berth and Mau Ngapcha up there some day.  Any
thoughts on that, bosun?"

"None, *sra*," Uyves said.  "Afternoon, Klaues.  Been arrested
lately?"

The Hett smiled.  "Six days a week, bosun, six days a week.  Any
chance you'll have time for another game of cards this trip? I
wouldn't mind a chance to get some of my sequins back."

"Plans made, I'm afraid," the bosun replied affably.

The captain cleared his throat.  "I understand you had some excitement
on the way here?"

"Just a little ragtagger, *sra*.  The bookster snagged him, not me."

"Mm." The captain cocked an eyebrow at Razi.  "Anything I should
concern myself with?"

The bookster turned his hands palms-up.  "*La*, your clerk was
pondering a night in the dungeons and some scrubbing of cobblestones."

The captain snorted.  "Bucket full of good that's done in the past.
Anyway, I'm glad you've come---there's a few things I'd like to ask
you.  If you'll follow me?  Bosun, you are of course welcome to join
us."

Bosun Uyves cleared his throat.  "Thank you, *sra*, but with your
permission, I *do* have some other matters I'd like to look in on
while I'm here"

Erileine saw Klaues stifle a smile as the captain said, "Of course.
Go finish your, um, rounds."

"Thank you, *sra*." The bosun saluted once again and left, humming
softly.

Razi and Erileine followed the captain and Klaues through a side door
to a normal-sized room with normal-sized windows, a low Bantangui
table, and comfortable chairs.  Very comfortable chairs, Erileine
thought, sinking into one moments after the three adults.  She climbed
Slip Street a dozen times every day, but even so, the long walk from
Starboard Town had worn her out.  She wondered if there'd be time to
visit a steam bath before dinner.  *Probably not*, she decided
regretfully.

There was chocolate, though.  An old man in a spotless blue jacket
poured for them and left.  The captain and Klaues picked theirs up and
blew on them gently, but Razi ignored his, so Erileine left hers alone
as well.

"So," the captain said.  "Bookster.  I don't suppose you've turned up
anything that might be of use?"

Razi spread his hands apologetically.  "*La*, not so much as I had
hoped.  I did find an account from Anuvatik of a stone boat that
sailed to the moon and back.  The author---she doesn't give her own
name, but from the style, I would guess her to have been from
Vaarda---said that the boat made the journey several times before
disappearing."

The captain drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair.  "Hm.  What
do you think of it?"

Razi sighed.  "To be honest, I rather suspect it was just a traveler's
tale about Avaunt grown garbled with time and distance.  As I have
been telling my apprentice, being written does not make a thing true."

"I wish more people shared your scepticism," Klaues said regretfully.
"Here.  Have these shown up in Starboard Town yet?"

He took a sheet of cheap gray paper from his pocket and passed it to
Razi.  Erileine craned her neck to look.  The printing was rough and
slightly smeared, but the message was plain.  "The Committee of
Twenty-Nine," Razi read aloud.  "Because there are twenty-nine of
them?"

"Question twenty-nine from the last Debates," the captain grunted.
"About how many Hett should be allowed on the mountain."

"They've gone further this time," Klaues said quietly.  "No Hett on
the mountain at all."

Razi stroked his chin with his fingertips.  "Will they have the voices
they need?"

The Hett shrugged.  "Who can say? Four days ago, I would have said we
had left this behind us.  Now? Two of my nephews have had stones
thrown at them in the streets.  Somehow, people seem to think that
what happened on Orangeday is our doing." He laughed.  "It apparently
hasn't occurred to them that if we have magic enough to move the
mountain off its path, throwing stones at us would be less than wise."

"And speaking of magic..." The captain steepled his hands under his
chin.  "Do you know a magician named Thomas?"

Razi smiled broadly.  "Of course! Do you also?"

"He arrived just before dawn, in some damned flying sailboat.  Scared
the roof goats half to death, and the militia, too.  Apparently Lady
Jangchup---she's the King's Hand these days---is worried enough about
us changing course to send her chief magician hawking after us under
full sail."

Razi laughed.  "*La*, so is old Barramarrabee dead then? And Roderick
the Rhymer also?"

"*Her* chief magician, not the king's," the captain emphasized.  "He
was very careful to make that distinction.  'Not speaking on behalf of
the Throne and Collar', and so on.  Anyway, he had a few things to say
when I mentioned you were here."

Razi nodded.  "I imagine he would.  We are not friends."

"I gathered that." The captain lifted his cup to his lips.  "But from
what he tells me, you and Lady Kembe are."

Erileine's breath caught.  Lady Kembe was the most powerful magician
in the Karaband---some said in the whole world.  There weren't just
stories about here, there were *legends*.

Razi met the captain's sharp eyes.  "Am I accused of anything?"

"Accused? No.  But when you boarded in Mau Ngapcha, all you told me
was that you wanted to see what was in the Captain's House library.
There was no mention of you being Lady Kembe's fetch."

"I am no one's fetch." Razi didn't raise his voice, but his tone could
have struck sparks off flint.  "I have served her from time to time,
as I would serve anyone else who wanted old books found and read, but
I am not, and never have been, soul-ridden.  If Thomas says otherwise,
I call him a liar."

The silence that followed stretched as tight as Klaues's smile.  The
captain finally broke it with a sigh.  "Fair enough," he grumbled.
"But you could have said."

Razi spread his hands.  "*La*, there is always much that could be
said, and is not.  And much that is said, that---"

The captain waved him into silence. "Don't get philosophical on me.
Mind telling me what it is between you two?"

"He tried to kill my previous apprentice," Razi said calmly.  "It is
not the sort of thing one easily sets aside."

The captain looked at Erileine as if she was something Razi had
brought with him from the market.  "I imagine not."

"Tell him about the picture," Klaues said.

"I'm getting there," the captain said testily.  "Here---what do you
make of this?" He picked a book up off on the table and passed it to
Razi.

The bookster studied the page in front of him for a moment before
tilting it so that Erileine could see a tinted sketch of a small
village in a mountain valley.  "Ruudian," the bookster said after a
moment.  "See the blues? And the way the trees are just sticks on a
green background?" Suddenly he laughed.  "*La,* and of course the
artist has signed it, which helps.  Larren Mehgasdottir...  I don't
know the name, but from the style, I would guess it to be a hundred
years old, perhaps somewhat less."

"Mm hm." The captain sipped his chocolate.  "Notice anything special
about it?"

Razi shook his head.  Erileine started to shake hers as well, then
hesitated.  There was something familiar about the scene...  "It's
just like Gandan Berth!" she blurted.  "The big bowl the mountain sits
in!"

The captain nodded.  "That's what I said.  Thomas said some spell or
other pulled him to it.  If you flip the page over, it's called *The
Mine at Tinhead*."

"Which is where?" the bookster asked, still studying the picture.

"In Praczedt.  Upriver from Anyalcze.  About three weeks away at our
usual speed, as the parrot flies, though at the rate we're going, we
could be there in..."

"Five days," Klaues volunteered.

"Five days.  Don't suppose there's any mention of the place in any of
your books, is there?"

"*La*, they're actually your books," Razi corrected mildly.  "And no,
not that I recall, but we will certainly look."

"Please." The captain set his empty cup on the table.  "But keep it to
yourself until we know whether there's anything to it.  There's enough
rumors and what-not kiting around right now."

"On my blood," Razi said, dipping his head slightly.

"Thank you." The captain glanced at Erileine.

"Mine too," she said hastily.

The captain stood and tugged his jacket straight.  "Well then.  Thank
you for your time."

Setting the book on the table and standing in turn, Razi bowed
slightly.  "Thank *you*.  But may I ask, can you perhaps tell me where
Thomas is to be found? I should pay my respects."

The captain's brow furrowed.  "There'll be no blood shed on my
mountain, is that clear?"

Razi placed his right hand over his eyes.  "May I be struck blind."

"Hmph.  He's probably upstairs with the birds.  Said Lady Jangchup
wanted him to send word as soon as he arrived."

"*La*, then if I may excuse myself? Thank you.  *Sra* Klaues, good
afternoon.  Come, Erileine.  Let us say hello to our young magician."

---

Once upon a time, a captain of Avaunt fell in love with a young man
from Aft Landing.  She was twenty years his senior, but when they
spoke, she felt like a girl again.  But one day, as the mountain lay
berthed at Mau Ngapcha, he disappeared.  Some people say he went
looking for glass flowers to give her as a sign of his love.  Others
say he wanted to see more of the world than what passed below Avaunt,
or lacked the courage to tell the captain that he had tired of her.
Whether he was swallowed whole by a python, drained dry by
parasquitoes, or simply shaved off his mustache and changed his name,
he disappeared

In her grief, the captain locked herself away in the Hardeck's highest
room.  Day after lonely day she sat there, neither eating nor
sleeping, until that part of her that could leave this world did.

The room stood empty after that---her nephew, who became captain in
her wake, feared that she might return as a ghost.  Besides, his leg
hurt from a long-ago fall, and there were many stairs between the
Grand Hall and that room.

Some years later, a family of Gifted condors came to the mountain in
search of a new home.  They were northerners, with gray feathers and
sharp eyes, who had nested peacefully in the Brumoso Mountains their
whole lives.  (Peacefully, but not happily---condors are not naturally
cheerful creatures.) When the people of Ruuda overthrew their undead
masters, a wave of anti-Gifted sentiment swept the country.  Raccoons
argued that the anger would die down, and bears matter-of-factly said
that they would eat anyone who tried to harm them, but the condors
just spread their blunt wings and left their troubles behind.

The captain was happy to give them space: they could carry messages to
and from the surface, and even their ungifted progeny would help keep
the mountain's rabbits in check.  He had the room's window widened and
a screen put in to shelter the birds from the wind and rain.  Twice a
week, on Redsday and Greensday, one of the Hardeck's unluckier clerks
swept the rabbit bones on the floor into a sack for burning, refilled
the birds' water jug, and scraped their droppings off their roosting
posts with an old wooden spatula and a wrinkled nose.  New clerks
sometimes tried to chat with the room's residents, but Gifted condors
are hardly more talkative than their ungifted kin.  No one ever asked
the birds whether the captain's ghost haunted the room, and for their
part, they never saw any reason to say.

"By my eyes, a dozen rabbits, hung 'til they're as ripe as cheese! Two
dozen! Just go!"

"Nawp." The first voice was human, heavily accented, and exasperated.
The second was an indifferent rasp.  Razi smiled humorlessly and
thumped the door's drum.

"Yep?" the second voice squawked.

Razi pulled the door open and stepped into the room.  Erileine
followed, her mind still whirling.  Razi worked for Lady Kembe?  For
*Lady Kembe*?

"Ah, Razi! Hello, hello.  So very to see you again.  I've missed the
sound of your sandals behind me---they *are* the same ones, are they
not? Well made, I must say, to have lasted so long." The magician
appeared to be in his early twenties, with red-gold hair, blue eyes,
freckles, and the whitest teeth Erileine had ever seen.  He wore a
long black skirt and a rich brocade jacket, black and dark green with
red and gold thread twisting through it.  The pattern shifted slightly
each time Erileine blinked.

Razi bowed deeply, fluttering his hands through an elaborate desert
greeting.  "Thomas.  Welcome to Avaunt."

"Thank you, thank you.  You look well."

"As do you.  This is my apprentice, Erileine."

Thomas beamed, as if he had been waiting eagerly to meet some famous
wonder-worker.  "The pleasure, truly, the pleasure."  He folded his
hands in front of his chest.

"Hello," Erileine said awkwardly.

Thomas waited.  When she said nothing more, his smile broadened.  "A
woman of few words, eh? Like...  Like...  What was his name? The boy
from Medef? Eyeun?"

"Eimin," Razi corrected calmly.

"Of course, of course, Eimin.  Splendid fellow, very resourceful.  How
is he these days, do you know?"

"Studious.  Happy.  Alive.  And yourself?"

"Oh, alive as well, very much, and busy, busy, busy.  Lady Jangchup is
wonderful, really.  I am learning *so* much from her, and of course
one is grateful for a chance to serve one's fellows however one can."

"I'm sure one is," Razi repeated dryly.

Thomas raised a finger.  "Now, now, that's two unpleasantries in a
row---let's not have a third, shall we? There are serious matters
afoot here.  We can't afford to waste time bickering.  Speaking of
which..." He turned back to the condor, who had neither blinked nor
moved while the humans spoke.  "I believe we were discussing rabbits,
were we not?"

"Nawp," the condor squawked.

"Tsk tsk," Thomas clucked.  "I'm *sure* the captain would want my
letter to reach Lady Jangchup without delay.  I implore you---"

"Nawp." The condor shook her head.  She wasn't as ugly up close as
Erileine had expected.  Her beak was cruelly curved, and bald red skin
on her neck hung in loose wrinkles, but her eyes glittered like
mid-winter icicles, and the ruff of white feathers on her chest looked
as warm as a favorite sweater.  "Might not get back.  Might not know
where back was."

Thomas crossed his arms.  "By my eyes, they're as bad as the waiters
in Anyalcze," he said to Razi.  "Do you have any suggestions?  Wait!"
He snapped his fingers.  "Perhaps you could ask Lady Kembe to pass on
a message on my behalf? She *is* so much better at this kind of thing
than I am."

Razi raised his palms in apology.  "Perhaps the best thing would be if
you carried your message back to Gandan yourself."

Thomas's smile hardened.  Whatever riposte he would have made was
forestalled by wings rustling outside the window.  A moment later, a
second condor sidled into the room.  "Ehp," he squawked.

"Ehp," the first one replied.

"What do they want?" the newcomer asked.

"Message downbelow."

The second condor rustled his feathers.  "Nawp."

"Nawp," the first agreed.  They swiveled their heads in unison to fix
a double stare on Thomas.

"Well, then," the magician said in mock-exasperation that wasn't
really mock at all, "I suppose I'll just have to find some other way.
Thank you for your time." He turned back to Razi, still smiling.
"Razi---as always."

"And you." Razi raised his palms again.

"And good luck with your apprentice.  I hope her education is easier
than her predecessor's was." Thomas caught himself.  "Oh, but I forgot
to ask.  Exactly which of your many trades is this one studying?"

Razi raised his eyebrows at Erileine.  "I'm learning languages,"
Erileine said, feeling foolish.  "I want to be a bookster some day."

"Ah, how worthy.  I'm sure Lady Kembe will find that valuable."

"I'm not learning it for her." Even in his own ears, Erileine sounded
defensive.

"Of course not," Thomas agreed warmly.  "Well, clear day and *mingala
ba* to you both."

"Nasty," the second condor squawked after the door closed behind the
magician.

Razi laughed.  "*La*, yes, like ground glass in rice pudding." His
expression grew serious.  "But truly, are you not flying any messages
today? Or was that just for his benefit?"

"Nawp." The female condor's head bobbed from side to side.
"Mountain's moving too fast.  Might not be able to get back."

"I see," Razi said thoughtfully.  "Well, if you change your mind---for
anyone---I'm sure the captain would be grateful if you let him know."

The condor tilted her head to study Razi, as if trying to decide
whether he was a rabbit or a tiger.  "Ehp," she finally squawked,
meaning "yes" or "no", or "silly mammal, I already knew that" or
perhaps something entirely bird-ish that Erileine wouldn't have
understood.

She followed Razi down ten flights of stairs to the main floor,
breaking into a trot in places to keep up with the bookster's
long-legged stride.  "Was his jacket magic?" she asked when the
bookster finally slowed down enough for conversation.

"I'm afraid so," the bookster said over his shoulder.  "Have you ever
seen magic before?"

"Sure, a couple of times.  When Fraederiq---" Erileine swallowed.
"Fraederiq broke his arm when we were little.  We were playing dares
on a swing rope, trying to see who could get the highest, and he fell
off.  Gaeston walked up here to get the captain's wife, and she came
and did a spell so that Fraederiq's arm would mend straight." She saw
no reason to add that Fraederiq's father had waited almost a week.  By
the time she reached Starboard Town, his son had been drenched in
fever, and his arm had been mottled.  That had been just a few months
after Fraederiq's mother had left; Fraederiq's arguments with his
father had started almost as soon as he was well enough to stand
again.  "And there was a rock slide a couple of years ago when we
berthed in Mau Ngapcha.  The captain hired a Bantangui to make the
rocks dance themselves into a pile.  He used one of my paere's
flutes."

The bookster nodded.  "Well, unless the world has turned upside down
in the last ten years, you're going to see some more magic done today.
And *la*, there he is.  I'm surprised he doesn't hire a stage and a
crier so that the whole town can watch."

Thomas stood at the bottom of the broad steps in front of the Hardeck.
His brocade jacket hung in the air beside him, as if on an invisible
coat rack.  The market-day crowd had already formed a half-circle in
front of him.  They watched, hushing one another, as he folded a sheet
of creamy blue paper.

"What's he doing?" Erileine whispered.

Razi rolled his eyes.  "Performing," he said in a normal voice.  "He
lives for it, truly.  See?"

Sure enough, Thomas had folded the piece of paper to make a toy bird
small enough to nestle in the palm of his hand.  He raised it to his
lips and blew on it gently.  Its tiny wings fluttered, then flapped.
It rose from his palm and circled his head like a strange blue wasp.
A few people applauded.  Thomas whistled sharply.  The bird shot away
westward.  "Show-off," Razi grunted.

Thomas raised his arms over his head and whistled again.  His coat
flapped as if caught in a strong wind to settle neatly on his
shoulders.  Before Erileine's astonished eyes, the buttons did
themselves up.  Thomas smiled broadly as a few more people applauded,
then strolled toward the closest stall like a princess inspecting her
stables.

"Idiot." Razi shook his head.  "*La*, Erileine, truly, there is no one
as stupid as a clever man." He gathered his *deel* around him with one
hand and strode away.

Erileine followed him through the end-of-day bustle of the market
closing up.  Some vendors were disconsolately wrapping up the entire
stock they had brought that morning.  Buckles and straps for climbing
harnesses, copper jewelry set with colored glass, embroidery
thread---the worried Avauntois had barely glanced at them.  Those
selling onions, sacks of rice, cured peppers, palm oil, and rabbit
traps, on the other hand, had nothing to take home except jingling
strings of coins.  Some had raised their prices five times before
noon, and five times again before sunset.  "Scandalous!" people
exclaimed, but they paid.

Razi had to stop every dozen strides to let Erileine catch up.  When
they finally reached the narrow streets on the market's other side,
Razi glanced at her.  "So, do you know the way, or shall we ask
someone for directions?"

"I know the way."  But then the question that had been swelling in
Erileine's mind spilled out.  "Bookster---did you know the mountain
was going to change course?"

Her teacher blinked.  "By all the saints who laugh---whatever gave you
that idea?"

"I don't know." But Erileine *did* know, and somehow the ache in her
muscles from day's long walk gave him the courage to say, "It
just---it seems like too much for coincidence.  You coming here, and,
you know, what Thomas said." She shrugged uncomfortably.

Razi nodded.  "*La*, you mean the fact that I have worked for someone
as famous for meddling in the world as Lady Kembe?"

Erileine shrugged again.  "And the other night, when you said you were
meditating.  I heard you talking to someone, but there wasn't anyone
else in the room."

"*La*, that." Razi sighed.  "It had been a day for stories and
secrets, hasn't it? So, I will share one more with you, though I must
ask you to keep it to yourself.  You don't have to," he continued,
raising a hand to forestall whatever Erileine had been about to say.
"If you decide the captain really ought to know, then of course you
will tell him.  But..." He lowered his hand.  "It may be
nothing---just a grain of sand in her shoe.  *La*, and if she had any
name but her own, no one would pay it any attention.  I will therefore
ask you to think carefully before repeating what I tell you."

He waited, a lean dark figure in desert brown, standing in the early
evening half-light on a narrow cobbled street a thousand gallops from
the city of his birth, while his apprentice wrestled with her
conscience.  Finally Erileine nodded.  "All right."

"Thank you.  Lady Kembe has dreams sometimes, dreams that are more
than dreams.  These last few years, they have shown her people falling
from a great height and a shadow moving across the land.  It could
mean nothing.  It usually has, in the past---divination is a chancy
thing.  But still, better to search and not find than not to search.
Since she cannot come here herself..."  He turned his palms up.  "Here
I am."

Erileine scowled.  "So the captain was right.  You *are* her fetch."

Razi's hand was suddenly on Erileine's collar.  "I will say it again,"
he told his apprentice calmly.  "I am nobody's fetch, and never have
been.  Lady Kembe has done this world greater service than it
knows---*la*, greater than it deserves, I sometimes think---but if she
ever tried to bend my will, I would write her name on the wall just so
that I could piss on it.  I do this for her because if she is, then I
am afraid.  And if a smiling tapeworm like Thomas is crawling around
as well, then I am doubly afraid, because where she would act to keep
the world in balance, he would look only to see what advantage he
might find." He let go of Erileine's collar and smoothed it down.
"Now, let us find your father.  Half the mountain is here today, and
if we do not claim beds for ourselves soon, *la*, we will have to
perch upstairs with the birds."

The mood on Forecastle's streets the next morning was stretched as
taut as a violin string.  Everyone was in a hurry, head down, face
set.  Erileine saw people measure them sidelong as they passed---a
pale red-headed man in an ever-changing coat, a tall black figure in a
dust-colored *deel*, and a round-faced brown girl trailing in their
wake---but no one smiled or said hello.

As they neared the market square, voices shouted in unison.  They
rounded the corner to discover that half the stalls had been cleared
away to make a parade ground.  "Hwah!" Forecastle's gray-haired bosun
and his three mates shouted orders, corrections, encouragement, and
abuse as a dozen squads of spearmen and archers lunged and kneeled,
drew and released.  Beneath their boots lay the outline map of Cherne
that she had heard described, but had never before seen.  White
cobblestones set among the gray showed the continent's coastline; red
ones showed the mountain's path from Mau Ngapcha to Gandan.  A
spatter-edged streak of paint showed the mountain's most recent
course.

The usual pair of guards stood outside the Hardeck's main doors.
Today, though, they wore helmets and gorgets, and gave the approaching
travelers a careful up-and-down as they climbed the stairs.
"Magister," one said to Thomas, nodding respectfully while the other
opened the door.

"Thank you," the magician said politely.  He swept inside like royalty
with Razi and Erileine in his wake.

The captain was in the Grand Hall, his hands clasped behind his back,
a frown furrowing his forehead.  He turned away from the window as
they entered.  "Bookster, magister," he nodded.  "Have you found
anything to brighten my day?"

Razi shook his head.  "*La*, no, not in your library.  But
elsewhere..."  He quickly described the men they had seen.

The captain's expression hardened as the bookster spoke.  "By all the
failed saints," he swore.  "Klaues swore this was nothing to do with
his people."

"*La*, perhaps he is as ignorant of what is being done as we were,"
Razi suggested.  "From what I am told, the tinker's assistant is new
to the mountain."

The captain scowled. "I doubt many people will think that far. Anyway,
it looks like we're headed for Tinhead after all.  Take a look." He
gestured at the window.

Erileine followed the line of the captain's pointing finger.  The
mountains in front of them were ridged and ragged like a crumpled
carpet, snow-white and pine-green.  Without warning, the scene swam
and re-formed.  She yelped and threw up her arms even as the view
steadied again.

"Oh, well done," Thomas murmured appreciatively.  "Well done."  The
panes to the left and right showed what they had a moment before, but
the one in the center had pulled the view closer.  Instead of
mountains fifty gallops away, they were looking at a neat town from
what appeared to be no more than a few hundred strides.  Its
buildings, made of gray brick and roofed with dark slate shingles,
stood in a figure eight around two squares.  Sun glistened on glass in
the buildings' windows---more glass than Erileine had ever seen---but
the only sign of life was a lone jay that fluttered away even as they
watched.

"It's beautiful work," Thomas said, ignoring the view and running a
gentle fingertip across the glass.  "Absolutely beautiful.
Korrandarrenduk?"

The captain shook his head.  "Ip of Seyferte.  About three hundred
years ago.  There used to be another one at Aft Landing, but some
Bantangui pirate smashed it to bits about a hundred years ago."

"May he be reborn to misery a thousand thousand times." Thomas spoke
the curse without rancor.  "Do you mind me asking its price?"

The captain shrugged.  "My name.  And I can't leave the mountain."

"Ah." Thomas nodded sympathetically.  "Ip was never one to use a pin
when a lance would do."

"*La*, captain, can you move the focus?" Razi interrupted.

The captain nodded.  "Yes.  But only to things that you could see that
are in view anyway."

Razi pursed his lips.  "*La*, so, where is the picture of Tinhead? The
one from the book?"

The captain jerked his thumb at the wall.  "I stuck it up there next
to the whales."

Razi blinked.  "*La*, you tore it out of the book?"

"No, of course not.  I used a razor.  Why?"

Razi stared at the captain.  "Perhaps...  perhaps in future a copy
would suffice, yes?" he said stiffly.

The captain and Thomas exchanged amused looks as Razi took the page
down from the wall.  He held it up in front of the window, glancing
back and forth between it and the scene in front of them.

"*La*, so, can you show us what's to the left, please?" he asked.  The
captain passed his hand slowly in front of the window.  The view slid
sideways, making Erileine's stomach lurch.  Pines no different from
Avaunt's, and rocks, and a fence around an empty pasture---

"Stop! There."  Razi pointed.  A tower twenty stories high stood
against the side of the mountain.

"Why in the names of the saints would anyone build something like that
in the middle of nowhere?" the captain demanded testily.

"Because you expect something to come to it?"  Erileine said.  She
blushed under the sudden weight of three pairs of adult eyes.
"Sorry," she muttered.  "I just thought..."

Thomas beamed.  "You *do* pick bright ones, don't you? One day I shall
have to ask you how you find them.  My apprentices have all been a
great disappointment."

"Hold the reins a moment," the captain interrupted.  "It must have
taken years to build that thing! Do you think someone's been planning
this for that long?"

Thomas shrugged.  "Who can say? A closer look might give us some
answers."

The captain frowned.  "I could send one of the condors."

"*La*, but how long would that take?" Razi said.  "Whereas if we left
now, we could be back in time to spoil your dinner."

"We?"  Thomas blinked theatrically.  "As in, you and me?  Razi... I
thought you said you'd see me dead before you'd set foot on the
*Presumption* again."

"That was more of a hope than a requirement," the bookster replied.

"Stow it," the captain ordered sharply.  He frowned at the view in
front of him.  If the top-most branches of the trees hadn't been
swaying gently in the afternoon breeze, Erileine could have believed
it was some strange kind of painting.  "All right.  Do you want a
couple of my men along, just in case?"

"I'm sure we'll be fine," Thomas said politely.  "If we leave now, we
ought to have enough light to find our way back." He gestured toward
the door.  "After you?"

As they turned to leave, Razi pulled a string of coins out of the
sleeve of his *deel*.  "Take these and find us a room," he ordered, as
if Erileine had done it for him a dozen times before.  "Somewhere
close by---*la*, closer than the Green Pig, if you can.  I would
prefer quiet to noisy, and small to large, and a bath above all other
things."

A few minutes later, Erileine stood alone on the Hardeck's steps.  She
hefted the string of coins.  It was more money than she had ever held
in her life.  Somewhere with a hot bath *would* be nice.  Somewhere
with a hot bath and a library would be even nicer.

Erileine didn't think of herself as shy, but he had never had to ask a
stranger for directions before.  She had always been able to follow
her father through the streets and alleys that doubled back on
themselves, met at odd angles, or, in the case of the one she was now
on, dead-ended against the front door of a bootmaker's.

Voices rose and fell inside.  "Hello?" she said uncertainly, pushing
the door open.

The two women sitting behind the long trestle table inside looked up
and said, "Clear day," in unison.  Both had their hair in braids
pulled back and tied with twists of silk.  Planks of dark brown
leather lay in neat stacks behind them, while half-finished boots lay
in pieces or stood upside down on lasts before them.  A samovar as big
as a goat's head took up one entire end of the table.  The sugary
smell coming from it made Erileine's stomach grumble.

Erileine cleared his throat.  "Clear day.  I'm, um, we're visiting.
From Starboard Town."

"With the bosun?" the woman on Erileine's left asked immediately.

The one on the right rolled her eyes.  "Shush, Gisaelle, let the girl
speak."

"Um, sort of.  He went back yesterday. I'm just, I'm supposed to find
somewhere to stay.  Do you know anywhere? Somewhere small and nearby?"

"The Sign of the Three Rabbits," the woman on the right said.  "It's
the bosun's favorite when he's here, isn't that right, Gisaelle? Very
quiet for those who don't want to be disturbed." She elbowed the other
woman in the ribs.

Gisaelle blushed.  "It's a very good inn," she said, a little weakly.

The first woman snorted.  "I'm sure.  Anyway, two up on your left to
the cordwainer's, go down the alley, left again to the stairs by the
flower seller, top of the stairs.  Not far at all, isn't that right,
Gisaelle?"

"Far enough for people who don't want other people sticking their
noses into things that are none of their business," the woman on the
left said sharply.

When they wanted a scare, Avauntois children told each other about a
house in Aft Landing (or maybe Portside, it depended who was telling
the story).  There was nothing behind its back door but empty air, and
when children were nosy, the evil magician (or Hett, or ghost) who
lived there sent them out back to fetch firewood.

Erileine felt like she had just stepped through that door.  She raised
his palms with a hasty, "Thank you, ladies, that's very helpful, much
appreciated," and fled.

A grin split her face as she walked toward the cordwainer's.  She
would *definitely* have to ask the bosun about his boots when he got
home.  Of course, the story would be better if he knew the name of the
shop...

She turned impulsively at the thought.  The small figure two dozen
strides behind her instantly turned around as well.  "Hoy!" Erileine
exclaimed.  "Hoy, you!" It was the ragtag boy who had tried to steal
the bosun's wallet.  "Stop!" But he had already disappeared into a
side alley like a rabbit going down a hole.

Erileine thrust her hand into her pocket and whooshed with relief.
The coins Razi had given her were still there.  Wasn't the boy
supposed to be in a dungeon? She hurried up the street.  As soon as
she found an inn, she would go back to the Hardeck and tell them he
had escaped.

The Sign of the Three Rabbits was as big as the Captain's House in
Starboard Town, and just as well kept.  Knee-high wooden planters
filled with red and yellow azaleas stood guard on either side of its
spotless yellow front door.  More flowers watched primly from matching
planters on the window sills.  Symmetric blue whorls were painted on
either side of the door frame, Bantangui style, representing the ears
that were supposed to listen for malicious gossip about the house's
residents.  The old woman snoring in a wicker rocking chair on the
balcony above the door made the picture complete.

Erileine yanked the braided cord that hung by the door.  A drum
thumped inside, but no one answered.  He pulled the cord again,
harder.

The snoring stopped.  "Who is it?" a voice yawned.

Erileine stepped back from the door and looked up.  The old woman was
rubbing her eyes, her dark brown face silhouetted against the sky.

"Clear day, *sra*," she said politely.  "I'm looking for a room for
the night.  The bootmakers said you might have one?"

The old woman dug the last of her nap out of the corners of her eyes.
"On your own?" she asked doubtfully.

Erileine shook her head.  "No, *sra*.  I'm Bookster Razi's apprentice.
The room's for both of us." She held up her string of coins and
jingled them.

A few minutes later, Erileine had exchanged a half-ring and sixpence
for a pair of wooden tokens that might have looked like rabbits to
whoever had carved them.  The old woman certainly knew Bosun Uyves.
Very popular, the bosun was.  Easy to see why, with shoulders like
his, and that smile, and of course everyone said he was such a good
dancer, not that she had ever had a chance herself, her dancing days
were far behind her, just as Erileine's were still in front of er.
She did dance, didn't she? With anyone in particular yet? No? Oh, that
would come, that would come, not to worry.  Why, she herself had been
fifteen the first time someone had asked her to dance.  A vagabond, he
turned out to be, not like the bosun, but of course she couldn't have
known that at the time.  Now, did she want to leave those bags with
her, or in the room?  Oh, yes, the room had a lock, of course, and not
just for when they were berthed at Normous or Mau Ngapcha, no, sad to
say, the mountain had thieves of its own, indwellers most of them, or
Hett, the saints alone knew why the captain let either onto the
mountain, not that she was questioning his judgment, of course, he was
a fine captain, though his predecessor *had* been much firmer about
such things.  That camp of theirs by the sawdust tips was as good as
being a little town of its own now, wasn't it? And that house on Squid
Street, well, it shouldn't be allowed, not that it was her place to
decide that, of course, the captain knew his business, he was a fine
man, just as Bosun Uyves was a fine, fine man, very popular, and easy
to see why, of course, with shoulders like his, and that smile...

Her words splashed over Erileine like the monsoon rains of Mau
Ngapcha.  She kept smiling and saying, "Yes, *sra*," and "Thank you,"
and turning toward the door, but the torrent of words didn't stop
until she backpedaled onto the street.

And so Erileine found herself alone in the biggest town on Avaunt with
time on her hands and money in her pocket.  Emboldened by her success
in finding the Three Rabbits, she asked a man walking by with a rack
of skewered chickens over his shoulder for directions.  Booksellers'
Cross?  Down that way was fastest.  Erileine ducked to avoid being
clouted by a dead chicken as he turned to describe the route.

Anyone watching would have thought Erileine was ambling without a care
in the world---at least, that's what she hoped.  She peered into shop
windows, stopped to study herself in the half-height mirror chained to
the wall in front of a tailor's, and doubled back on her own trail
half a dozen times.  She never looked directly at the ragged figure
trailing in her wake.  It was just like trying to round up Mamaere
Mayeule's cat: you had to get *it* to chase *you*...

But eventually her shadow disappeared.  Disappointed, she doubled back
once more, but the boy was gone.  She shrugged, trying to be
philosophical.  At least now she could actually go and look at some
books.

His father had first taken him to Booksellers' Cross on his eighth
naming day.  The booksellers had rolled their eyes at one another, all
thinking, "Here's another one," as they remembered themselves at her
age.

Novels, pamphlets, diaries... Poetry, medicine, recipes, magic, and
law... Gandan-o, Ruudian, Uwsian, Bantangui, Praczny, and languages
Erileine didn't yet recognize...  Lost among the petrified learning,
the frozen elsewheres and elsewhens, she took no more notice of time
passing than she did of her own breathing.

She leafed through every Praczny book she found, finally selecting a
tract on the rights of Gifted animals and a collection of romantic
stories full of noble knights who left their loves behind for seven
years while they quested after tin rings that held their parents'
souls, or magicians who were wrongly imprisoned for necromancy, only
to be saved (or doomed) when a king in waiting fell in love with them.
She weighed them in his hands, then put the tract back where she had
found it.  His mother and Queçenne would prefer the stories, she told
herself, not admitting to herself that she'd enjoy them too.

"Three rings," the bookseller said when Erileine asked its price.

Her jaw dropped.  "Three rings!?"

The bookseller shrugged without looking up from the water-stained
collection of fishing poems he was carefully mending.  He was as tall
as Razi, but skinny where Erileine's teacher was merely lean, and had
stupendously bad breath.  "That's cheap.  Possibly the only cheap
things left on the mountain, books.  Beans and wool, they're what's in
fashion these days." He snorted, sawing delicately at the book's
binding with a scaling knife.

Erileine sighed.  A half-ring, and he might have bought it.  But three
rings!

She scowled.  "A half-ring and eightpence."

"No." The bookseller didn't even look up.

"All right, a half and ten," Erileine offered.  "Look, the spine is
almost broken.  I'll have to stitch the pages back together in a year
or two."

The bookseller glanced at the book, then at Erileine.  "Two rings a
half and sixpence, not a fingernail less." He shrugged again.  "I
can't sell it for less than I paid, can I?"

"I suppose not," Erileine said, defeated.  She could probably find
something that se could afford, but after deciding she wanted the
stories, anything else would feel second best.  And anyway, it was
getting late.  She should get back to the Hardeck and wait for Razi.

Two new guards stood at the Hardeck's front doors.  As far as they
were concerned, young Starboard Towners belonged in Starboard Town
while all this fuss was going on.  "But I'm Bookster Razi's
apprentice," Erileine protested.  "I was getting us a room.  At the
Three Rabbits."

One of the guards raised his eyebrows at that.  The other shook his
head.  "Can't go in without an escort."

"But I'm supposed to meet him here!"

The guard shook his head again.  "Not without an escort."

"All right." Erileine thought for a moment.  "Well, if you see the
bookster, can you please tell him we're at the Sign of the Three
Rabbits?"  The guard supposed he could do that, so Erileine thanked
him and headed for Dock Street.

Forecastle's lone air dock was a weatherbeaten pine shelf, ten strides
deep and forty long, whose tree-trunk railing posts doubled as
stanchions. Tiny compared to the four-story monsters at Ruuda-in-Ruuda
or Yadanapore, it was adequate for the clouds, magic carpets, and more
unusual visitors the mountain received between its northern and
southern berths.

A small counterbalanced crane was the dock's only resident when
Erileine reached it.  The shadows were lengthening, and the cold air
felt damp.  She shivered and hunched her shoulders so that she could
bury her chin in the collar of her coat.

The land below was beautiful.  Orange sunset reflected off ponds and
streams nestled in countless little valleys, the snow on the peaks of
the mountains around Avaunt, and the clouds grazing near the horizon.
It could have been the approach to Gandan Berth, except there wasn't a
road or a building in sight.  Traders from all over the Nine Marches
would be on their way to meet Avaunt at that centuries-old rendezvous.
How many of them already knew that the mountain wasn't going to be
there?

There! That dot.  She brought her hand up to shield her eyes.  It had
to be Thomas's flying boat, the *Presumption*.  She was coming in
fast, Erileine realized---very fast.

She waved.  A tiny arm wave back.  She dragged a couple of bumpers
over to the dock's edge, looped their nooses around stayposts, and
kicked them under the railing so that they dangled over the side.

The *Presumption* was only fifty strides away when Erileine realized
that something was sticking out of her hull.  Her belly went cold.  It
was an arrow, but as thick around as her arm.  Splinters starred the
planks around its puncture like a frozen shout of pain.

Thomas steered the *Presumption* in close, yelling, "Clear away!"
Erileine scrambled back.  As the flying boat thudded against the
bumpers, he threw an end of rope at Erileine.  "Tie her fast!" he
ordered.  "Fates and Furies, what a mess!"

"Where's Razi?" Erileine asked as she made a clumsy knot.

Thomas slipped around the mast to the boat's bow and jumped onto the
dock with another length of line in his hand, heedless of the
half-gallop of empty air below him.  "It's not that I think it would
be much of a loss," he said as he tied the boat fast.  "But *she*
would never believe that I didn't have a hand in it.  Here, get that
gangplank over here." He hopped back into the boat.

"But where's Razi?" Erileine repeated.  Panic was like cold soup in
her throat.

Thomas crouched down.  "Come on," he grunted, "Stop messing up my
boat." He straightened, his right arm around Razi's back, his left
holding the bookster's arm across his shoulders.

"*La*, so, put down a rug next time," Razi mumbled.  His *deel* was
slick red with blood.  More was leaking through the fingers he had
pressed against his side.

He and Thomas stumbled down the gangplank like drunkards.  As they
reached the dock, the bookster tripped over his own unsteady feet and
collapsed.

---

"He's half-empty," Nuu Ciy said matter-of-factly, washing her hands in
a basin of soapy water.  "And if it had been a thumb to the left, he'd
be compost.  As it is..."

"As it is?" the captain prompted.

His wife was a head shorter than Erileine, but carried herself as if
she was as big as the mountain.  She dried her hands on a scrap of
cotton and dropped it into a shallow copper bowl whose sides were
sticky with Razi's blood.  She sighed and started untying her apron.
"As it is, he'll live, unless he does it again."

"Thank you, love." The infirmary on the ground floor of the Hardeck
was as big as the Grand Hall.  Two dozen wooden beds lined one wall;
the other was completely taken up with shelves.  Bandages and spools
of strong cotton thread stood next to trays of scalpels and
wicked-looking bone saws.  Night had fallen, so the only light came
from pieces of dayglass set in bamboo sconces above the beds.

Nuu Ciy had stitched Razi's wound closed as carefully as Papaere Vurt
would stitch up a torn boot, and about as gently.  She had muttered
small spells the whole time, pleas for strength and wards against
infection that made her hands glisten faintly.  Erileine wondered what
she was giving up on Razi's behalf: a little more of her sense of
smell, perhaps, or her memory of the bright blue dress she had worn on
her tenth naming day.

Through it all, Thomas sat on the bed next to Razi's, watching Nuu
Ciy's work with professional curiosity.  Erileine had almost (almost)
punched him when he told Erileine that he couldn't help Razi.  "But
he's dying!" she had shouted.

"Yes, so the faster you get help, the better," he repeated for the
third time.

"But why can't *you* fix him!?" she pleaded.

"Because I like being able to open doors for myself," the magician
snapped.  "And having to return to this dreary venue once a year for
the rest of my life would be unspeakably tiresome.  Now, are you going
to do something useful, or shall we sit back and wait for those
imbecile condors?"

Erileine had gone for help.

As Nuu Ciy's assistants scrubbed streaks of blood off her arms, the
captain turned to Thomas.  "So, there was no warning at all?"

Thomas shook his head.  "None.  As I said before---twice, I
believe---we were still a gallop from town. They must have hidden
siege bows in the trees by the road." He yawned suddenly.  "Clever of
them, I must say.  I mean, they can't actually have been *expecting*
us."

The captain's scowl showed what he thought of Tinhead's inhabitants
being clever.  "And there was just the one shot?"

Thomas shrugged.  "There may have been more afterward, but I turned
tail the instant we were hit.  It's rather vexing, you know.  I put a
lot of work into that boat---it will take ages to mend her."

The guard at the door cleared his throat meaningfully.  "What?"  the
captain barked.

"Chief Steward, *sra*.  Wants to know if you'll want dinner brought
down."

"Saints.  No, I'll take it upstairs as usual.  You might as well get
back to your post.  Oh, and Eamile? No telling tales, understood?"

"Yes, *sra*." The guard saluted sharply, right fist to left breast.

The captain sighed again.  A hundred people had seen Razi carried into
the Hardeck, unconscious and dripping blood.  By now, half the town
would be saying that he had been attacked by griffins, gargoyles, or
gaunts, while the other half would be just as sure that he and Thomas
had fought a duel on board the magician's flying boat.  He'd be dead
and risen, or have vanished in a puff of smoke.

"And someone will find a way to blame the Hett," he said sourly.

"*Sra?*" Erileine said uncertainly.

"Nothing," the captain said, clapping her on the shoulder, his eyes on
Razi.

Nuu Ciy unstoppered a small black bottle and painted a few drops of
poppy tar on Razi's lips with the trimmed end of a gull's feather.
"He'll sleep until morning," she announced, re-corking the
sweet-smelling mixture.  "Now, everyone out.  No, you too, young
woman.  One of my nurses will stay with him."

Erileine was out the door and on the Hardeck's steps before she
realized that she had no idea what to do next.  Once again, she was on
her own in the biggest town on the mountain with a string of coins in
her pocket.  This time, though, the sky was dark, and her teacher was
unconscious with twenty-two fresh stitches in his side.  She supposed
she should go back to the Three Rabbits, but the thought of lying
alone in her room was unbearable.  Maybe he should go to Uncle Regi's
instead, if she could figure out how to get there.

"Well, then." Erileine turned as Thomas ambled down the steps.  "Quite
a day, wasn't it?"

"If you say so," Erileine said curtly.

Thomas smiled indulgently.  "Now, now.  There's really no need to
speak that way."

"He could have *died!*" The angry words were out of Erileine's mouth
before she knew he was going to say them.

Thomas nodded.  "Yes, he could have.  He could have died yesterday,
too, or the day before.  Would that have been my fault too?"

For a moment, all Erileine could do was gape like a fish out of water.
"You---you could have saved him if you wanted to! You could have---"
*You could have grabbed his hand,* she'd been about to say.  *All you
had to do was reach out.*

Thomas sighed theatrically.  "It escapes me, truly, why supposedly
educated people believe that magicians can just snap their fingers and
set the world right.  Every spell I might have used would have cost me
far more than I was willing to give up, especially with so much
mundane help just a few steps away.  Rushing around and saving
people---that's not really what magicians do, you know.  That kind of
thing is better left to the booksters of this world."

"Did you tell his last apprentice that too?" Erileine asked bitterly.

Thomas smiled thinly.  "No.  No, what I told *him* was that if I ever
saw him again, I'd put his eyes out with my thumbs." He nodded
farewell politely and, whistling, went on his way.

Erileine's anger dissipated as quickly as it had come, leaving her
cold and tired.  She bought a sausage on a stick and a strip of flat
bread from a stall that stayed open for militiamen on the night watch,
and chewed them slowly as she walked back to the Three Rabbits.

The old woman at the Three Rabbits had already heard about Razi, but
seemed more worried about Erileine.  "I'm fine," she reassured her.
"But I hope my maere and paere hear the story straight.  I mean, if
someone tells them it was me instead of him..."

"Well, there's nothing anyone can do about that tonight, is there?"
the old woman said soothingly.  "Now, are you sure you aren't hungry?
There's plenty of beans left in the pot."

"I'm fine, thank you.  I think I'll just go to bed."

"All right.  Oh, but wait.  I almost forgot.  Your little friend left
this for you.  He said you dropped it in the market." The old woman
took a book from the mantelpiece and handed it to her.

Erileine blinked.  It was the collection of stories she had looked at
that afternoon.  "Thank you," she said automatically.  "Was it---who
dropped it off?"

The old woman raised an eyebrow.  "You don't know?"

Erileine shrugged, feeling embarrassed.  "I can guess," she lied,
"But, you know, I'd hate to get it wrong."

The old woman's smile turned up at the corners.  "Starboard Town must
be quite the place on holidays."

Erileine blinked.  "Excuse me?"

"Well, if everyone is as popular as you and the bosun...  I'd say he
was twelve or thirteen.  Could use some new clothes and a bath, but he
had very nice eyes."

Blushing, Erileine thanked her again and climbed the stairs to her
room.  The only light came from a sliver of dayglass beside the
window.  It was cheap stuff, so orange that it was almost red, and
didn't cast nearly enough to read by, but she sat on his bed with the
book open in her lap anyway.  It had to have been the thief.  But why
would he give her a book? Unless he planned to tell the militia that
she had stolen it.  No, that didn't make any sense.  The old woman
would tell them where it had come from.

She riffled its pages, then turned it upside down and shook it.
Nothing.  Invisible ink? Magic writing that would only show up when
the moon was full, or if the reader whistled the right song?

Defeated, she wrapped the book in her spare shirt and slipped it into
her satchel, then stripped down to her underclothes and slid her
skinny legs under the the quilt.  She would take the book back
tomorrow, right after she checked on Razi.  She closed her eyes and
tried not to think of the bookster lying on the dock, bleeding.  She
had just stood there.  He had needed her help, and she had just
*stood* there.

Sleep was a long time coming.

---

The old woman shook Erileine awake.  "What? What?" Erileine demanded
muzzily.  The little piece of dayglass had long since gone dull, but
the old woman had a small brass lantern.  Lighting her face from
below, it made her look like a ghost out of a Bantangui puppet play.
"I think we're berthing!"  she said fearfully.  "Can't you hear it?"

"What?" The words made no sense to Erileine.  How could they be
berthing?  But suddenly the crackling sound she could hear wasn't a
fire in the hearth downstairs but a forest being crushed to kindling
by the mountain's underside.  A faint shudder ran through the house.
A moment later, thunder rumbled faintly in the distance.  Erileine
swallowed.  Had they just knocked the peak off one of the mountains
below?

She flung off her quilt and reached for her clothes.  "It woke me up,"
the old woman said, hugging herself inside the oversized ankle-length
coat that she was wearing over her thick white nightdress.  "I went
downstairs to see if it was someone trying to jemmy the door, but
there was no one there, and then everything started shaking.  What's
happening?"

*Why are you asking me?* Erileine thought resentfully, even though she
knew it was because she had no one else to ask.  "I don't know," she
said.  He pulled her right foot out of her left boot and took a deep
breath.  "Do you have someone you can be with?  Just in case?"

"There's my son-by-marriage," she said uncertainly.  "He's remarried
now, but he's just two streets away.  But he hates fuss---I don't want
to be a fuss."

Erileine almost laughed.  She was pretty sure this wouldn't be counted
as fussing.  "I'm sure he won't mind," she said, knotting her laces
and grabbing her satchel.  "But I have to get to the Hardeck."

She ran through the streets of Forecastle like a rabbit with a lynx on
its tail.  The streets seemed even more tangled in the dark.  Twice
she thought she had lost her way, but each time she came around a
corner and found herself exactly where she should have been.

Around her, guards with militia helmets in one hand and spears or bows
in the other hurried to their rallying stations.  People with coats or
blankets thrown over their nightclothes stood in doorways or looked
out of thrown-open shutters, yelling questions at each other, at
Erileine, at the mountain itself.

One last corner, and she was in the market square.  It was chaos.
Someone yelled, "Caeline!  Caeline!" over and over, looking for their
squad or perhaps a lost cat.  "Watch where you swing that!" a man in
striped summer trousers and heavy boots snarled as a clumsy
militiaman's spear nearly took his ear off.

"If you've got your gear, find the rest of your squad and form up!" a
bosun's mate bellowed.  "If you don't, then get it!  Hey, where do you
think you're going?"

"I'm the bookster's apprentice," Erileine panted.  "He's in the
infirmary.  I'm supposed to be with him." She started up the steps.

The bosun's mate blocked her.  "Get off with you."

A guardsman coming up the stairs behind Erileine caught her.  "Go easy
there," he cautioned the shover.  "We're not at war yet." He looked at
Erileine.  "I know you.  You were with what's his name, the fellow on
the boat."

Erileine nodded vigorously.  "In the infirmary.  I'm supposed to be
with him now."

The guardsman let go of her arm.  "Well then, get in there." He pushed
Erileine up the stairs, past the glowering mate.

Erileine raced to the infirmary, dodging clerks, mates, and household
staff as they all tried to organize one another.  She stopped at the
infirmary door to catch her breath, then pushed it open as gently as
she could.  "Bookster?" she said softly.

Razi lay motionless in bed, looking exactly as he had when Erileine
last saw him.  For a moment Erileine thought he was dead, that the
spells the captain's wife had used hadn't been enough, but then Razi's
fingers twitched.

"Bookster!" she whispered loudly.  "Are you awake?"

The bookster's eyes fluttered.  "Eimin?"

"Bookster?"

"*La*, Erileine..." Razi struggled to sit up, then let his head fall
back on his pillow.  "When is?"

"It's morning.  Almost, anyway.  You're in the infirmary, in the
Hardeck.  Bookster, we're berthing!"

The bookster closed his eyes again.  "And the sea shall give me over
to the land, constant and weighty," he whispered.

"Bookster, are you all right?" Erileine sat on the edge of her
teacher's sick bed, swallowing back the panic rising in her throat.
She hadn't thought any further than finding Razi.  He *had* to know
what to do.

The dark man chuckled weakly.  "*La*, I do not think that is the
phrase I would use.  Have you water?"

There was, a pitcher on the table where Nuu Ciy's bowl had been.
Erileine poured some into a heavy brown pottery mug and held it up
gingerly.

Razi sipped and made a face. "There's poppy in this."

Erileine took it from him uncertainly.  "The captain's wife gave you
some last night.  Do you remember what happened?"

Razi sighed raggedly.  "Someone shot us.  Me.  From the trees." He
slid one hand down to his side under the quilt and winced.  "*La*...
She will be disappointed in me, you know.  I told her, yes, I promise,
I can do a little traveling without gathering any new scars." He tried
to chuckle.

The room trembled slightly.  Erileine clutched the bedframe wide-eyed.
"What was that?" Razi said, some of his usual sharpness in his voice.

"I think it was another mountaintop."

"Another...? *Ye mashe aue*, we're berthing?" At Erileine's nod the
bookster tried once more to sit up.  Erileine rushed forward to help
him, but the bookster fell back again before he could.

"Go," Razi said.  "*La*, go, the magic window.  Find news.  I will
dress."

Erileine took the stairs to the Grand Hall three at a time.  They
shuddered beneath her.  A painting fell from the wall, missing her by
a handspan.  She tripped at the top, banging her knee painfully
against the floor, but hobbled on.

The Grand Hall was as full as the market square.  He squeezed between
two guards, ducked under a clerk's elbow, and found herself just
inches from the magic window.

"Brace yourselves," the captain barked.  The room shook as Avaunt
clipped another peak.  For a moment Erileine thought the red thread
running through the trees below them was lava, but it was just the
rising sun reflecting off a stream.

The scene below was like something out of the Pilots' war.  This
wasn't Gandan Berth or the jungle at Mau Ngapcha.  Avaunt hadn't
trimmed these trees every sixteen months for centuries.  These were
full grown, tall and proud, but still they bent under the force of the
mountain's bow wave just before being snapped in half.

A flock of frightened ducks burst upward from a pond as its surface
trembled.  The winged pigs that had been rooting in the muck at the
pond's edge took flight a moment later, and then the pond was gone.
Deer and gaur fled in panic side by side with chameleon bears, the
Gifted among them shouting panicked orders.  Nests and burrows were
crushed as Avaunt ground the earth beneath it.

Suddenly there was silence, as the mountain cleared a ridge and the
land momentarily dropped away beneath them.  "Look!" half a dozen
voices shouted needlessly.  There, nestled in a bowl-shaped valley,
lay Tinhead, its neat streets and tidy houses peaceful in the
dawnlight.

The captain swept his hand across the window.  The scene shimmered and
re-formed.  They were close enough now that they almost didn't need
magic to see, Erileine thought dazedly.  Another few moment and they
could have seen the soldiers with their own eyes.

And soldiers they clearly were, on the road that wound up the steep
hills standing guard behind the town, real soldiers with polished
steel helmets on their heads, heavy packs on their backs, and swords
at their sides.  Some had their shoulders against the rear ends of
carts, while others bawled silently at heavy-laden mules, but most
just marched.

The captain passed his hand over the window again.  There were more
carts further up the mountain, heavier ones, with four wheels instead
of two, piled high with furniture, chickens in coops, children, a very
pregnant woman, an elderly couple dressed in the same gray wool as
everyone else.  As the image swept by, Erileine saw one boy, as
pale-skinned as a Ruudian, jump up and point toward town.  The old man
sitting beside him on the cart's plank seat turned to look back at the
houses the mountain was about to crush.  *I hope you're as frightened
as we are,* Erileine thought grimly.

"Come on, where is it?" the captain growled.  Another pass, another
scene.  The gray tower they had seen the day before was now an
enormous prow of stone, twenty stories high.  The road from town
zigzagged beside it.  Three arched openings, each two stories tall and
broad enough to swallow a cart, broke its front face.  Heavy timbers
lay stacked in piles by each one.

The room rumbled again.  This time, the rumbling didn't stop.  The
mountain wasn't just clipping the tops of the hills any longer.  It
was down, grinding implacably toward Tinhead.

Without warning a house collapsed.  One wall of another gave way as
the town's two cobblestoned squares rippled like blankets being
shaken.

"Bosun!" the captain barked.  "Bosun!  Get the birds out!  And send
Jack, too.  Tell them we've berthed at Tinhead, and need help.  Tell
them!"

"Yes *sra*!" the bosun snapped, saluting.  "Tell who, *sra*?"

"Everyone! Saints in dark places, it doesn't matter, just *send
them!*"

The bosun saluted, staggering and nearly falling as the floor shook
beneath him.  All around Erileine, people yelled at each other to stop
yelling, to make way, to stand back from the window in case it
shattered, it would be a hailstorm of knives if it did, saints, why
was this happening? Why was this happening?

Sunlight glinted off the helmets of the soldiers waiting for them.
The tower wouldn't reach as high as Forecastle, Erileine realized.
Not even close.  When the mountain berthed, the openings would be face
to face with sheer cliffs.  Unless---

She squirmed around a shaven-headed clerk and tugged on the captain's
sleeve.  "*Sra*! *Sra*!" she blurted.  "The tunnels!"

"What?" The captain looked down at her.  "What are you doing here?
Where's the bookster?"

"The tunnels!" Erileine shouted.  "That's what the tower is for.
They're going to go into the tunnels!"

The captain's gaze snapped back to the window.  "Bosun!" he bellowed.
"Where is the damned weeping bosun?" He grabbed a clerk's arm.  "Go
and find him!"

Erileine turned back to the window, clutching her satchel to her
chest.  Ten heartbeats, five...  The town disappeared below the
window's lower edge.  Erileine imagined he felt an especially hard
bump as Avaunt ground Tinhead into gravel.

Suddenly the mountain slowed.  Erileine was thrown forward against the
window, along with everyone else in the room.  Miraculously, it held.
She stood up, her face pressed against the glass.  The mountain had
stopped.  They had berthed.

---

Chaos ruled Forecastle.  Children and adults alike cried out in
terror.  Bosun's mates bawled for order as the militiamen in the
market square struggled back to their feet, tripping over one
another's spears.  Fallen lamps scattered shards of broken dayglass
like burning leaves.  People were thrown down stairs, losing teeth and
breaking arms.  Lintels cracked, roofs fell in, and a whole row of
warehouses on Butterjuggle Square collapsed.  Miraculously, both the
single old man asleep on guard and the young lovers who had snuck in
for some privacy walked away with nothing worse than scratches.

Rumors scampered around like rabbits.  The mountain had crushed an
entire town when it berthed.  Hundreds were dead, or none, or a
thousand vengeful Hett ghosts had come to eat everyone's souls.  The
magician Thomas had stolen the spell that kept the mountain flying,
and the captain wanted his head.

Adminst the confusion, Erileine jostled her way downstairs and ran
pell-mell back to the infirmary.  The bookster's face was drawn, but
he was sitting up.  He smiled when he saw his apprentice.  "*La*, once
again, history is being made around me, and all I want is a few quiet
moments with a night jar.  Please, help me up."

Erileine hurried to the bed.  Razi took hold of his apprentice's
shoulder and pulled himself to his feet.

"Are you sure you should be getting up?" Erileine asked anxiously.

The bookster pressed his free hand against his side.  "*La*, no, I am
most sure that I should not be.  But I will be all right unless the
good doctress finds out.  Now, help me upstairs"

They didn't even make it to the door before Nuu Ciy swept in like a
tiny, determined storm.  "Back to bed," she ordered sharply as she
threw open a cupboard and began piling bandages and bamboo splints in
the arms of her apprentices.

Razi straightened up.  "*La*, and miss the excitement?"

Nuu Ciy barely glanced at him, banging the cupboard door shut and
pulling open a drawer.  "All of them," she told her apprentices
brusquely, pointing at the knives and tongs that lay in polished
mahogany cases.  She turned back to the bookster.  "Now.  Or on my
blood, I'll give you a dose of poppy syrup that will keep you asleep
until the world melts away."

Razi nodded meekly in defeat.  "Come," he said to Erileine, shuffling
his feet as he turned around.  "Back to prison."

Erileine had to help Razi sit on the edge of the bed, then help him
again to lie flat.  "*La*, I am fine," the bookster winced.

"You don't *look* fine," Erileine said, secretly glad that the
captain's wife had caught them.  "Do you want some water?"

"Please.  *La*, wait." Razi shook his head.  "Not from the jug.  I
need my head clear.  Get it from over there.  You found us rooms?
Yes?  Well done.  Now, *la*, I must ask a small favor of you, and then
also a large one."

Erileine nodded, wiping the mug beside the bookster's bed with her
shirttail and re-filling it from the urn by the door.  "What do you
want?"

Razi swallowed a sip of water and coughed weakly.  "Goodness, that
hurts."  He rested the mug on his chest.  "There is a black leather
case with silver stitching in my pack, and a pair of candles.  And a
silver knife with a crystal handle.  Oh, and underclothes.  I really
should put on some clean underclothes."

Erileine hesitated.  "Are those your...your meditation candles?"

"You mean, am I going to cast a spell?" Razi shook his head.  "*La*, I
am afraid not.  Getting my things is just the small favor.  Using them
for me is the large one."

Erileine swallowed dryly.  "I'm not a magician."

Razi smiled weakly.  "Neither am I.  The spell is in the candles, and
in the picture that is in the case.  Lady Kembe paid their price when
she made them---you don't have to worry about your teeth falling out,
or having to stand on your head when you make water."

"I wasn't," Erileine lied.  "I just..." She shrugged.

Razi's eyes were tired but steady.  "She needs to know, Erileine.  She
can't help us if she doesn't know what has happened."

Erileine swallowed and nodded.  She had dreamed about being a
magician.  There wasn't a child in Cherne who hadn't.  When she was
little, she had imagined turning herself into a tiger or an elephant.
Later, she had daydreamed about having a giant's strength so that she
could settle the score with Fraederiq.  "What do I have to do?"  she
asked.

"Just light the candles and say some words.  That's all.  *La*, truly,
that's all." Razi closed his eyes.  Suddenly, surprisingly, he
chuckled.  "It's a pity I don't have anything to read.  This would be
a wonderful time to catch up."

Erileine slid his satchel off his shoulder, undid the drawstring, and
pulled out the collection of Praczny tales.  "How about this?" she
asked.

Razi took it from her flipped through the pages.  His eyebrows went
up.  "'Oh, Sieur Artan, the sun will burn out before I give my heart
to any man but you.'  Erileine, I would never have guessed your tastes
were so...purple."

Erileine felt her ears burning.  "It's for my maere and sister," she
mumbled.  "I thought I could read it to them.  For practice."

"*La*, yes, well..." Razi turned another page.  His eyebrows went up
even higher.  "You may want to read it through yourself before you do
so for them.  Some of the vocabulary is rather...advanced."

Erileine slipped out of the infirmary and hurried along the corridor.
None of the clerks and guards he passed took any notice of him.
Outside, half of the militia in the market square had managed to form
up, spearmen and archers side by side.  The rest were still milling
around, shouting for their companions or standing on tiptoe, waving to
be seen.  *They don't even have proper uniforms*, Erileine thought.
The spearmen wore vests and helmets of bootsole leather.  The soldiers
in Tinhead had all been in armor.

She shook his head.  Unshuttering the tiny hand lantern she'd taken
from the infirmary cupboard, she hurried back to the Sign of the Three
Rabbits.

It was locked.  Erileine thumped the inn's door drum over and over
again, but the old woman didn't appear.  She stepped back and looked
up at the little balcony.  If she could get up there, and if that door
wasn't locked...  But how?

"She went to stay with her son-by-marriage." Erileine whirled around
at the voice behind him.  The thief boy was standing a few strides
away in the mouth of the narrow alley that ran between the inn and the
house beside it.

"What are you doing here?" Erileine demanded.

The boy scowled.  "That's none of your business.  Now, do you want to
get in or not?"

Erileine opened her mouth to say 'no', and instead said, "Yes.  It's
really important.  The bookster needs his things."

The boy nodded.  "All right, I'll get them for you."

"Oh no you won't.  He told *me* to get them."

The boy crossed her arms.  "Fine.  Go ahead."

Erileine glowered at him.  "Look, just tell me where her
son-by-marriage lives, and I'll go get a key."

"Uh uh." He shook his head.

"I don't have time for this," Erileine muttered.  Without thinking,
she took a step toward the boy.  Instantly, he darted into the alley.

"Wait!" she shouted.  "Wait! Come back!" She ran to the alley, but
the thief had vanished.

"Great," she muttered.  She was right back where she had started.  If
she put one of the big planters beside the front door on top of the
other and stood on that...  She still wouldn't be able to reach the
balcony.  And anyway, how was she going to move the planter? It was
half as big as she was.  *Why can't people leave ladders lying around
like they do in stories?* she thought bitterly.

The balcony door opened above him.  The thief stepped out with Razi's
bag in his arms.  "Can you catch?" he asked.

* * *

The guards at the Hardeck's doors waved Erileine through.  Inside, the
confusion had ripened into a more purposeful kind of madness.
What-ifs had been replaced by orders given, clarified, countermanded,
and repeated.

The infirmary was as busy as a tavern on Departure Eve.  A pair of
nurses held a screaming clerk down while Nuu Ciy tried to get the
upper and lower halves of his shin to line up.  A woman with iron-gray
hair waited stoically on the next bed, the cloth she held over one eye
red and getting redder.

Amazingly, Razi was asleep, the book of Praczny stories open on his
chest.  Erileine set her teacher's bag on the floor and sat down
gingerly at the foot of the bed.  Razi's eyes opened.

"*La*, there you are." Razi yawned.  "Did you have any trouble?"

"Not really," Erileine said.  This didn't seem the right time to
explain how she had gotten the bag.  She had checked it, though, to
make sure everything was there.  When the boy protested, Erileine
said, "You told me yourself that you're a thief, remember?"

He had walked with her back to the Hardeck.  The closer they got to
the market square, the edgier he became, until he slipped away between
one step and the next.

Stiff and slow, Razi sat up, then stood.  "Quick," he whispered
loudly, using the bedpost to steady himself, "You distract the guards.
I'll make a shovel out of a feather and an eggshell, and we'll tunnel
our way to freedom."

"What?" Erileine blinked.  Had her teacher taken too much poppy tar?

Razi shook his head.  "*La*, never mind.  Let us escape while the
estimable doctress's attention is elsewhere, yes?"

In the confusion, 'escape' turned out to be no harder than walking out
the door.  The bookster picked up a dayglass lantern that someone had
left by the door, nodded regally at the guard hovering nearby, and
said, "Come along, then," over his shoulder to Erileine.  Just like
that, they were out in the corridor.

They found shelter in a narrow cubbyhole of an office.  The bookster
lowered himself creakily onto the stool behind the room's battered old
writing stand.

"Tie it closed," he ordered.  Piaere fastened the door shut as Razi
opened his bag and took out a cylinder of black leather as long and as
thick as his forearm.  Silver stitching decorated both of its ends and
the seam on its side.  A wooden box came next, and then the knife.
Its short silver blade had a single edge.  Its handle was a piece of
crystal, worn smooth like a pebble in a mountain stream.

Erileine licked her lips.  All the scene needed was a skull with
glowing eyes, a black rat in a wicker cage, and a Gifted troll named
Ygor rubbing his hands together malevolently, and it could have been
put on stage.  "So, what do I do?"

The first step was to take a sketch of Lady Kembe out of the tube and
pin it to the wall.  The woman it showed was as bald as Razi,
round-faced and full-lipped, with shoulders like a longshoreman's and
a pair of fiery wings tattooed on her neck.  She was sitting at a
plain wooden desk; a neat row of books stood watch on a shelf behind
her head, and an elaborate curlicue grill covered the window next to
it.

"That is the writing room in her house in Ossisswe," Razi said,
shaking two brass tacks out of the case and passing them to Erileine.
"The spell only work if she is there.  Luckily, *la*, she usually is."

Next, the candle.  There were two in the box, one half the length of
the other.  Erileine set the shorter one on the floor in front of the
picture.  "Do you want me to find some matches?"

Razi shook his head.  "There's no need.  If she hears us, she will
light it herself.  Now, take the knife.  You need to put three drops
of blood on the wick of the candle."

Like most doors in the Hardeck, the one behind Erileine was padded
with a thick piece of felt.  It muffled the voices, footsteps, and
confusion outside, making the office so quiet that Erileine could hear
herself breathe.

"It only has to be a scratch," Razi said gently.  "You've done worse
falling out of trees."

"I know," Erileine said.  The knife was very sharp.  She would barely
feel it.  It was the idea...  She took a deep breath and pressed the
edge against her forearm, then slumped.  "I don't think I can.  I'm
sorry."

"*La*, it's all right." Razi raised his palms to his apprentice.
"Just put it down.  She probably isn't even there right now."

Erileine nodded jerkily, then surprised herself and the bookster both
by drawing the knife sharply across her forearm.  She gasped as dark
blood welled up, even though she barely felt the cut.

"What should I do with the knife?" she asked, staring a little
lightheadedly at the lengthening red streak on her arm.

"Dip the tip in the blood," Razi commanded.  "Now touch it to the
wick.  Good.  Again.  No, dip it, then touch the wick again---it has
to be three separate drops.  That's right. Now, put the knife down on
the table.  If you look in my bag, you should find a roll of bandage."

Just as Erileine handed the roll of white cotton to Razi, a tiny flame
appeared on the candle wick, and a presence enter the room.  There was
no other way to describe it: Erileine *knew* another person was there.

She she looked over her shoulder at Lady Kembe's picture, the most
powerful magician in Cherne looked back at her quizzically.  "Who are
you?" she asked.  Her lips didn't move---the portrait hadn't come
alive as they sometimes did in stories---but Erileine heard her as
clearly as if she were standing a stride away.

She swallowed dryly.  "I'm Erileine, *sra*.  Erileine Saedie é Laeuc,
of Starboard Town, on Avaunt.  I'm Bookster Razi's apprentice."

Somehow, the portrait frowned without any part of it moving.  "Where
is he? Why not does he speak with myself himself?"  The candle flame
flickered in time with her words.

"He's here, *sra*." Erileine gestured, not knowing whether she could
see or not.  "He was bowshot.  Yesterday.  In Thomas's boat.  We
berthed at Tinhead an hour ago.  There were soldiers waiting for us.
I think they're going into the tunnels, but I don't know for sure."

"Hold, hold," Lady Kembe said.  "Begin you from the beginning.  My
Razi has been shot?"

The story of the day's events tumbled out in pieces.  The more
Erileine talked, the more clearly she saw Lady Kembe.  She was older
than Erileine had first thought, but gave the impression of great
strength.  Her *deel* was white instead of brown, and she had heavy
rings on all of her fingers.

By the time Erileine finished, those fingers were drumming on her
desk.  "You are certain they were truly men?" she demanded.  "Those
the soldiers whom you saw?"

"Yes, *sra*." The scent of the candle was making Erileine dizzy.

Lady Kembe frowned.  "This disquiets me.  Tell my Razi I will make
such inquiries as I may.  Tell him also that such voices as with whom
I would usually speak have fallen into quiet.  I will ask others, but
that will take some time and doing.  And should Thomas attempt any
more than to watch, my Razi is to let me know *immediately*.  That
braggart boy will peril us all if he is not soon kenneled." It didn't
sound like she would particularly mind being the one to kennel him.

"Yes, *sra*, I'll tell him." The room was swimming.  Erileine's head
snapped back.  How could she fall asleep at a time like this? "'S there
an'thing else?"

Lady Kembe's expression softened slightly.  "No.  Tell my Razi that I
shall do my usual to mend him with such as he left here.  He is not to
allow himself more injury in that time, or I shall be very cross
indeed.  Now, darken the candle, and rest.  You have done your name
credit."

"Yes, *sra*," Erileine said faintly.  She almost toppled onto the
candle as she bent over to blow it out.

Lady Kembe's presence vanished.  Erileine's knees gave way.  Her
tongue felt like a slab of raw goat, and tasted almost as rank.  "Sit,
*la*, just sit," Razi told her.  "It will pass."

Erileine slid down to the floor.  The rich, sweet smell of the candle
was too much.  It was like her seventh naming day, when she snuck
downstairs and ate both of the blackberry pies her mother had baked
for her, then threw up in the field behind Mamaere Mayeule's.  The
whole room was going cross-eyed...

"Erileine.  Erileine!" Her eyes snapped open.  Razi held out a small
red bottle.  "Here, this may help.  That's it.  That's it.  No, not
all at once, just a sip, then some more.  *La*, and I will open the
window."

Erileine did as he was told.  The lemon-mint tang of whatever was in
the bottle helped.  So did the cold night air.  She filled her lungs
again and again.  Her stomach was still queasy, and arms and legs felt
like they were made of wet rags, but at least she wasn't going to
throw up.

"Better?" Razi asked.  Erileine nodded.  "*La*, it is quite something,
isn't it? The first time Lady Kembe talked to me that way, my
kidnappers had to tie me onto my camel to stop me falling off
afterward."

"Too bad we don't have any camels," Erileine said.

"*La*, believe me, you are better off without them.  Now, give me your
arm, and tell me what she said."

Razi bandaged Erilein's cut as she recounted Lady Kembe's side of the
conversation.  He nodded when Erileine repeated Lady Kembe's comment
about the 'usual voices' having gone quiet.  "*La*, she thought that
might happen.  The gossipy little spirits who bring her news are
frightened, though they know not of what."

Erileine pulled her sleeve back down.  "Does she know what's going
on?"

"No.  She would tell us if she did.  She is not the kind to send
anyone into battle blindfolded.  *La*, don't look so worried, it is
just a figure of speech.  Now, let us see if sneaking back into bed is
as easy as sneaking out.  You need to sleep---we both of us do."

"Sure." Erileine didn't need convincing.  Her eyelids were so heavy...
"Wha' did she mean about mending you?"

Razi shrugged, seeming almost embarrassed.  "*La*, she will work a
spell to help me heal, is all."

"All the way from there? Wow."

"*La*, well, I left some things behind to make it easier.  Don't worry
about that---you should sleep."

Erileine nodded, looking again at the sketch on the wall.  It was just
ink on linen once more.  "Should I put it away?"

Razi shook his head.  "*La*, no, I will do it.  Though I'm sure we
will need it again soon."

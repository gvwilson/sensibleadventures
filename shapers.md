*Shapers and Bots* is a role-playing game for children age 8 and older.
It is inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
countless stories of talking animals,
and my daughter.
Each game has one or more *players* and one *Director*.
Each player takes on the role of one character,
while the Director plays the part of all the non-player characters.
(The Director is often an adult or the person who created the adventure.)

> Note:
> these rules are derived from Atomic Sock Monkey's PDQ rules.

## Background

Centuries ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals to create dozens of thinking species,
then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels:
half-human creatures with strange powers,
thinking machines that are now their own masters,
and dark shadows that now threaten both.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you can play the part of a young animal adventurer or a newly-conscious bot
trying to find its place in the world.
You can be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and can travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds.

## Game Mechanics

Every character in *Shapers and Bots* is described by a handful of *traits*.
Everything a character might want to do,
like climb a wall,
has a *difficulty*.
Together,
the two determine the odds of the character doing what they want to do.

Every one of a character's traits has a *rating*
with a name and an associated *modifier*:

| Trait Rating | Modifier |
| ------------ | -------: |
| Very Low     | -4       |
| Low          | -2       |
| Average      | 0        |
| High         | +2       |
| Very High    | +4       |
| Extreme      | +6       |

Similarly,
every difficulty has a level and a *target*:

| Task Difficulty | Target |
| --------------- | -----: |
| Trivial         | 3      |
| Easy            | 5      |
| Average         | 7      |
| Difficult       | 9      |
| Hard            | 11     |
| Challenging     | 13     |
| Impossible      | 15     |

When a character wants to do something,
she rolls two six-sided dice (abbreviated "2D")
and adds the modifier for her trait.
If the total is equal to or greater than the target for the task,
she succeeds;
if it is less,
she fails.

Here are a couple of examples:

1. Shau Sheu has a High rating for Climbing, and wants to climb an Average wall.
   She rolls two dice and gets a 3 and a 4.
   Adding them together, and adding another 2 for her Good rating,
   gives a total of 9.
   This is greater than the 7 needed to do an Average task,
   so she succeeds.

2. Shau Sheu now needs to climb a slippery icefall.
   The task is challenging,
   so she needs to get 13 or better to do it.
   She rolls 2 and 6, adds 2 for her Good rating:
   nope.
   The total is only 10,
   so she slips and falls.

## Characters

Every character has an Average rating for these four traits unless otherwise noted:

- **Size**: how large the character is.
  In exceptional cases,
  a character may have separate **Height** and **Weight** traits
  instead of a single Size trait.

- **Fitness**: how strong and coordinated the character is,
  i.e.,
  how athletic they are.

- **Dexterity**: how good the character is at delicate manipulations
  like picking a lock or playing a musical instrument.

- **IQ**: how good the character is at book learning and puzzle solving.
  Note that a character with a low IQ is not necessarily stupid.

Every character also has ratings for **Sight**, **Hearing**, and **Smell**.
These are all Average too unless otherwise noted.

> Note: Smell includes the sense of taste.

Non-player characters (NPCs) may have two extra traits:

- **Courage**: how brave the character is.

- **Honesty**: how likely the character is to tell the truth.

Player characters (PCs) don't have scores for these
because being brave and telling the truth (or not) are part of the game.
NPCs only need to be given scores for these traits when it's important.

## Species

Each species of animal character has different "normal" ratings for traits:

| Species   | Size      | Fitness   | Dexterity | Sight     | Hearing | Smell | Special            |
| --------- | --------: | --------: | --------: | --------: | ------: | ----: | ------------------ |
| bear      | High      | High      | Low       | Low       |         | High  |                    |
| bison     | High      |           | Very Low  | Low       |         |       | horns              |
| eagle     | Low       | Very High |           | Very High | High    | Low   | flying             |
| elephant  | Very High |           |           |           |         |       | prehensile trunk   |
| fox       | Low       |           | High      |           |         | High  | carnivore          |
| goat      |           |           |           |           |         |       | horns              |
| kangaroo  |           | High      |           |           |         |       | leaping            |
| lion      |           | High      |           |           | High    | High  | carnivore          |
| monkey    | Low       |           | Very High | High      |         |       | prehensile tail    |
| rabbit    | Very Low  |           |           |           | High    | High  | may go berserk     |
| raccoon   | Low       |           | Very High | High      |         |       |                    |
| rhino     | High      |           | Very Low  | Low       |         | High  |                    |
| tiger     |           | High      |           |           | High    | High  | carnivore          |
| turtle    | Low       | Low       | High      | Very Low  |         |       |                    |
| wolf      |           | High      |           |           | High    | High  | carnivore          |
| zebra     |           |           |           |           |         |       |                    |

*Example:
Larrapin is a very bright 15-year-old rabbit.*

| Trait     | Rating   |
| --------- | -------- |
| Size      | Very Low |
| Fitness   | Average  |
| Dexterity | Average  |
| IQ        | High     |
| Sight     | Average  |
| Hearing   | High     |
| Smell     | High     |

Note that her IQ is High rather than Average:
Larrapin loves to do puzzles and word games.

## Shaping

A small number of animal characters have psychic powers
that let them control the world with their mind.
This is called *shaping*,
and is almost always attuned to one aspect of reality.
Those who have one of these abilities typically start with a rating of Very Low,
which slowly improves with practice and training.
The six most common kinds of shaping are:

-  **Earth**: dirt and stone. Very experienced earth shapers can also shape metal.

-  **Air**: wind and sound.

-  **Light**: create (silent) illusions and make shadows.

-  **Water**: in its liquid form. Very experienced shapers can also shape ice.
   Water-shaping an animal is a very serious crime.

-  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.

-  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.
   (Nobody can stop or reverse time, or see the future.)

It is *extremely* rare for someone to be able to do more than one kind of shaping.

*Example:
Larrapin is a water shaper.
Before her grandfather passed away,
he taught her what little he knew,
so her score is now Low instead of Very Low.*

## Skills

Every character has skills that they're particularly good at.
Some common skills are listed below
along with the trait or traits they are based on.
If a person doesn't have any special training,
their ability in that skill is equal to their level in that trait
(or the lower of their traits' levels if several are listed).
If the base trait is "--" it means that characters don't have any ability at all by default.

Characters may also have knowledge of history, a language, mathematics, science,
or some other specialized field.
A character's knowledge of any field is initially zero,
and must all be learned.

The Director may allow players to choose skills for their characters
that are not on this list.

*Example:
Larrapin doesn't have any bonuses for Acting and Disguise,
which means her automatic rating is High (equal to her IQ).
Having grown up in the mountains,
though,
she has learned how to ski very well,
so her rating is also High.*

*Example:
Suppose Larrapin is trying to escape a band of angry (and hungry) wolves.
The Director decides that ski-jumping over a ravine has a difficulty of Challenging (13).
Larrapin rolls two dice, gets a total of 5, adds 2 for her High ability,
and tumbles into the ravine!*

## Conflict

Sometimes adventurers are attacked and have to fight their way out of trouble.
Other times,
they have to talk their way past a suspicious guard.
Situations like this are called *conflicts*,
and instead of beating a fixed difficulty,
the player has to get a higher score than their opponent.

*Example:
Larrapin doesn't have any particular training in hand-to-hand fighting,
so her rating is Average.
She has just been tackled by an angry zebra whose rating is High.
Larrapin rolls two dice and gets a total of 8 (with no bonuses).
The zebra rolls two dice and gets 7,
but adds a bonus of 2 for a total of 9.
Larrapin goes down!*

## Bots

The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning floors to mining the ocean floor.
Since the Makers disappeared,
the bots have repaired themselves however they can to keep themselves going,
and made new bots whenever they can find the right materials.
The result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike.
One might have six short legs and a pair of mis-matched claws for arms,
while another might use two rotor fans to fly,
but have only a single slender manipulator to pick things up.

Bots have Size, Fitness, Coordination, and IQ scores just like animal characters.
Their Sight and Hearing scores are Average by default,
but only a few bots have any sense of smell or taste at all.
(Most regard smell as slightly icky,
and would prefer that living creatures didn't talk about it so much.)

## Example Characters

### Madica

Madica is a teenage fox.
She has worked on her parents' fishing boat every day since she was a child,
so she is quite healthy.
She has a keen nose,
and is also very good with her hands:
she's had a lot of practice tying knots and mending nets,
and her mother has taught her a bit of singing and stage magic.

| Trait     | Rating  | Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Size      | Low     | Boating      | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | Fishing      | Very High |
| Dexterity | High    | Swimming     | High      |
| IQ        | Average | Knots        | High      |
| Sight     | Average | Stage Magic  | Low       |
| Hearing   | Average | Singing      | High      |
| Smell     | High    | Quarterstaff | High      |

### Rhymes With Orange

Rhymes With Orange was built to clean windows on ultra-tall skyscrapers.
It has long spidery limbs with suction cups for climbing,
but a very small body.
It also has a storage tank built into its back that can hold up to 5 liters,
and has modified the water jets on its arms to squirt almost any kind of liquid.
Rhymes With Orange's battery was damaged years ago
in an accident that robbed it of most of its memories.
It can only go 3-4 days without being recharged by another bot,
so it is constantly doing odd jobs in exchange for power
or gambling to try to win a recharge.
(It only cheats when it has to.)

| Trait     | Rating  | Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Height    | High    | Climbing     | Extreme   |
| Weight    | Low     | Acrobatics   | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | Gambling     | Very High |
| Dexterity | Average | Squirting    | High      |
| IQ        | Average | Mathematics  | High      |
| Sight     | Average | Navigation   | High      |
| Hearing   | Low     |              |           |
| Smell     | None    |              |           |

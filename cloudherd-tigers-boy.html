<p><em>Consider Cherne. A diamond adrift in the heavens, its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well. Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a century-long Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass, and littered the land with strange magic. When it was over the Pilots were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.</em></p>
<p><em>Now look there, where the Brumoso Mountains look down on the endless squabbles of the Ninety-Nine Kingdoms. A girl is doing her chores. No longer a child but not yet an adult, she has no idea that her world is about to change forever...</em></p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-soldiers">Chapter 1: Soldiers</h2>
<p>Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale. Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked between the twisted mountain pines.</p>
<p>&quot;Shoo.&quot; She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick. It waved its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away. Noxy cut the anchor threads of its with two practiced twists of her knife and began winding it onto a stick.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?&quot; Sensy asked, pulling a branch aside to see if another web lay beneath it.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced at her. &quot;Why? Are those ones coming loose?&quot;</p>
<p>Sensy looked down at her soft brown goofskin coat critically. &quot;No. They're just kind of plain.&quot; She sighed wistfully. &quot;Granna Fee has some really nice red ones. She said she'd give them to me if I weeded her pepper garden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her whole garden?&quot; Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder. &quot;That's a lot of work for some buttons you don't really need.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you're no help,&quot; Sensy pouted. She had spent the winter embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar. All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes and her hair and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale. Especially Rash---practically <em>anyone</em> would be more fun to be around than Rash.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes,&quot; Granna Fee had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who seemed to have taken her best friend's place.</p>
<p>&quot;Not me!&quot; Noxy had declared.</p>
<p>Granna Fee had laughed and ruffled her granddaughter's hair. &quot;No, daffodil, not you.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted, &quot;Soldiers! Soldiers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, great,&quot; she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy. The whole point of going out to collect spiderwebs that morning had been to get <em>away</em> from the younger children for a few hours.</p>
<p>Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked himself up and ran to the two girls. &quot;There's soldiers in the village!&quot; he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve. &quot;And they've been fighting! And there's a <em>tiger</em> with them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away. &quot;And there's a dragon under your bed.&quot; The pass below Stale were still blanketed in snow. Avalanches happened almost every day---someone would have to be foolish <em>and</em> desperate to be on the road this early in the spring.</p>
<p>&quot;But there <em>are</em>!&quot; Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to another with excitement. &quot;They've got swords, and some of them are bleeding! And the tiger can <em>talk</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth to say, &quot;Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?&quot; but a deep <em>doom doom</em> cut her off. She and Sensy looked at each other wide-eyed. <em>Doom doom</em>, pause. <em>Doom doom</em>, pause. It was Stale's home drum. It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed help to find their way home. It meant trouble.</p>
<p>Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch. &quot;Come on!&quot; she told Sensy, setting off at a run.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you!&quot; Young Gas shouted behind them. &quot;I told you there was---hey, wait for me!&quot;</p>
<p>Patches of ice made the path slippery underfoot, but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the ridge overlooking the village. There, in a clearing left by a long-ago lighting strike, she paused to catch her breath.</p>
<p>The ancient walls of the fortress of Stale lay below her. Rain and snow had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as the mountains themselves.</p>
<p>The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the walls like ducklings in a nest. Thin wisps of smoke rose from their slate chimneys, while vegetable plots and racks of drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.</p>
<p>To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge. A net woven from squirrel spiders' webs was stretched over its top, as light as a dream but as strong as steel. Another net hung down at the gorge's mouth to make a gate. Inside, just visible from the ridge, two gray clouds drifted half-asleep.</p>
<p>Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds, riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them. Grownups called the pair slow and lazy, but they were the most exciting things in Noxy's world---except, of course, for the herd of half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance.</p>
<p>Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her hand. &quot;Wait!&quot; she hissed, pointing into the trees. For a moment all Noxy saw was branches. Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and suddenly she could make out a hairy form in the trees.</p>
<p>Noxy's mouth went dry. She felt Sensy squeezed her hand, and squeezed back. As long as they didn't startle it...</p>
<p>Little Gas burst out of the bushes behind them and ran headlong into Noxy. &quot;Oof!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;What are you---mmph!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Noxy whispered urgently, her hand clamped over his mouth. &quot;Don't... move...&quot;</p>
<p>Before Young Gas could protest, the troll stepped into the clearing. His fur was silvered with age, and his eyes seemed as old as the mountains themselves. He and Noxy stared at each other for one long moment before he leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up into the tree. After one last look, he disappeared into the greenery.</p>
<p>Sensy was the first to speak. &quot;Wh-what's a troll doing <em>here</em>?&quot; she asked shakily, still holding Noxy's hand.</p>
<p>Noxy shook her head. &quot;Worry about that later. Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>The drum had stopped booming by the time the children reached the fortress wall. An enormous stone door stood half-open at the entrance, its iron hinges melted in some long-ago battle. The wooden gate that Stale's current human inhabitants had built to fill the gap was made of whole tree trunks, but still looked like a child's toy next to the Pilots' ancient work.</p>
<p>Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the main square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who had left a week ago to collect Stale's clouds from their wintering grounds in the high peaks. Three hundred people were there, from babies in their mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, all in an uncertain muttering half-circle.</p>
<p>A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front of them. Each one had a battle mask painted with fierce swirls of red and black pushed up on top of his head. Leather armor, as thick as bootsoles and studded with metal, protected their bodies, while heavy wool kilts reached from their waists to their knees. Some had swords in scabbards on their hips, while others had bows or spears, but each had a heavy pack on his back.</p>
<p>And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting. One man's hand was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling. None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.</p>
<p>But Noxy didn't see any of that right away. What she saw instead was the tiger. His stripes were dark brown on tan, not black on orange like the picture in the story book that three generations of village children had passed from hand to hand. A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear, and his tail twitched now and again as if the villagers' murmurs reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.</p>
<p>A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack as large as any of theirs. Four half-healed scars ran across his cheek, glistening redly against his near-black skin. His back was straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was from cold, weariness, or fear, Noxy couldn't tell.</p>
<p>Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve. &quot;Who <em>are</em> they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know. &quot;I'm trying to hear!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the square. &quot;Friends,&quot; she said in what Noxy thought of as her official voice, &quot;Friends, please. I know it is early in the year for travellers, but please greet Sergeant Dorbu and the Gifted Kulbinder.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers. The tiger merely blinked. &quot;They and their companions will be our guests for the next little while,&quot; Indy continued. &quot;I trust you will all make them welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long's a little while?&quot; Grappa Gas asked loudly. Noxy saw her mother wince. Everyone loved Grappa Gas---or nearly everyone---but as Granna Fee said, sometimes the old man had the manners of a constipated goof.</p>
<p>&quot;Until they are ready to travel again,&quot; Indy reassured him. Her eyes swept across the crowd. &quot;Their journey has been a hard one---they hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans. Sergeant? Would you like to say a few words?&quot;</p>
<p>The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as Indy stepped down. Like his men, his skin was black compared to the villagers' brown, and his head was fuzzy with wiry stubble. The two yellow ribbons around his sleeve were the only sign of his rank.</p>
<p>Before he could open his mouth, Grappa Gas asked, &quot;So, are you lot loyalists or rebels?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure he'll tell us if you give him a chance to speak!&quot; Heads turned as a burly man, all shoulders and scowl, pushed to the front of the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Noxy said under her breath. Grappa Gas's son Aft was the best cloudherd in Stale, at least in his own estimation. After one too many arguments over how best to round up the village herd, Indy had ordered him to stay behind and mend equipment instead of going with the other adults. Grappa Gas had happily taken the mayor's side, and father and son had been squabbling non-stop ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;Behave, both of you!&quot; Indy said sharply. She was a head shorter than either of the men, but the iron in her voice left no room for argument. She nodded at the sergeant. &quot;Please, go ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, thank you, honored,&quot; the soldier said gratefully. &quot;And thank you, people of Stale. As your mayor said, my comrades and I were trying to see if the pass to Chaghan was clear so that we could carry news to Chaghan. We---&quot; He paused, and for a moment Noxy could see how exhausted he was. &quot;There was an avalanche. Three days ago. It drove those of us who survived off the road into the forest. Everything seemed all right at first, but then the forest took offence and...&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Well, you can probably guess what happened next.&quot;</p>
<p>The villagers murmured. The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso Mountains from the rolling plain of Uws in the south to Garheim's frigid shores in the north and the orchards and farms of Ninety-Nine Kingdoms in the west. It wasn't as cruel as the Jungle of Thind, but it guarded its territory as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs. Gifted creatures that wanted to live in the forest did so on sufferance, while humans were not welcome at all, not unless they stuck to the handful of roads built long ago by the Pilots. Travellers who strayed off them were rarely given warnings, and <em>never</em> given second chances.</p>
<p>A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he continued. &quot;We finally made it back to the road, but the worst of our wounded couldn't go any further, so we left them in camp with a few of the able-bodied and came here for help.&quot; All traces of his earlier smile were gone. &quot;That was the day before last. I pray they're still all right, but if they are, they won't be for much longer.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas broke the silence that followed. &quot;So which side <em>are</em> you on?&quot; he asked, his voice still loud but a notch less rude.</p>
<p>&quot;I have the privilege of serving Respected Shudarga in this matter,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu answered calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Good for you!&quot; Aft said firmly, his look daring anyone to disagree.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas snorted loudly. &quot;Good for some, maybe, but what about us?&quot; As with everything else, he and his son had chosen opposite sides when Shudarga raised her flag. &quot;If King Denpa's men come looking for you, these walls won't keep them out for long.&quot;</p>
<p>The sergeants shook his head. &quot;We didn't choose Stale for its walls, honored. We didn't really choose it at all. We just washed up here because we need help. If you're afraid that'll bring trouble, we'll understand if you send us on our way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is sending anyone away,&quot; Indy said firmly. &quot;We mountain folk take pride in our hospitality. I'm sure we can find some spare blankets to keep you warm and stretch our stores enough to feed you for as long as you need to stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, honored,&quot; the sergeant said, bowing again. &quot;But what we really want is a couple of clouds so that we can go and rescue our friends.&quot;</p>

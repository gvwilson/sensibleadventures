After that there was nothing to do but follow the fireflies.  One at a
time, the bright flying sparks led them up toward the mountain's peak.
They didn't speak---what was there to say?

Razi raised his hand to halt them at the top of the final tilted
stairway.  The air was fresher.  "Cover your lanterns," he ordered. As
her eyes adjusted to the sudden darkness, Erileine could make out a
faint square of lesser darkness to their left.

They inched toward the tunnel mouth in single file. Sword sheathed,
Razi lay flat on the ground and slid forward.  "Come," he whispered a
moment later from outside.

He rose to his feet as the others joined him. They were standing at
the base of a cliff spattered with gritty patches of ice that gleamed
in the moonlight. The path beneath their feet had recently been
cleared. Dwarf cedars, none of them taller than Erileine's waist,
clung to the rocky slope that fell away from it, steeply at first and
then vertically, toward the lights of Forecastle. A few clouds hung in
the distance, too far from the mountain to be disturbed by its bulk.

Above them, Erileine heard hammering and voices. Something thudded
rhythmically; something else made a swishing noise every dozen
heartbeats or so.

Grim-faced, Razi released one final firefly. It buzzed in an uncertain
circle for a moment, then flew past them into the tunnel mouth.
"What---" Gaeston started, but Razi raised a finger to his lips. They
listened. Nothing, nothing... Footsteps. No, marching---there were
people in the tunnel, coming closer by the heartbeat.

"Duck's luck," Gaeston breathed.

"*La*, let us hope it holds," Razi said softly. "Erileine---here." He
handed the jar of fireflies to his apprentice, then put his hands
together. As Erileine stepped into them, the bookster boosted er.
Erileine scrambled up a couple of strides up the rock face..

"What's she going to do up there?" Laeuc asked the bookster in a low
voice.

"Not get killed," Razi replied just as quietly.  Raising his voice, he
continued, "Take what cover you can. *Sra* Gaeston, on the right if
you please. And you should know, I have never liked you."

Gaeston pulled up short. "What?"

The bookster grinned. "*La*, at a moment like this, a man should lighten
his soul as much as he can, and there is no one else here to whom I
might confess." He looked up at Erileine, his grin still on his face,
raised his sword in a graceful salute, and then swept it back to the
ready.

*Tramp tramp tramp.* The first pair of soldiers emerged.  Erileine
couldn't see their faces, but one of them had time to make a jerky
grab for his sword before Laeuc's arrow hit his leg. His partner was
already falling; Razi was already cutting at the man behind him as
Gaeston shouted, "Avaunt and her captain!" and lunged forward.

Metal rang on metal. Voices shouted. "Drop for the shot!" Laeuc nearly
screamed. "Drop for the shot!" He struggled up the slope and fired his
second arrow point blank at a Hett who had spilled out of the
tunnel. It spanged against the soldier's breastplate.

As Laeuc snatched another arrow from the quiver on his hip, the Hett
knocked his bow away with a contemptuous swipe of his sword. "Yield,"
the Hett ordered. Slowly, shakily, Laeuc raised his hands.

More Hett emerged from the tunnel, throwing Gaeston and Razi onto the
path.  Razi was up in a heartbeat.  Gaeston struggled woozily,
bleeding from a gash across his face, but couldn't keep his feet under
him.  Laeuc reached out to steady him.  A soldier knocked his arm
away.

More soldiers, and then---Erileine swallowed drily. Four Hett in
emerged with a pair of bamboo poles over their shoulders.  Slung
between the poles was a square stone casket an arm's length on a side.

One of the soldiers standing next to the captured Avauntois barked a
question. The officer shook his head. "*Ashenope arra te Uremme Bech
paurenatepe ejo*," he replied. He studied Razi for a moment, then
waved a hand. "*Keneshwe!*"

As the Hett next to him pulled cords from their belt pouches, the
bookster looked up at Erileine. "Release them," he said loudly.
"Release them all."

Erileine stared back, not understanding. "I said, release them!" Razi
repeated urgently. As one of the Hett cuffed him, Erileine pulled the
jar of fireflies from her pocket and pulled off the lid.

A thousand buzzing sparks threw themselves at the casket. The Hett
commander spun, drawing his sword and shouting, turning back just in
time for Razi's elbow to smash into the bridge of his nose. The two Hett
who had been beside him struggled to their feet as the bookster ducked a
hasty sword thrust, kicked a knee, rose spinning to catch an arm---

---and fell to the ground like a wet shirt. Twenty strides away, the
gray-robed Hett who had cast the spell strode forward, one hand on the
shoulder of the soldier beside her for guiance.

"*Deshwe!*" Erileine looked down. Two crossbows were pointed at him.
Two other Hett had their swords drawn. Shaking, he climbed down.  just
as the blind Hett magician reached Razi. "*Auedje ne atarappa
paurenatepe ke fe iuadje te?*" she demanded coldly.

The bookster had managed to roll onto his back, but was still unable to
rise. "*La*, my apologies, but I don't speak---"

"Liar," the Hett magician said in Avauntois. She spat on the ground
beside him. "Murderer. Tell me, how many men have you killed tonight?"

"I regret that," the bookster replied calmly. "Truly, I do."

"Tell it to their families," she snapped. She was younger than she had
first seemed, Erileine realized---probably not much older than
Queçenne. "I am tired of my people dying, do you understand that? I am
tired of people who have done no harm in this world being beaten by
drunks, or driven from their homes by mobs, or robbed blind by petty
lordlings who know that no one will defend them. Your mistress has
done nothing to help us---*nothing*---and neither has anyone else, so
now we are going to help ourselves."

"I grieve for your wounds," Razi said. "But what was done to you does
not make right what you would do here."

"No it doesn't," she agreed coldly. "But it will stop it from ever
happening again. *Etne aue petneshas she!*"

"No!" Erileine shouted as four Hett grabbed Razi's arms and legs. "You
can't!"

The magician ignored her.  The soldiers carried Razi a few strides
down the steep slope.  Counting, "*Ett... tven... trea!*" they threw
him over the side.

Erileine barely noticed her hands being bound behind his back. She
stumbled up the path in a daze behind her father and Gaeston. First
Fraederiq, then Uyves, his papaere, Armaend and Donaien, and now
Razi...  How could they all---

"Saints love us," his father said. Erileine looked up. They had
reached the peak.

An area the size of the market square in Forecastle had been scraped
clean. In its center was a flat-topped stone pyramid with a flight of
steps leading up one side. Glowing plates of dayglass stood around it,
each larger than any piece Erileine had ever seen.

A man with ram's horns stood on top of the pyramid. Four elderly Hett
in gray robes waited patiently on the stairs, light glinting from the
iron marbles where their eyes should have been.

Strange machines had been assembled on the rocks around the pyramid.
They were made of gold and glass, of granite, of brightly-colored
coral and enormous bones, all connected by gears and cables and things
Erileine didn't have names for. An eerie blue light rose from one
machine like steam from a kettle. A face appeared above another, ten
times bigger than life but too narrow to be human, its mouth open as
if to laugh or scream, then vanished. As it did so, the rumbling
beneath their feet suddenly stopped.

Their captors halted a dozen strides from the nearest machine. The two
carrying the casket hurried forward to the pyramid's base. Light
swirled around the machines in all the colors of the week, purple and
blue, green and yellow, orange, and deep, blood red.

Erileine could hear the machines now. They were singing to each other,
great long notes that ran from bone-tingling bass to fluting whistles
that made her ears ring. The air tingled as the light folded around
itself and became a shining emptiness too bright to look at. The
magicians were chanting in time with the machines' rhythmic pulse.

The magician on the bottom step opened the casket's lid. The light
from inside was unbearable. It wasn't too hot, or too bright: it was
too *real*. Erileine threw up her arm to cover her face, but the light
shone right through it---right through the whole world.

As one, the magicians on the stage cried out. Erileine lowered her arm
just in time to see the statue inhale the light. The whole world held
its breath for a moment, and then the statue opened its eyes and
tilted its head to one side. «Finally.» The word appeared inside
Erileine's head like a sliver of ice dropped into a pool of water.

The Hett raised their arms. "Aya! Aya! Aya!" they shouted. "It is done!
It is done! It is done!"

"My lord." Tears ran down the Hett magician's face, but her voice was
strong. "My lord, welcome. Welcome back."

«Who are these?» The statue's thought somehow took in the Avauntois.

"Unhearing ones, my lord. They tried to prevent your return."

«They failed.»

"Yes, my lord. Do you wish them returned to the earth?"

«No.» The statue slowly swept its gaze around the chamber, taking in the
now-silent machines, the awestruck Hett, and the silent, watchful
balconies. «This place is a mess.»

"Yes, my lord."

«It needs mending.»

"*Yes*, my lord." The magician's voice was exultant.

The statue's eyes were steel marbles, Erileine noticed. Even without
that, and the horns coiled on either side of its head where its ears
should have been, and its hairlessness, and the complete lack of
anything male or female between its legs, it still wouldn't have
passed for human. It was too perfect.

«This ship is damaged.» Each word came perfectly formed into Erileine's
mind. «It needs mending. There are deserts where there should be
gardens. The moon has strayed from its course.»

"Slow poisons rot the heart of the world, and monsters roam free." The
Hett magician spoke the words aloud in time with the statue. Others
joined in, some weeping with joy. "We must mend what is broken."

«We must mend what is broken.» the statue agreed. Its steel gaze fell on
the Avauntois. «Go and tell the world. The Great Work begins.»

One moment they were standing in the heart of the mountain. The next,
they were back in Starboard Town, just outside the gate of the
Captain's House. Gaeston swore.  "What in all hells was that!?"

"I think it was an Pilot," Erileine said.

"But they're dead!"

Erileine shook her head. "Not any more."

Anything she might have added was cut off as the ground
lurched. Slowly but inexorably, the mountain began to turn over.

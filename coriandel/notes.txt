- why didn't Ishad go in with Vurt?
- if Kembe knew it wasn't over, why didn't she say so in her chapter?
- did Shau Sheu and Oe rob Vurt?
+ introduce Patience when Vurt and Ishad row in (split the chapter)
+ Kembe knows that oaths only take hold when a spirit wills it (in this case, Cup)
+ mention Ishad's lucky boots, then he gives them to Vurt - make it clear they were spoil from Armaq

- the blood oath is awkward: make it a one in a thousand chance?
  - have Shau Sheu prime Vurt to swear to it
- the "slow spell" doesn't make sense
  - need to make it clear that there's no such thing
  - and that the mechanics haven't ever been explained to the aunt
  - "people believe what they want to" (but needs to be ironic: what does Shau Sheu want to believe?)
- take out the ghost reversal stuff (doesn't make sense)
- present-day chapters in present tense, past chapters in past tense
  - and final chapter from the ghost's point of view in the future tense?
- mention the religious politics of the Pilot Angels
  - Thindi are emulators: we should live as they did
  - Bantangui are preparing for the day of the return
  - Kembe is a celebrant: happy they're gone and people run their own lives (if she was anything)

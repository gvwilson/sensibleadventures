A ninja's attention never wanders.
That's what Leonard told me, anyway.
He said that a ninja's mind is always filled
by whatever is in front of it.
Show a ninja a tree,
and all the ninja thinks is "tree".
He doesn't wonder
how old the tree is,
or start daydreaming about the tree that was in his back yard
when he was a kid
and how he and his brother used to climb around in it
until it was knocked over in a storm
and his father
used it for firewood to heat the house
that he and his brother ran away from
a few years later
because of how crazy his father got when he was drunk.
Give a ninja a bomb
and tell him to wire it to someone's bike
and that's all he'll think about.
His mind won't wander,
and he won't make dumb mistakes.

Too bad I wasn't a ninja.

Leonard had made some greasy yellow stuff
that he swore was "just like" plastique.
I stuck a lump of it
under the motorcycle's spell box
and looked around nervously.
There were about two dozen bikes
of all different kinds
parked in the gloom around me.
I would've traded the scrap pile I rode
plus either of my legs for any of them.
By the time I finished the thought
my hand had found the rolled-up wires in my jacket pocket.
I untangled the red one
and stuck an end into the plastique.
The other end went down to the battery
I'd clipped beside the kickstand.

The Blood clubhouse was in an old parking garage.
They kept their bikes on the first floor,
and their parties on the second.
As I crouched there
and cut the black return wire to the right length
I strained to make out what the voices
drifting down the concrete ramp behind me were saying.
I probably would've had more luck if I spoke Elvish.
At least they weren't getting louder, or closer.

I scraped insulation off the freshly-cut end
of the black wire with my knife
and jammed it into the plastique.
The other end was supposed to go to a contact switch,
and the switch was supposed to be put under the starter.
But just then an amplified voice started to sing
and without thinking
I clipped the black wire directly to the battery.

A blue-white spark went *flash!*
and the lump of plastique went *"phut!"*
A little tail of stinking smoke started to come out around the wires.

I swear I only froze for a moment.
I remember thinking
that the band upstairs was playing the song much too fast.
Then I scurried to the back stairway
I'd snuck up,
stopped,
scurried back to the bike and picked up my knife,
and then ran full-speed back to the stairs.

I took them three at a time
and squeezed through
the old wooden door that hung lop-sided
at the bottom without slowing down.
The alley outside looked the same as it had
five minutes earlier when I'd started my slow creep
up the cracked concrete stairway.
Leonard was waiting by my bike around the corner.
"What happened?  What happened?" he whispered frantically.

"Never mind.  Get on!"
I kicked the bike into life
and shouted "Get on!" again,
then roared off toward Ho Street.

Conversation on a motorcycle is never easy.
When you're frightened and angry and trying to put distance
between yourself and a bunch of Bloods
it's not even worth trying.
I kept my mind on driving
and ignored Leonard
until we got out of Blood territory
and back into the slums south of the Ho.
I pulled up in the parking lot of
Greenjeans bar
and killed the motor.

"Well?" Leonard asked over my shoulder.
"You gonna tell me what's goin' on?"

"Get off my bike."
I was looking straight ahead.
I felt him swing one leg over.
The suspension
squeaked as he got off.
I dismounted on the other side,
still looking at the bar.
I took a deep breath and let it out.

"Nothing happened,"
I said.
"No boom.
Not even a bang, nothing."

"What?  Of course nothing happened,
plastique only goes off when you spark it,
what's the—"

"Leonard!"
I turned and looked at him.
The scruffy black jean jacket he was wearing
made him look even skinnier than he was.
He still hadn't sewn on
any more football or basketball patches,
I noticed.
Stupid.
Stupid of me to waste time noticing.
"I sparked it, okay?
Click, like that,
and nothing happened.
The stuff was dud."

Leonard stared at me for a moment
and then gulped.
"Oh shit.
That means they're all going to be duds.
I'm in trouble, aren't I?"

I nodded.
"Yeah.
What's Battleaxe gonna do
when they don't go off?
He's sitting around the Castle,
half the Team just put their asses out in the wind
crawling around Blood territory setting the damn things,
he spent a week,
shit,
Leonard,
he spent a week taking lessons from *you* on how to wire the things up,
and nothing's going to happen!"
I realized I had been shouting.
"Yeah, you're in trouble all right,"
I continued in a normal voice.
"Question is,
what do we do about it?"

For a moment I thought he was going to start crying.
Not because he was afraid—anyone who's grown up
on the streets of Bordertown
isn't going to cry because they're afraid.
"It's not fair,"
he said, starting to tremble.
"The first batch worked fine.
You saw it, Stumpy,
you know it worked.
Battleaxe saw it too.
I did everything the book said."

"Yeah, well," I pulled off my gloves
and stuck them in the top of my jeans.
"Books don't know everything.  'Specially World books.
This is Bordertown,
Leonard.
You been here all your life,
you oughta know that by now.
World stuff don't work the same way twice."

He took off his glasses
and rubbed his eyes with the same hand,
hugging himself with the other arm.
When he put his glasses back on he'd stopped trembling.
"So why'd you stop here?" he asked.
"Come on, let's get it over with."

"You don't want a drink or three first?"
I waved at Greenjeans.

"Won't do any good," he said regretfully.
"Just make it feel worse in the morning."

"I hope there *is* a morning," I said.
For a moment he looked frightened again,
but then he smiled and stuck his tongue through the gap
where his two front teeth used to be.

Leonard was always like that.
Everybody always pushed him around.
Sometimes you could see how it got to him,
but usually it just sort of slid off, like oil off leather.
It was like he didn't really notice what people were doing to him.
Even when our dad used to beat us up
Leonard would always stand there
and try to talk him out of it,
as if you could talk to someone who switched
from vodka to Mad River water
the day after the Change.

In between beatings Leonard would try to patch us both up
with whatever he could find around the house,
and read stories out of pre-Change books he'd scrounge,
and play with his science stuff.
He was always hooked on science and comic books and things like that.
That's what got him into the Team.
I got in for the same reasons as most people,
because I was tough,
or thought I was,
and because belonging to a gang
beat standing outside Danceland on a Friday night
without the silver to get in.
Leonard got in
because he could make stink bombs and stuff that made you
need to shit.

I took a slow route back to the Castle.
A lot of bikes were already there,
covered in the baseball and football crests
that Battleaxe had declared fashionable
when he became king.
One of the Chugger twins
was just getting off his bike as we parked.
"Yo Stump," he said.
"Go okay?"
He was wearing a Black Sox t-shirt under his leather jacket,
a couple of ice hockey badges on his jeans,
and a blue-on-white stripe in his hair.
A standard Team outfit,
in other words,
maybe a little less garish than most.

I shook my head.
"Naw.
Talk about it inside, okay?"
He shrugged and muttered a couple of words to spell-lock his bike,
then jogged up the fire escape and
into the Castle.
"You okay, Leonard?"
Leonard pushed his glasses up his nose and nodded.

I went up first.
The Castle had been a school before the Change.
The first floor had collapsed,
but the second floor was still okay,
except for a couple of places where it sagged.
Most of the inside walls had been knocked down.
It gave the place the same half-ruined
look of most of Bordertown.
The inside was lit by some stolen lamps and a couple of candles.
Blankets and boards over the windows kept our affairs private.

As usual,
Battleaxe was sitting on his throne.
It was just an old stuffed chair on top of a teacher's desk,
but you wouldn't have wanted to tell him that.
Being up there made him look even taller than he was,
which was pretty tall for a human,
especially when compared to me.
He was letting his hair grow back,
but still only had a thin steel-wool fuzz.
"Ah, Leonard,"
he said when we came through the window,
"Leonard, my man, my magic man,
welcome home.
And you too, Stumpy.
Stand up where we can see you, lad."
One of the girls giggled.
I don't know why.
Battleaxe made the same stupid joke every time he saw me.
"I trust you encountered no difficulties?"

I opened my mouth.
Leonard poked his elbow into my stomach
before I could say anything.
"Umh, no, not quite," he said.
He took his glasses off and put them on a table
beside a rancid beer bottle.

"Not quite?" 
Battleaxe stood and jumped lightly down to the floor.
I slipped Leonard's glasses into my pocket
as inconspicuously as possible.
"Pray tell, what would you mean by, 'not quite'?"
He walked over to us.
The two dozen other people in the room had fallen quiet.

"I think I made a mistake," Leonard said.
I closed my eyes and
told myself that it would be okay,
that real ninjas knew how to control themselves.
"I don't think the bombs are going to go off."

"You don't…I must be hearing incorrectly.
Leonard, Leonard, magic man that you are,
did you not guarantee me,
did you not swear to me that we had a winner with these babies?
Huh?"
Battleaxe stretched out a long, lazy arm and took
a light grip on
the collar of my brother's jacket.
"You showed me one,
do you remember that?
Boom boom, remember?
So what's the problem?"
By the time he'd finished he'd pulled Leonard
until their faces were no more than an inch apart.

"I, uh, did some tests," Leonard said
as calmly as he could.
"I don't think this batch of plastique is going to work.
The one I set off for you was the last batch.
I think I might've used too much—"
Battleaxe's fist went in at Leonard's belly-button
and up under his ribs.
Leonard doubled over and started to sag.

"Oh no you don't, you little puke," Battleaxe grunted.
He pulled Leonard up and hit him again.
I could feel my legs trembling.

"Don't, Stumpy."
The other Chugger twin was standing behind me.
"Not the time for politics.
Your brother fuck up,
is what people say.
Battleaxe got a bet going, 'member?
Make him look bad.
Make us all look bad."
His voice was soft,
soothing,
the sort of voice you used to quiet down
an angry dog at a grocery store
you're about to rob.
I thought about what it had been like before
the Team let us join and I shut up.

Battleaxe was too angry to do a good job.
He stopped halfway through
long enough to get a mouthful of wine.
For a moment I thought he was going to
screw the glass into Leonard's face,
but he just spat instead.
I watched the whole thing,
from beginning to end.
I counted the punches, too, just for the record.

Eventually Battleaxe got bored.
He prodded Leonard with his toe.
Leonrd moaned.
"You hear me in there, asshole?" he asked.
"You better.
I bet every ounce of silver the Team owns
that we'd show the Bloods some thunder and lightning.
Pray tell do you understand?
People are expecting great and grand things
from the new king of the Team,
and I'm bitterly, bitterly disappointed
that you've let me down."

"I'm sorry, Basketball."
Leonard's voice sounded as thick as a drunk's.
I winced even before the kick came.

"The name, my little worm, is Battleaxe.
Or are you blind as well as stupid?"
He poked the tattooed axe on his cheek with his thumb.
"Basketball was somebody else.
Now, get up on your feet.
I said GET UP ON YOUR FEET!"
Leonard rolled over to get his feet under him,
then straightened his legs.
I wouldn't have called it standing.

"That's better."
Battleaxe looked at me and grinned lazily,
then looked back at my brother.
"Now, listen very carefully.
You have until this time tomorrow night,
this exact time tomorrow night,
to make a big noise happen underneath the Bloods,
do you understand?
If you don't,
you'd better pray that they're the ones that catch you,
because all those faggot elves will do is cut your useless throat."
Leonard's head moved up and down.
"Good.
You promised me you could deliver, magic man.
I would suggest you start delivering
as soon as possible.
Now, get out from where I can see you."
Leonard turned and stumbled toward the exit window.
He remembered to bump into me on the way out
so I could slip him his glasses.

If the Chugger twins hadn't been standing behind me
I would've gone with him.
I might even have been mad enough to try
a title fight with Battleaxe then and there.
But being in the Team beat fighting with stray cats for scraps,
so I kept my mouth shut and tried not to look at anybody.

Battleaxe turned to the crowd.
"How many of you
managed to put those shit lumps in place?"
he asked.
A few voices grunted or said yes.
"Okay.
I want the word spread.
Tell the world,
especially tell any faggot elves you see,
that we were generous tonight,
do you understand?
We proved our point.
We are *the* numero uno indie gang around.
We could've turned them all into greasy hamburger like they deserve,
but we didn't,
because we are a merciful Team."
He leapt lightly back onto the desk
and seated himself in his throne.
"Now, since we can't celebrate victory,
let us celebrate humiliation."

Battleaxe got drunk as quickly as he could.
He started talking about elves,
about how he hated elves,
about how Bordertown
had been built by men,
it belonged to men.
I wanted to ask him
how come he tried so hard to sound like them
and move like them
and how come he dressed like them
if he hated them so much,
but I was smart enough for once to keep my mouth shut.

Most of the Team got drunk with him.
We had some good parties sometimes,
especially in the summer when we could get out in the streets
and play ball.
But this party wasn't one of the good ones.
Not many had been since Battleaxe won the throne
and changed his name
and started his vendettas against every other gang
and gang faction he could find.
I stayed on the side and didn't dance.
Every once in a while
one of the Chugger twins or one of the other guys
I got along with
would wander over and make a few noises.
Always one at a time,
to avoid attracting attention.

His girlfriend Peaches
stuck to him the whole time like a piece of gum
in the middle of summer.
She wasn't really "his" girlfriend,
more like the girlfriend of whoever happened to be running
the Team.
Her long black hair was lit up by a witchlight spell,
and every once in a while she'd point at someone's bottle
and whisper
and the beer would spurt up like a geyser
and everyone would laugh.
I hung around until most of the night's beer was gone,
then slipped out.

Leonard and I lived in an attic,
in the stretch where the slums started turning into the suburbs.
He kept all his chemicals and books in boxes on the floor,
and I kept the steel pipes I used for barbells on a rack on the wall.
Leonard wasn't in when I got there.
The tattered red nylon pack he used was gone,
and there was fresh blood on one of the towels
by the washbucket,
so at least I knew he'd made it home.
I was tired and I felt sick,
so I rolled up in a couple of blankets
and passed out.

When I woke up it was the middle of the afternoon
and Leonard was shaking my shoulder.
"Whassamatter?" I mumbled.

"Stumpy, you gotta help me,
I can't lift this stuff by myself."

"Wha?"  I opened my eyes a little wider and blinked.
"Oh no, Leonard.
You all right?"
He looked worse in the light than I'd thought he would,
with a bruise the size of a pizza on one side of his face
and a lot of blue patches on the other.
I could guess from the way he was standing how much he hurt.

"Course I'm all right.
Man of steel, what do you think?"
He was too tired to make it a joke.
"I got it figured out, Stumpy.
I know how I'm gonna do it,
but I can't get the stuff up the stairs.
Gimme a hand?"

"'S it gotta be done right away?"
Immediately I was sorry.
"Okay, hang on a second, 'll get up."

He shook his head, and sat down gingerly
on the seat we'd torn out of a pre-Change Ford
to use as a couch.
"Naw, don't bother.
It'll keep.
You hungry?"

I hadn't been until he asked.
"Yeah.  You eat yet?"

He shook his head.
"No time," he said.
"Had to get out and scrounge.
Hey, look what I found."
He opened up his bag and pulled out something black and round.

"What is it?" I asked.

"It's a lens, a telephoto lens for a camera."
He saw the expression on my face.
"It's for making far-away stuff look like it's close,"
he explained.

I just had to laugh.
"Leonard, come on," I said.
"Why do you keep wasting your time on that stuff?
Cameras don't work here."

He shook his head again.
"No, no, I think it's just the *old* cameras and film that don't work.
If I can discover a new type of film or something
then people could take pictures.
It'd make me famous, Stumpy.
Rich, too,"
he added practically.

"You get everything you need to make some more bombs?"
I asked, to change the subject.

"Yeah," he said.
"The fireworks place down in Dragontown.
I'm gonna be sweeping floors and making soap
for a couple of months
payin' it all off.
It's, uh, gonna make this place stink," he apologized.

I snorted.
"Wouldn't notice.
Should be soup in the pot."
He turned around and started poking around in the dirty dishes
piled up beside our water bucket.

"You okay?" I asked after a moment.
"I mean, you really okay?
I couldn't do anything, Leonard."

"I know," he said without turning around.
He pulled a plate from the bottom of the pile
and wiped it with his sleeve.
"Hey, how long's it been since we had chili?
Yeah, last night,
I couldn't do anything either.
I shouldn't have had to."
He looked straight at me.
My gut froze until he continued,
"The plastique should've worked.
I don't know why it didn't.
The first batch did.
I did everything the same,
why didn't it work?"

"This isn't the World,
Leonard," I reminded him.
"Magic doesn't work all the time either.
Maybe—"

"Magic?"
He whirled around.
"The hell with magic!
This is *science*!
You do the same thing twice,
you should get the same results twice, right?
How am I supposed to do science in this place
if nothing ever happens the same way twice?
It's not fair!"

"Maybe you shouldn't be so hung up on science,"
I said cautiously.

"You wanna know what makes me mad?
I mean, what really makes me mad?" he continued.
"That idiot last night calling me 'magic man' all the time.
This is science, Stumpy.
It's got nothing to do with elves
or dragons or any of that shit.
It's not fair."
He looked close to tears again.
I stood up and walked over.

"Come on," I said.
I put my hand on his shoulder and steered him toward the door.
"Let's get this mysterious stuff of yours upstairs
and then get something to eat."
He sniffled and went out ahead of me.

Three hours later
he was lying in the bed I'd vacated,
snoring lightly .
I'd let him have most of the soup.
I don't think he noticed.
He spent the whole time talking about
combustion and other scientific stuff
that I didn't know anything about,
then started filling up empty bottles
with a mixture of tar and some white chalky stuff
he said was fertilizer.
He was right.
It did stink.

I did some weights and some kata
until the sun was half-way down,
then went and re-filled the water bucket
at the tap in the old firehouse on the corner.
I woke Leonard when I got back.
His body still didn't want to let him move,
but he got himself up and dressed.
Growing up with someone like our father
teaches you a lot about mornings after.

We ate some bread that Leonard had got
in exchange for some paint he'd made
(it wasn't very good bread,
but then I don't think it had been very good paint)
and tried to think up a plan.
Leonard wanted to do the same thing we'd done the previous night,
park in the alley and sneak up the fire escape,
but I told him not to be stupid,
they'd be sure to have a guard out there tonight.
We kept arguing after we finished eating.
I did some more weights
and poked holes in Leonard's ideas
when I had enough breath,
and he fiddled around with his chemicals
and some strips of film
he was trying to develop.
Eventually we came up with a plan of sorts.
Leonard hung his film strips up to dry
and we went down to my bike.

I drove us up Ho Street and around
the edge of the slums
in a wide arc.
We wound up twelve blocks from where we'd started,
right in the heart of Blood territory.
It was about midnight
when we got to the alleyway.

The back entrance I'd snuck up the previous night
was at the end of a short alley
that formed the stubby arm of a four-way intersection.
I stopped a block away on the street opposite the alley
and said,
"You ready?"
Leonard's arms squeezed tighter around my middle.
"Okay, then," I shouted, "Let's go!"
I gunned the bike.

I don't know what Leonard was thinking
right then,
but I felt like a
commando from one of the stories we used to read.
I whooped as we
shot through the intersection and into the alley.

We hit the door at the bottom of the stairs
and burst through the rotten wood
with a crash.
The bike stumbled on the first step,
then found its nose.
We were halfway up the stairs in an instant.

"Now!  Now!" I yelled at Leonard.
He slipped off the back of the bike
and squeezed past me.

An elf with blue face paint
and a tall crest of silver hair
appeared at the top of the stairs.
Before he could do anything
Leonard had lit the cloth fuse of the first bottle.
He threw it in a flat arc.
The bottle hit the top stair
and burst into flame with a belch.
Leonrd lit the second fuse with the same match
and chucked it through the flames
into the open doorway.

"Hurry up!" I shouted.
I got my arms under the bike and lifted its nose,
then spun it around on its back tire
and dropped it
so that it was facing down the stairs.
"Hurry up and get on!"

He lit one last bottle.
"Going away present!" he said.
He grinned at me like a crazy man.
Suddenly the grin disappeared.
"Look out!"
I ducked.
Something whistled past me.
I turned around and pulled my knife out of my sleeve.

There was another elf at the bottom of the stairs
wearing a patchwork feather jacket
and a wicked-looking slingshot.
"Get down!" Leonard shouted.

I didn't need to.
I'm short, and I was downhill.
The bottle went over me easily.
It went over the elf, too,
but burst against the doorway behind him.
The incandescent tar waterfalled down on him.
He screamed as the sticky flames
splashed on his hair and shoulders.
He kept screaming as
he fell backward through the doorway.

I swung my leg over the bike and pushed it forward,
trying to start the engine at the same time.
"I'm on, I'm on!" Leonard yelled in my ear.

We bumped down to the bottom of the stairs.
A pool of burning tar blocked the doorway.
"What do we do?"
I shouted.

"Go right through it!"
Leonard shouted back.
I nodded and revved the engine.
The bike leapt ahead.
We slipped an inch on the flames
and then we were out.

As we shot through the door
Leonard fell off the back of the bike
and rolled on the pavement.
The rear tire shrieked as I jammed the brakes on.
"What are you doing?" I screamed.
I looked up.
All the windows on the floor above us were flickering with
orange light.
I could hear shouting.
Leonard tore off his jacket and jumped on top of
the burning elf.
He beat at the flames,
then wrapped the jacket around the elf's body.
"You moron!" I shouted as he scrambled back to the bike.
"You could've got us killed!"
We roared away.

We'd gone about four blocks toward Team territory
when Leonard slapped me on the shoulder twice.
I pulled over to the side.
"What's the—Leonard!"
He was throwing up on the side of the road.

"Hey, you little puke,
you clean that up."
An elf with black feathers and red ribbons in his hair stopped
with his hands on his hips.
"This belong to you?"
he asked me.

"I'll clean it up," I said grimly.
Out of the corner of my eye
I thought I could see orange light on the horizon.
"Come on, Leonard, let's go home.
You've had enough for one night."
I found an old copy of *Nightlife* in the top of an overflowing garbage bucket
and scraped up as much of the vomit as I could,
ignoring the remarks of the elves passing by.

"How many do you think I killed?"
Leonard asked
when we parked below the clubhouse.
I shrugged.

"Probably didn't kill any.
Probably just messed up their bikes.
It doesn't matter, does it?"

"No, I guess not."
He sat down on the hood of a rusted-out car
that had been in the parking lot
long before I'd been around.
"I gotta get out of here, Stumpy," he said tiredly.
"This is killing me.
I want to do real science,
not just bombing and blowing stuff up."

"It's the only kind of science you're gonna get around here,"
I told him.
"World costs money,
and last time I looked we didn't have any.
Come on,
let's tell Battleaxe what happened
and then go and get some sleep."

He stopped me as I turned toward the fire escape.
"Richard," he said.

"What?"

"Thanks.  I mean, thanks for saying 'we'."

"No problem."

Battleaxe wasn't on his throne,
he was dancing a slow dance with Peaches
while two other Team members
played guitar and flute.
She was grinding herself against him
and slobbering on his neck
and he was holding onto her ass.
He saw us come in
but waited a couple of minutes before he let go of her.
"Well?" he said.

"It's done," I told him.
"Whole place is probably burned out by now."

His face stretched into his ugly, lazy smile.
"Well well welly well," he said.
He picked up a bottle and a dirty paper cup.
"Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, your attention!"
The music stopped.
"I drink a toast!
I drink a toast to Leonard,
our very own Doctor Death!"

"To Leonard!" everyone repeated dutifully.
I glared at a couple of snickers.

"Now," Battleaxe said,
putting the bottle down
and handing the cup to Leonard.
"Nothing too good for you tonight, Sir Leonard.
Peaches!
Peaches, my dear girl,
show this man our royal appreciation."

The snickers got louder.
Peaches licked her lips and cooed,
"Little me?
I don't know if I'm woman enough for him.
Why, he might just eat me all up."
She half-walked, half-pranced over to Leonard.
I could see one of the cheap little spells she used
sparkling around her hair,
turning the sullen bad-girl look on her face
into pure seduction.

Leonard couldn't see it, of course.
He was the target.
He was standing dead still
with the cup of wine in his hand untouched,
hypnotized,
like a child who knows a blow is coming
and knows there's no way to avoid it.
"Why, there's no telling what he might do, is there?"
She put her arms around his neck and lightly kissed him
on the nose,
then on the cheek,
then pulled off his glasses and dropped them on the floor.

"Hey, my—mmmmph."
She pulled Leonard to her and started slobbering
the way she'd just been slobbering over Battleaxe,
with all the hip grinding and tit rubbing and everything.
A couple of guys whooped.
Leonard took it for a moment,
then dropped the paper cup and
put his arms around her.

"Life in the boy yet," Battleaxe observed.
Suddenly Peaches shrieked.

"You cheap little shit!
Battleaxe, he just grabbed my boobs!"
Leonard was staring at her in confusion.
No, please no, I whispered silently,
his guard's down,
he made a mistake.

"Leonard?  Grabbed you?
Impossible, my dear,
must be one of his magic spirits.
Leonard would never do a thing like that."
Battleaxe picked up Leonard's glasses and handed them
to him.

"Thank you," Leonard said.

"Oh, don't thank me, good man,"
Battleaxe said with a smile.
"Thank this!"
He put his fist halfway back to Leonard's spine.
Leonard went down without a sound.

"Now I only look like half an asshole,"
Battleaxe told the crumpled shape on the floor.
"You know where the other places were
that we were going to do last night?
Good.
You get them done.
*All* of them.
You get them done or you don't show your face around here,
and until you get them done
you watch your step."
He looked up at me.
"Got something to say, dwarf?"
he asked me.

I looked at his feet and shook my head.
"I could've sworn I heard you say something,"
he continued.
I shook my head again.
He lost interest in the game.
"Take him home, get him cleaned up.
You two have work to do.
Yo, musicians!
A festive chorus, if you please!"
He grabbed Peaches and whirled her around.
I helped Leonard to his feet
and got him home.

I woke up the next day
before he did,
which hardly ever happened.
I watched him sleeping for a few minutes,
then stood up and wrote
"Gon to work be bak tonite"
on the blackboard by the window and left.
I walked down to Greenjeans
to save the spell charge in the bike.

I spent the afternoon moving beer barrels around
and telling myself that it was just as good for me
as weightlifting,
maybe better,
because at the end of it I got a
little link of silver chain
to buy some food with.
I got some eggs and some bread
and a bottle of very cheap wine,
then agonized for a few minutes
before trading one of my brass earrings for a copy of *Stick Wizard*.

When I got back Leonard was still in bed,
but at least he was awake.
"You okay?" I asked.
He nodded and sighed.

"How many bombs did I make?" he asked.

"Five, I think.
Hey, Leonard, don't worry about it.
Battleaxe'll forget.
You don't have to—"

"Sure I do,"
he interrupted.
"It's bad enough when I'm in the gang.
You wanna try and imagine what he'd do to me
if I quit?"
He flung off the blanket and stared at the ceiling.
"How come he's running things, anyway?"
he asked after a moment.

"He's running things because he beat Swell,"
I reminded him.
"You remember?
Beat him in a title fight?
Broke both his legs with a baseball bat
and dumped him down by the brewery?
That's how come Battleaxe is running things."

"People shouldn't be allowed to run things
just 'cause they're tough,"
he said sullenly.
"It shouldn't be like that."

"It *is* like that!" I said in exasperation.
"You can't change it,
I can't change it,
Battleaxe can't change it,
it just is.
Now here,
I bought you a *Stick Wizard*.
Haven't even read it yet."
I tossed the comic book to him and started cutting
our last loaf of bread.

After we ate
Leonard started messing around with his books and chemicals.
When midnight came he just mumbled,
"Busy.  See you tomorrow."
I shrugged and left him.

Nobody noticed he wasn't there,
or if they did,
they didn't say anything.
All people were talking about was
how everyone on the street had heard about
the fire at the Blood clubhouse,
and how Battleaxe had won his bet.
Bullshit.

"Be a party tomorrow night!" Battleaxe kept repeating.
"Grand, grand party,
courtesy of our friends in the Pack."
There was a single guy there
in the black leather jeans and jacket of the Pack,
trying his best to look nonchalant.

Leonard was still working when I got home.
I told him about the party
and he nodded.
"Figured," he said.
When he asked me,
I told him that the candle-light wouldn't bother me,
so long as he didn't waste too much.
He nodded and went back to his brewing.

I was up before him the next day, too.
There was a note scrawled on the blackboard
that said,
"S: please take the soap in the box down to G & get your bike spelled.
Wake me up at sundown? L"
He always wrote long messages like that.
I took the soap down to one of the grocery stores
in the suburbs
that Leonard did business with
and traded it for some tomatoes.
Then I took the tomatoes to a witch a few blocks away
and had her put the spell back on my bike.
I sat around outside Greenjean's
hoping for work for the rest of the afternoon,
but nothing happened.

I went home around sundown.
Leonard was already up.
"Hi, Stumpy," he said.

"Leonard what the hell is that?"
I pointed at a bug-like box sitting on three bamboo legs.

"Would you believe it's a box camera?" he asked.
"Come on, help me pack it up.
I want to show it to Battleaxe."

I stared at him as if I didn't believe what I'd heard.
Which, in fact, I didn't.
"Leonard --"
I finally started.

"Hey!"
He cut me off sharply.
"Trust me, okay?"

It was awkward carrying it on the bike.
Leonard sat behind me and laid it crosswise between us.
I was glad we didn't see anyone I knew
on our way.

We got to the Castle about half an hour before midnight.
Counting the bikes in the lot
it looked like almost everyone else was already there.

"Leonard," I tried again.
"Maybe this isn't the time, you know?"

He pushed his glasses back up his nose and looked at me seriously.
"It's time," he said.
"Stumpy, believe me, it's time."

"Leonard…"
I didn't know what I wanted to ask,
but then I suppose
I didn't want to know the answer, either.
"You wanna let me carry that,
you bring the other stuff?"
He grinned at me and stuck his tongue out through his teeth.

The party was already rolling
when I stepped through the window
and pulled the tripod camera through behind me.
Battleaxe was standing on the throne
with a bottle in his hands,
toasting and drinking and laughing.
Peaches was on the floor in front of him,
dancing as a couple of guys
played mandolin and flute.
Off on the side of the crowd were two men
in black leather, not talking.
One of them had a square grey metal box in his hands.

"Just put it down there," Leonard said.
He was looking around as though
he'd never seen the inside
of the Castle before.

"Sure," I grunted as I set it down.
Leonard nodded at something, or someone,
then pushed his way through the dancers to Battleaxe.

It took him a couple of tries to get the king's attention.
Finally Battleaxe looked down at him and said something
with a mocking look on his face.
Leonard gestured earnestly toward the camera,
then at the two Pack members,
then waved his arm at the crowd.
Battleaxe shook his head and laughed.
Leonard waved again and started gesturing with his hands.
Battleaxe said something,
then nodded.

"Yo, musicians!" Battleaxe shouted.
"Quiet!  Quiet!
I said QUIET!"
It took a while for the sound to die down.
Battleaxe jumped off the table
and grabbed Peaches around the waist.

"Dost desire to be a model, m'dear?"
he asked.
She giggled.
"My friends, my friends,
our magician has another trick for us!
Says he's going to take a picture of us all tonight."

"Bullshit," someone said.

"It is not bullshit!" Leonard retorted.
"Just had to get the right chemicals.
Nobody ever thought of it before,
but I did.
I can take a picture of you all right now,"
he finished proudly.

"A picture of your king receiving his due,"
Battleaxe said smugly.
"Strike your fancy,
my fine Packie wackies?
Immortalized by my faithful court wizard?"
I could see just how thrilled the two Packers were.

"But I gotta get everybody together,"
Leonard said.
"I don't have a lot of film.
If you could, uh, just stand here,
your majesty?"

It took Leonard five minutes to get everyone crowded together
in front of the throne.
He put Battleaxe and the two Pack men in front.
Peaches went in front too,
hand on her hip and a pout on her face.
The rest of us crowded in beside them.
"Now," Leonard said,
going over to the camera that I'd helped him set up
and putting his head under the hood.
"You, you wanna move left?
No, no, my left, the other way.
Thanks.
Okay."
He pulled his head out
and picked up a flat tray.
"Gotta get some light," he explained
to no-one in particular as he
piled it up with grey powder.
Holding it high in the air with one hand
he stuck his head back under the cloth.
"Okay, everybody look right at the camera,
right here,
you too, Boney,
okay, and *smile*!

The whole world went *paff!* in an nova white shock.
It felt like two needles had been driven into my eyes.
People around me started screaming.
I fell to the floor and rolled around with my hands over my eyes
trying to make the pain go away.
Above the cries I heard a sudden CRACK!
A moment later a hand grabbed me.

"Stumpy, come on, stand up!"
Leonard whispered urgently in my ear.

"I can't see," I whimpered.

"I know.
Neither can anyone else.
Come on, let's get out of here."
He pulled me to my feet and led me stumbling
across the floor.
It took me two tries to get out of the window.

On the fire escape I could smell the city.
My head felt like it used to after my dad got finished with me,
and all I could see was purple.
"What did you do?"
I asked him.

"Flash powder," he said proudly.
"Real good flash powder.
I tried it out yesterday.
You'll be able to see in about ten minutes."

"Shit, Leonard, Battleaxe is going to kill you
for pulling a stunt like this.
*I'm* going to kill you
if I can get my hands on you."

"I'm not hanging around for Battleaxe,"
he said.
"Stumpy, I'm leaving.
I'm going to the World."

"What?"
As soon as he said it,
I knew there was nothing I could do to stop him.
"Leonard…what do you know about the World?"

"I know you can take pictures there,
real pictures,
and I know you don't have to try three times to make one stupid batch of soap,
and I know --"

"But what about me?"

I was glad I couldn't see the look on his face when he said,
"Stump—aren't you going to come to?"
I turned away from him and shook my head.

"I can't, Leonard.
I'm not some kind of scientist or genius or anything.
What would I do in the World?
I mean, except eat lots of chocolate."

"But you can't stay, Stumpy.
Battleaxe'll think you were in on this,
he'll cut you to pieces."

I stood there for a moment,
staring out at Bordertown without seeing a thing.
Then I flexed my pectorals,
then my biceps,
then turned in a slow circle,
fanning my hands in front of me
like a ninja from one of Leonard's old stories.
I grinned my best death-or-glory grin.
"Maybe honolable Batterax have suplise coming.
I'll be okay, Leonard."

We were both silent for a long moment.
"I better get going,"
he said.

"What'll you do for money?"
I asked.

He rattled something.
"I stole the stuff the Pack guys brought.
That's why the flash."

"Stole it?"
Blind or not blind,
I couldn't see anyone, from any gang,
letting go of a box holding that much silver.

"Yeah," Leonard said,
almost apologetically.
"Had to hit him with a bat to get him to let go.
Here, maybe it's lucky now."
He put the baseball bat in my hands,
then held them for a second.

"Not very subtle, Leonard-san," I laughed.
The laugh died.
"I'm kinda glad I can't see you leave.
Be careful, okay?"

"Yeah.
I'm kinda glad you can't see me too, 'cause
I look even dumber when I'm crying."
He hugged me.
I heard quick footsteps clanging down the fire escape.

"Leonard!"
I shouted.
"Take my bike!"

"I was planning to!" he shouted back.
"I figure you'll be getting Battleaxe's pretty soon anyway."

Inside the clubhouse I could hear
that pain had turned to anger.
Battleaxe's voice was louder than the others,
screaming out for Leonard.
I heard a bike roar
and a young voice cry "Wahhoooo!"
as Leonard rode off.
I smiled and wiped the tears off my face,
then turned around and waited for my eyesight to come back.
A ninja's mind is always filled by what's in front of it.
Then and there,
my mind was full of the future.

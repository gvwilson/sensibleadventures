<h2 id="prolog">Prolog</h2>
<p><em>Consider Cherne. A diamond adrift in the heavens, its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well. Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a century-long Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass, and littered the land with strange magic. When it was over the Pilots were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.</em></p>
<p><em>Now look there, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless squabbles of the Ninety-Nine Kingdoms. A girl is doing her chores. No longer a child but not yet an adult, she has no idea that her world is about to change forever...</em></p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-soldiers">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale. Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked between the twisted mountain pines.</p>
<p>&quot;Shoo.&quot; She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick. It waved its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away. Noxy cut the anchor threads of its with two practiced twists of her knife and began winding it onto a stick.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?&quot; Sensy asked, pulling a branch aside to see if another web lay beneath it.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced at her. &quot;Why? Are those ones coming loose?&quot;</p>
<p>Sensy looked down at her soft brown yakskin coat critically. &quot;No. They're just kind of plain.&quot; She sighed wistfully. &quot;Granna Fee has some really nice red ones. She said she'd give them to me if I weeded her pepper garden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her whole garden?&quot; Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder. &quot;That's a lot of work for some buttons you don't really need.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you're no help,&quot; Sensy pouted. She had spent the winter embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar. All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes and her hair and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale. Especially Rash---practically <em>anyone</em> would be more fun to be around than Rash.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes,&quot; Granna Fee had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who seemed to have taken her best friend's place.</p>
<p>&quot;Not me!&quot; Noxy had declared.</p>
<p>Granna Fee had laughed and ruffled her granddaughter's hair. &quot;No, daffodil, not you.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted, &quot;Soldiers! Soldiers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, great,&quot; she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy. The whole point of going out to collect spiderwebs that morning had been to get <em>away</em> from the younger children for a few hours.</p>
<p>Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked himself up and ran to the two girls. &quot;There's soldiers in the village!&quot; he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve. &quot;And they've been fighting! And there's a <em>tiger</em> with them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away. &quot;And there's a dragon under your bed.&quot; The pass below Stale were still blanketed in snow. Avalanches happened almost every day---someone would have to be foolish <em>and</em> desperate to be on the road this early in the spring.</p>
<p>&quot;But there <em>are</em>!&quot; Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to another with excitement. &quot;They've got swords, and some of them are bleeding! And the tiger can <em>talk</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth to say, &quot;Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?&quot; but a deep <em>doom doom</em> cut her off. She and Sensy looked at each other wide-eyed. <em>Doom doom</em>, pause. <em>Doom doom</em>, pause. It was Stale's home drum. It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed help to find their way home. It meant trouble.</p>
<p>Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch. &quot;Come on!&quot; she told Sensy, setting off at a run.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you!&quot; Young Gas shouted behind them. &quot;I told you there was---hey, wait for me!&quot;</p>
<p>Patches of ice made the path slippery underfoot, but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the ridge overlooking the village. There, in a clearing left by a long-ago lighting strike, she paused to catch her breath.</p>
<p>The ancient walls of the fortress of Stale lay below her. Rain and snow had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as the mountains themselves.</p>
<p>The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the walls like ducklings in a nest. Thin wisps of smoke rose from their slate chimneys, while vegetable plots and racks of drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.</p>
<p>To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge. A net woven from squirrel spiders' webs was stretched over its top, as light as a dream but as strong as steel. Another net hung down at the gorge's mouth to make a gate. Inside, just visible from the ridge, two gray clouds drifted half-asleep.</p>
<p>Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds, riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them. Grownups called the pair slow and lazy, but they were the most exciting things in Noxy's world---except, of course, for the herd of half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance.</p>
<p>Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her hand. &quot;Wait!&quot; she hissed, pointing into the trees. For a moment all Noxy saw was branches. Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and suddenly she could make out a hairy form in the trees.</p>
<p>Noxy's mouth went dry. She felt Sensy squeezed her hand, and squeezed back. As long as they didn't startle it...</p>
<p>Little Gas burst out of the bushes behind them and ran headlong into Noxy. &quot;Oof!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;What are you---mmph!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Noxy whispered urgently, her hand clamped over his mouth. &quot;Don't... move...&quot;</p>
<p>Before Young Gas could protest, the troll stepped into the clearing. His fur was silvered with age, and his eyes seemed as old as the mountains themselves. He and Noxy stared at each other for one long moment before he leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up into the tree. After one last look, he disappeared into the greenery.</p>
<p>Sensy was the first to speak. &quot;Wh-what's a troll doing <em>here</em>?&quot; she asked shakily, still holding Noxy's hand.</p>
<p>Noxy shook her head. &quot;Worry about that later. Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>The drum had stopped booming by the time the children reached the fortress wall. An enormous stone door stood half-open at the entrance, its iron hinges melted in some long-ago battle. The wooden gate that Stale's current human inhabitants had built to fill the gap was made of whole tree trunks, but still looked like a child's toy next to the Pilots' ancient work.</p>
<p>Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the main square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who had left a week ago to collect Stale's clouds from their wintering grounds in the high peaks. Three hundred people were there, from babies in their mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, all in an uncertain muttering half-circle.</p>
<p>A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front of them. Each one had a battle mask painted with fierce swirls of red and black pushed up on top of his head. Leather armor, as thick as bootsoles and studded with metal, protected their bodies, while heavy wool kilts reached from their waists to their knees. Some had swords in scabbards on their hips, while others had bows or spears, but each had a heavy pack on his back.</p>
<p>And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting. One man's hand was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling. None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.</p>
<p>But Noxy didn't see any of that right away. What she saw instead was the tiger. His stripes were dark brown on tan, not black on orange like the picture in the story book that three generations of village children had passed from hand to hand. A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear, and his tail twitched now and again as if the villagers' murmurs reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.</p>
<p>A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack as large as any of theirs. Four half-healed scars ran across his cheek, glistening redly against his near-black skin. His back was straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was from cold, weariness, or fear, Noxy couldn't tell.</p>
<p>Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve. &quot;Who <em>are</em> they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know. &quot;I'm trying to hear!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the square. &quot;Friends,&quot; she said in what Noxy thought of as her official voice, &quot;Friends, please. I know it is early in the year for travellers, but please greet Sergeant Dorbu and the Gifted Kulbinder.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers. The tiger merely blinked. &quot;They and their companions will be our guests for the next little while,&quot; Indy continued. &quot;I trust you will all make them welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long's a little while?&quot; Grappa Gas asked loudly. Noxy saw her mother wince. Everyone loved Grappa Gas---or nearly everyone---but as Granna Fee said, sometimes he had the manners of a constipated yak.</p>
<p>&quot;Until they are ready to travel again,&quot; Indy reassured him. Her eyes swept across the crowd. &quot;Their journey has been a hard one---they hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans. Sergeant? Would you like to say a few words?&quot;</p>
<p>The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as Indy stepped down. Like his men, his skin was black compared to the villagers' brown, and his head was fuzzy with wiry stubble. The two yellow ribbons around his sleeve were the only sign of his rank.</p>
<p>Before he could open his mouth, Grappa Gas asked, &quot;So, are you lot loyalists or rebels?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure he'll tell us if you give him a chance to speak!&quot; Heads turned as a burly man, all shoulders and scowl, pushed to the front of the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Noxy said under her breath. Grappa Gas's son Aft was the best cloudherd in Stale, at least in his own estimation. After one too many arguments over plans for the summer cloud drive, Indy had ordered him to stay behind and mend equipment instead of going with the other adults. Grappa Gas had happily taken the mayor's side, and father and son had been squabbling non-stop ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, thank you, honored,&quot; the soldier said. &quot;And thank you, people of Stale. As your mayor said, my comrades and I were trying to see if the pass was clear so that we could carry news to Chaghan. We---&quot; He paused, and for a moment Noxy could see how exhausted he was. &quot;There was an avalanche. Three days ago. It drove those of us who survived off the road into the forest. Everything seemed all right at first, but then the forest took offence and...&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Well, you can guess what happened next.&quot;</p>
<p>The villagers murmured. The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso Mountains from Uws in the south to Garheim's frigid shores in the north. It didn't hate humans the way the Jungle of Thind did, but it guarded its territory as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs. Gifted creatures that wanted to live in the forest did so on sufferance, while humans were not welcome at all, not unless they stuck to the handful of roads built long ago by the Pilots. Travellers who strayed off them were rarely given warnings, and <em>never</em> given second chances.</p>
<p>A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he continued. &quot;We finally made it back to the road, but the worst of our wounded couldn't go any further, so we left them in camp with a few of the able-bodied and came here for help.&quot; All traces of his earlier smile were gone. &quot;That was the day before last. I pray they're still all right, but if they are, they won't be for much longer.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas broke the silence that followed. &quot;So which side <em>are</em> you on?&quot; he asked, his voice still loud but a notch less rude.</p>
<p>&quot;I have the privilege of serving Respected Shudarga in this matter,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu answered calmly.</p>
<p>A handful of elders gasped at the rebel leader's name, but Aft crossed his arms and nodded approvingly. &quot;Good for you!&quot; he said firmly, his glare daring his father to disagree.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas thumped his wooden leg loudly on the cobblestones. &quot;Good for them, maybe, but what about us? If the king's men come looking for you, these walls won't keep them out for long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quiet, both of you!&quot; Indy said sharply. She was a head shorter than either of the men, but the iron in her voice left no room for argument. She nodded at the sergeant. &quot;Please, go ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>The sergeants shook his head. &quot;We didn't choose Stale for its walls, honored. We didn't really choose it at all. We just washed up here because we need help. If you're afraid that'll bring trouble, we'll understand if you send us on our way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is sending anyone away,&quot; Indy said firmly. &quot;We may not have as much as some, but we take pride in our hospitality. I'm sure we can find some spare blankets to keep you warm and something better than hardtack to feed you for as long as you need to stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, honored,&quot; the sergeant said. &quot;But what we really want is a couple of clouds so that we can go and rescue our friends.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-2-not-quite-what-we-were-expecting">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>The next five minutes were chaos. Out of the question, Grappa Gas said, whacking his wooden leg with his cane for emphasis. The king's law might overlook them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who wandered in out of the cold, but flying off to rescue their friends? Why, when the <em>tralpa</em> came back---</p>
<p>---they'd show him the gate and send him on his way, Aft cut in, arms crossed and brows knotted. The lazy good-for-nothing had run for the capital the moment word of the rebellion had reached the mountains, and hadn't been seen since. As far as Aft was concerned, he'd given up any right he ever had to tell people what the law was or wasn't. And anyway, if they were going to shelter rebels, it wouldn't matter if they'd come to Stale or Stale had gone to them. And anyway again, what would folk in other villages say if they heard that Stalers had left men in the forest to die? Saints, what would their own folk say when they got back?</p>
<p>The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones. Little whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart as people disagreed with their neighbors, or turned around to agree with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet another &quot;what if?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is going to go on forever,&quot; Noxy sighed. She and Sensy had stayed aloof on the sidelines, old enough to want to be part of the grownup discussion, but young enough that the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so stupid,&quot; Sensy agreed. &quot;I mean, they're all going to wind up doing whatever your mother wants them to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unless they get eaten by a <em>tiger</em>!&quot; The two girls shrieked and jumped as sharp fingers poked them in the ribs.</p>
<p>&quot;Rash! Don't!&quot; Sensy punched the smirking boy in the arm. &quot;I <em>hate</em> it when you sneak up on me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Rash smirked, running a thumb over the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a mustache. It had become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had told him countless times he ought to break before <em>someone</em> broke his stupid finger. &quot;But it's better than being eaten, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The tiger's not going to eat anyone, you big yak,&quot; Noxy said as scornfully as she could, her heart still racing.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know? He looks awfully hungry to me.&quot; Rash licked his lips and growled. &quot;Mmm... tasty, tasty human.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop it,&quot; Sensy said, punching his arm again. &quot;I mean it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ow.&quot; Rash rubbed his arm, looking genuinely surprised at the force of Sensy's blow. &quot;I'm just kidding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's not funny,&quot; Sensy grumbled, hugging herself. Stale's walls sheltered the square from the mountain winds, but the air was still cold.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway,&quot; Rash said, not quite rolling his eyes, &quot;What I want to know is, do we get to go on this rescue mission, or are we going to be stuck here with the littles again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we'll get to go!&quot; Noxy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Rash ran his thumb over his mustache again. &quot;Then why isn't anyone ordering us around?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth, closed it, then grunted, &quot;Wait here.&quot;</p>
<p>She strode toward the center of the square where her mother was speaking with the sergeant. The tiger sat impassively on his haunches next to them, twitching his tail at every sudden sound. The boy with the scarred face stood beside him. His face was beyond exhausted, but when his shoulders started to droop, the tiger growled quietly and he snapped to attention again.</p>
<p>Noxy's mother caught sight of her. &quot;Oh, and this is my daughter, Probably Noxious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Honored Noxious.&quot; The sergeant bowed slightly.</p>
<p>Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was immediately annoyed at herself. Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a silly lowlander custom. &quot;Just call me Noxy,&quot; she told him. &quot;<em>Amma</em>, which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on? We can go and start getting them ready while everyone's jawing.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well. &quot;Who said anything about you three going?&quot;</p>
<p>But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and had already assembled her arguments. They were definitely old enough---why, they were all going to be riding <em>real</em> clouds in a few weeks, not just tame old pair floating about in the cloud pen. And they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down the pass, and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do rescues, wasn't it? And---</p>
<p>&quot;Stop.&quot; Her mother held up a hand. &quot;You can go. But!&quot; she continued, &quot;But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna Fee, and that's all you do---ride. Understood?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded, trying and failing to suppress a triumphant grin. &quot;Yes, <em>amma</em>.&quot; As she turned to go, she heard her mother sigh and Sergeant Dorbu say, &quot;My men do that to me all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>It only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed. Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and more than a few tinkers and traders had been lifted out of a difficult spot after running into a bear or a pack of trolls. Coils of hemp rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen, and everyone kept an extra yakskin cap somewhere, just in case.</p>
<p>&quot;You look ridiculous,&quot; Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the wooden steps to the mounting platform. The older men had been teaching him how to embroider during the winter's enforced idleness, and had stitched what he claimed were eagle's wings onto the side flaps of his cap.</p>
<p>Rash looked her up and down. &quot;Really? Because I think you look amazing. Excuse me.&quot; He winked at Noxy and stepped around the pair of speechless thirteen-year-old girls to take his place on the platform.</p>
<p>&quot;Ears all!&quot; Aft called out, clapping his hands. Despite the cold, he only wore a sleeveless yakskin vest, knee-length wool shorts, and a sturdy pair of boots. His hair was braided back in a thick club with a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven through it for luck. &quot;I'm fore on Big Blue, Gas and Fee will ride spotter on Pillow. We'll down, lift, and out, quick and simple, and get our new friends back here for soup before you can sneeze. No adventures, right?&quot; He turned a steely glare toward Noxy, Sensy, and Rash, who nodded and mumbled, &quot;No adventures.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; Without any more more ceremony than that he walked to the end of the plank that jutted out from the platform, looked down to check that Big Blue was below him, and jumped.</p>
<p>Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath. One, two, three... Big Blue dimpled under Aft's weight as the burly cloudherd hit him dead center, sending gray waves rippling across the cloud's back. Aft rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly. Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in concentration as he mind-spoke to the cloud to rouse it from its morning doze.</p>
<p>Something twinged in the back of her head. She blinked, momentarily disoriented. &quot;Did you say something?&quot; she asked her friends.</p>
<p>&quot;I said, show-off,&quot; Rash replied, a note of envy in his voice. &quot;Look, he's coming up.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shook her head, the strange feeling already half-forgotten as Big Blue rose slowly toward the platform, bunching in on itself as it came. Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the cloud's back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.</p>
<p>A silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, cawing its startled displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away. Aft looked up and smiled the smile he only ever wore when he was on a cloud or had his arm around his wife. &quot;You want me to get Pillow for you?&quot; he called up to his father.</p>
<p>&quot;No need, I can---damn that boy!&quot; Grappa Gas harrumphed as Aft took three long strides across Big Blue's back and launched himself into the air again.</p>
<p>Rash whistled. &quot;Nice leap,&quot; he said appreciatively as Aft landed with an audible <em>poof!</em> right in the middle of Pillow. &quot;And blind, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not such a trick,&quot; Noxy said dismissively, though she was secretly impressed. &quot;He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, but would you trust a cloud's directions that much?&quot; Rash challenged her. &quot;Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out of what they say.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. She had realized early in their training that mind-talking was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash, or even for some of the olders who had been riding clouds for years. She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing off. The only person she shared her progress with now was Granna Fee, and even she didn't---</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em> She winced and put her hand on the back of her head. There it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?</p>
<p>This time Sensy noticed. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Noxy lied. One of the few things Aft and Grappa Gas agreed on was that cloudherds shouldn't fly if they were sick, so she wasn't going to admit to anything that might give them an excuse to leave her behind. &quot;Come on, let's go.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas made everyone wait until Big Blue was only a couple of strides below them before he let them jump on. The three teenagers had been doing it since they were little children, but the brief moment of flight and <em>poof!</em> as they landed still made them all whoop. Grappa Gas landed beside them a moment later, and Granna Fee a moment after that. &quot;Oof,&quot; she grunted, rolling over and sitting up. &quot;That's not as soft as it used to be.&quot; But then she smiled like the girl she had once been and put her arm around Noxy. Her granddaughter leaned against her the way she had so many times before, wondering when and how her grandmother had grown so small.</p>
<p>Behind them, Rash nudged Sensy with his elbow. &quot;You can lean on me if you get cold, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Sensy sniffed. &quot;I don't expect I'll ever get <em>that</em> cold.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee pressed her hand against Big Blue and closed her eyes. The cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the spiderweb gate that hung down over mouth of the gorge. As he moved away from the platform, Pillow rose to take his place. Two of Stale's other oldsters clambered aboard, too stiff or too serious to jump.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring her in closer,&quot; Indy called to Aft. &quot;A little more... a little more... Good enough! Go ahead,&quot; she said to Sergeant Dorbu. He and the two soldiers who were going with him had watched Aft's jump wide-eyed. &quot;Trust me, jumping is a lot easier than trying to pull yourself up his flank.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so, honored,&quot; the sergeant replied dubiously. He reached up to pull his battle mask down over his face, caught himself at the last moment, took a deep breath, and jumped.</p>
<p><em>Poof!</em> <em>Poof!</em> <em>Poof!</em> The three lowland soldiers his the cloud feet-first and immediately toppled over.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind yourself, he's a bit slippery,&quot; Aft said as the sergeant and his men struggled unsuccessfully to stand. &quot;Probably best if you just sit. You'll spook him if you keep tumbling about like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ready?&quot; Granna Fee called from Big Blue's back. Without waiting for an answer, she turned the cloud toward the cloud pen's gate, muttering softly as she mind-spoke her orders.</p>
<p>Back on the platform, Indy seated herself on a sturdy little stool supported by a single post. As the clouds approached the gate, she put her feet on the pedals that stuck out of the post and began pumping. With a long squeak of protest, the spiderweb gate drew back so that the clouds could get by. She paused to wave Pillow and Big Blue's riders as they drifted out of the pen and turned upwind.</p>
<p>Cloudherding is cold work. In the spring, in the mountains, when breath still fogs at mid-day and the wind pokes its fingers through every loose seam and down every collar, it's beyond freezing. A hundred heartbeats after they left the cloud pen, Granna Fee had wrapped a fleece around herself and Noxy, leaving only their faces exposed. Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy said, he might be a yak, but at least he was a <em>warm</em> yak.</p>
<p>Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected. &quot;Saints and their inventions, but I miss this,&quot; he sighed. He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden leg on so that it wouldn't poke into Big Blue, but was dressed in the same long coat and scarf that he had been wearing when the soldiers arrived. &quot;Look, the condors are back in their nest! We should invite them them to visit some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're not really the most sociable of creatures,&quot; Granna Fee said dryly.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas harrumphed. &quot;You just have to get to know them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think they'd want to meet the tiger?&quot; Noxy asked. &quot;I mean, another Gifted might...&quot; She trailed off.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's worry about today before we start making social arrangements,&quot; Granna Fee said.</p>
<p>It had taken Sergeant Dorbu and his men a day to hike up the pass to Stale Leftovers. The Staler cloudherds covered the same distance in less than an hour, even with the headwind. &quot;There,&quot; Granna Fee said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas frowned. &quot;I thought he said there were just a few of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee frowned too. &quot;Maybe 'a few' means something different to lowlanders.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren outcrop of rock that rose out of the forest like an island. Two dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire. Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw a handful of men moving about, some propped against one another to stay upright.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas gave a low whistle. &quot;Aft's not going to like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither is my daughter,&quot; Granna Fee replied darkly.</p>
<p>One of the injured soldiers spotted the clouds a moment later. The cloudherds were too far away to hear his shouts, but there was no mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms. Other soldiers crawled out of their tents and began waving and shouting as well as Aft steered Pillow in a long arc to the upwind side of the outcrop. After a few shouts back and forth, Granna Fee Gas had Big Blue hover directly above the camp.</p>
<p>&quot;You lot keep your eyes wide,&quot; Grappa Gas ordered the teenagers curtly. &quot;Forest might be happy to let us take them, or it might not.&quot;</p>
<p>Pillow descended until she bumped against the edge of the outcrop, her back level with its top. The older cloudherds riding with Aft stayed on board while he strode forward, barking orders to hurry the soldiers along. Only a few windborne words reached Noxy, but that was enough for her to know that he was telling the injured men to leave their gear, to leave their tents, to leave everything they couldn't pick up <em>right away</em>.</p>
<p>In singles and pairs, the men struggled to clamber onto Pillow's back. A few wore their battle masks, but most had tied them out of the way on the backs of their helmets. It made them look like a doll Noxy had once seen with one happy face and one sad, except the soldiers' looked fierce and weary.</p>
<p>The older cloudherds helped drag the worst of the injured onto the cloud, spacing the soldiers out to keep their weight balanced. As they were doing this, a soldier began arguing with Aft, pointing at a large tent standing a short distance away from the others. Other soldiers joined in, until Aft was facing a half-circle of angry men.</p>
<p>Finally he threw up his hands in surrender. Noxy couldn't hear what he said, but a dozen men broke away from the group and hurried as best they could toward the tent. As their comrades climbed onto Pillow, Aft made sweeping motions with his arm and pointed at the outcrop.</p>
<p>&quot;No no no,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered. &quot;You can take them all, lad, just get them loaded up and get out of there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? What's happening?&quot; Noxy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Butter-brain wants us to come in and load the rest,&quot; Grappa Gas said angrily. &quot;But look---over there!&quot;</p>
<p>Something brown moved behind the trees a dozen strides from the lower edge of the outcrop. Something else---something larger---briefly let itself be seen a few strides further away. In singles and pairs and packs, the forest was mustering its servants.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas spat over Big Blue's side. &quot;It's holding back for now,&quot; he said. &quot;But if we go in, it'll be on us like an avalanche.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not your decision to make,&quot; Granna Fee told him. &quot;Aft's riding fore on this one, and---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;---and you follow your fore. I know, I know. Saints.&quot; Grappa Gas looked like he wanted to spit again.</p>
<p>Granna Fee pressed her palm into Big Blue's back and closed her eyes. A moment later the cloud began to descend.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas looked at the three teenagers sternly. &quot;You shout as soon as you see anything, you hear me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, grappa,&quot; Sensy said with a gulp as Rash and Noxy nodded.</p>
<p>Ten heartbeats, twenty... They were level with the camp. Granna Fee halted their descent long enough for Pillow to lift off and drift out of their way. &quot;Hurry it up!&quot; Grappa Gas bellowed at the soldiers who had gone back to the large Each. They had emerged with heavy canvas-wrapped bundles over their shoulders, and were picking their way through the camp to the cloud.</p>
<p>Everything might have been all right if a cougar hadn't chosen that moment to step out of the trees. Catching sight of it, one of the soldiers snatched a branch out of the fire and waved it, shouting, &quot;Hah! Get back! Hah!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; Granna Fee breathed. Beside her, Grappa Gas swore fiercely and pulled his slingshot out of his belt. In one smooth, practiced motion he pulled its brace down, loaded it with a water-smoothed rock from his pocket, drew, aimed, and fired.</p>
<p><em>Thwack!</em> Even from thirty strides away, Noxy heard the stone strike the soldier's hand and send the branch flying. &quot;Run, man, run!&quot; Grappa Gas shouted.</p>
<p>But it was too late. The forest was awake now, awake and angry. Sensy shrieked and Grappa Gas cursed as a brown bear charged out of the trees, reared up on its hind legs, and roared a challenge. Another bear joined it, then a cougar, and then the trees were full of trolls, a dozen, two, three, a whole troop of them, hooting and shaking the branches around them until it looked like the trees were trying to pull themselves out of the ground and come after the soldiers themselves.</p>
<p>The soldiers ran, boots thudding on the stone under the weight of their bundles. The one who had picked up the burning branch stumbled at the edge of the outcrop and fell forward, his bundle hitting the ground heavily beside him. &quot;Come on come on come <em>on</em>!&quot; Grappa Gas shouted.</p>
<p>The soldier struggled to his feet, picked up his bundle, and heaved it onto the back of the cloud. &quot;Go!&quot; he commanded, throwing himself onto the cloud's flank.</p>
<p>The animals charged. Bears and cougars, a snarling wolverine, trolls on all fours with their teeth bared, all came roaring and snarling and hooting through the camp.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got him!&quot; Grappa Gas shouted to Granna Fee, diving forward to grab the man's arm as he slipped down the slippery side of the cloud. Big Blue surged upward just a stride ahead of the onrushing creatures.</p>
<p>&quot;Look out!&quot; Rash yelled, grabbing Sensy's arm and pulling her back as the cougar leaped up at them. The two teens fell together in a heap on the cloud. The cougar snarled with disappointment as it missed the edge of the cloud by a palm's width.</p>
<p>Higher, higher... Noxy let out her breath, only then realizing that she'd been holding it. &quot;That was close,&quot; she said shakily.</p>
<p>&quot;Too close. Too <em>damned</em> close!&quot; Grappa Gas rounded on the soldier he had saved. &quot;We could have been dinner, all of us, and for what?&quot; He whacked the long bundle beside the soldier with his cane.</p>
<p>The soldier surged to his feet and caught the old cloudherd's arm. &quot;Stop.&quot; His voice was as cold as ice fields beneath them.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas tried to pull his arm free, but the soldier's grip was like iron. &quot;Well that's a mess of a thank you!&quot; he said angrily.</p>
<p>The soldier released him. &quot;My apologies. And thank you.&quot; He swept his gaze across everyone on the cloud. &quot;Thank you all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmph.&quot; Grappa Gas scowled at the impassive soldier. &quot;So what was so aching important you just couldn't leave it behind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My men.&quot; The soldier nodded toward the bundle at his feet. &quot;These are the ones who didn't make it. I promised them we would give them a proper remembrance.&quot;</p>
<p>Half a dozen expressions flitted across Grappa Gas's face, leaving a look of weariness in their wake. &quot;Ah. Sorry, lad. I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier nodded. &quot;Thank you.&quot; He glanced over his shoulder, where the forest's creatures were tearing every man-made thing in the camp to pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;Not to worry, honored,&quot; one of the men beside Noxy said, his accent as burred as any cloudherd's. &quot;We'll come back in the spring and set the ghosts of the others to rest.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee's eyes popped open in shock. Grappa Gas spun to look at the man, who grinned up at him insolently. &quot;Oh, and thanks for the pull-up,&quot; he said. &quot;Mind if I take over for a bit?&quot;</p>

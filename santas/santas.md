## Episode 1: 

Once up on a time,
in a world halfway between yours and mine,
lived a young santa named Finner.
They came from a long line of santas and elves:
their mother made her first wind-up singing wombat
when she was not much bigger than a wombat herself,
while their father had started helping with deliveries
as soon as he was reliably out of diapers.<sup>
There's a story behind the word "reliably" in that sentence,
but it's best told some other time.
</sup>

Now,
Finner enjoyed elfing:
the smell of solder,
the *shick shick* of freshly-sharpened scissors,
and the pride they felt when the two halves of a dovetail joint fit perfectly together.
But sitting in a workshop made them restless.
Their mother suggested running up and down three flights of stairs over and over
to burn off the energy:
it only made them sweaty.
They tried sitting cross-legged on the floor with their eyes closed
while they hummed softly to themselves like the monks of Lotse Nuffin:<sup>
The monks were their father's favorite clients.
They wanted nothing,
so every year that's exactly what he took them,
and they were always grateful.
</sup>
all they got was a cold bum.

They tried helping with deliveries too,
and they enjoyed it just as much.
After all,
who *wouldn't* enjoy slithering down sooty chimneys
scaling the icy concrete sides of apartment buildings,
or trying to land a sleigh on a yurt without leaving a single dent in its stiff felt roof?
"Me," said the small voice in Finner's head.
"Or rather, I do, but it's not enough."

They tried to talk to their friends about it
without actually explaining the problem.
That... didn't go well.
Finner's parents were the only elf and santa in town.
There were others nearby---aunts and uncles
and second cousins twice removed
and even a few who'd married into the trade
and done quite well for themselves
despite what Finner's great-grandmother never actually said out loud at family gatherings<sup>
She was a hundred and twenty two years old,
and could not say things so loudly that no one else could hear themselves think.</sup>---but
none of children Finner went to school with or played Hide and Stay Hidden with
could ever really understand how much hard work went into making that one day special every year.

That thought made them wonder if they were lazy,
which was a synonym for "sinful" in their family,
so they tried a few experiments.
Working twice as hard made them even sweatier than running up and down stairs.
Working half as hard made their father ask if they were sick and their mother mutter about teenagers.
Neither made the yearning in their chest go away.
It grew and grew until finally,
desperately,
they realized there was only one thing left for them to do.
They would have to ask their great-grandmother for advice.

Gran-Granna Tubbly spent most of her time napping or having long philosophical conversations
with her peg-legged cat and her one-eyed parrot,
but there were stories about her.
She had been a santa---one of the greats.
She had once delivered a chocolate orange cake to a trio of scientists in a submarine
*without using a submarine herself*,
and then delivered a baby on the way home.<sup>
"Delivered" in the conventional sense of helping someone give birth.
The santas and elves in this world didn't make cunning replicas of human infants
and replace them in the dead of night while their parents were sleeping---but
we're not at that part of the story yet...

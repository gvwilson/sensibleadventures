Nardica
=======

Background
----------

*   Theme is "you can't change the past, only the future"
*   The ice has all melted, civilization has partly collapsed (very much "Windup Girl")
*   Antarctica (called "Nardica" by youngers) is rich but barren
    *   There are a few places where tweaked bacteria and worms are turning stone to mulch...
    *   ...but mostly food has to be brought in, and metal, coal, and oil are taken out
    *   The coal and oil have to be sent under guard
    *   The (mostly foreign) activists who try to destroy it are disparagingly called "druids"
    *   The fact that Nardica is making things worse is mostly joked about
*   Iffy (protagonist) lost her parents years ago in a sea fart
    *   Bubble of clathrate gas belched from the ocean bottom that sank their ship
    *   The words are a joke, the reality was anything but
    *   "Thar she blows!" (meaning "bubbles sighted") strikes fear into every sailor's heart
*   Her parents were jelly fishers
    *   Jellyfish have filled the ocean: harvested for fertilizer, and the tweaked ones for fuel
    *   One of Iffy's few possessions is a wildlife book with pictures of all the stinks (extinct creatures)
    *   Belonged to her grandmother - Iffy loves reading the notes scribbled in the margins
*   She crews on the _Guinevere_
    *   Ferry boat between Rothera and Halley
    *   Ship belongs to her Aunt Naggie and Uncle Jack (called "Union Jack")
        *   Uncle Jack is the minor villain
    *   Don't have kids of their own, which oughta make 'em love her, but it spun out the opposite way 'round
    *   Sometimes smuggles, too
*   Higher up is Governor Stern, the mayor of Rothera
    *   Ruthless, ambitious, and fearless: the major villain
    *   Reports to the British government in Hobart (England having been overrun by the Dutch)
    *   He's planning to betray Rothera to the Dutch
    *   Needs to get Major Mackles (military commander) and Dr. Jasmine Johel (political/tech) out of town
*   Iffy's love interest is Slack (in the militia)
*   In the background are the Green Zillions (the Brazilians)
    *   Eco-militants and pirates

Chapters
--------

1.  Bad Dreams
    *   Open with Iffy's nightmare about her parents' ship sinking and her improbable rescue

    *   They run a ferry between (Dutch) Halley and (British) Rothera
    *   Aunt Naggie's special curry - she gets the spice at a shop in Halley
    *   "Not that jar" (Aunt Naggie smacks Iffy's hand away when she goes to season a sandwich) - "That's for special occasions"
    *   Close with her meeting Johnson Tales dockside

2.  Taking on Freight
    *   Tales needs passage to Rothera and on to Ellsworth
    *   Comes across as possibly a con man
    *   Uncle Jack isn't interested in passengers who can't pay, but Tales has a phone
    *   "Keyed to me - some Germans seem to want to find out if it'll work with just one thumb, connected or not"
        *   "Germans? You mean Dutch?  Fancy talker..."
    *   Naggie & Jack go to get supplies, trouble shows up going boat by boat, Iffy sneaks out to get them
    *   Aunt Naggie makes a joke about Iffy being happy to get back to see her boyfriend (Uncle Jack snaps at her)

3.  To Rothera
    *   Six-day trip looking over their shoulder
    *   Comment on ever-tech: self-repairing (within limits)
    *   Motor out of the harbor, sail across the Weddell once they're in the wind
    *   Tales looks sadly at the coal engine when Uncle Jack fires it up
    *   Gives Iffy an excuse to strike up a conversation: "Why did you call them German?"
    *   Tales explains German is "Deutsch" (first sign of how old he actually is)
    *   Several times a day, Tales uses his phone to check with satellites: no sign of boil
    *   Tales sees Iffy's book
    *   Third night: Iffy has the night watch (hear Jack growl at her, Naggie try to divert him, shows family dynamics)
    *   Hears a soft ping from the phone, Tales talking
    *   Iffy scrambles back to the wheel in time for Tales to barge in: "we need to change course _now_"

4.  Pirates
    *   Iffy won't without Uncle Jack's say-so
    *   Jack comes in, bleary-eyed
    *   Tales tells them there's a ship ahead of them: "Must have been hidden in Larsen Bay"
    *   Jack asks, "What would pirates want with us?"
    *   Tales' reply: "I don't think it's pirates - I think it's the Brazilians."
    *   In amongst the South Shetlands, still under sail so that the plume won't give them away
    *   And there it is: planks of tweaked fast-growing flat bamboo, square sails on rotating masts
    *   "Oh, she's tech..." Aunt Naggie breathed reverently
    *   "She's murder if she catches us," is Uncle Jack's reply
    *   And she's definitely Green Zillions: "Ordem e Progresso" (Tales translates: "Order and Progress")
    *   "Only thing for it is get close among the rocks and fire up the coals." - Jack
    *   "I don't think that will help you," says Tales, pointing - drones
    *   Voice from the drone orders them to heave to for inspection
    *   Uncle Jack yells instructions to Aunt Naggie, Tales calmly says, "They can hear you, you know."
    *   Then he speaks Zillion to the drone - argument...
    *   Then blam! a Union fighter from Rothera blows a drone out of the sky (called in by Tales on his phone)
    *   "What kind of man are you that you can ask the Governor a favor?" asks Uncle Jack
    *   Tales smiles a bit sadly. "It's not really a favor, it's more of a down payment."

5.  The Governor
    *   "You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy." - Tales
    *   Iffy bridles.  "It ain't that bad." Tales laughs, tries to explain it's a quote.
    *   Jelly fishers with their ultra-fine nets straining goo into vats where it will be boiled down to make slurry for the gas cookers
    *   The smell was like a wall, a hammer, a punch --- like home
    *   Welcoming committee: a dozen hard men with guns and swords (which are really shock sticks - Tales' comment)
    *   And an old woman named Dr. Jasmine Johel (the Governor's chief tech, whom Tales called - was born in England itself, moved to Tasmania with the refugees)
    *   Everyone has to come: Governor wants to see you
    *   Governor: "What kind of man has a phone keyed to him?"
    *   Tales: "The kind of man who can change the world for you, sir" (sly)
    *   Secret base inland that can tap _and control_ the last few surveillance satellites - send false data to the Dutch
    *   Tales knows how to get in - "I'm older than I look" (which Dr. Johel confirms)
        *   When pressed for details, Tales shrugs: "Some kind of tweaking, I guess.  My parents didn't live long enough to tell me the details."
    *   Need to move quickly: the Dutch know something is going on (Tales had a traveling companion)
    *   Decision: sent two ships down to Ellsworth, march inland ("I'll just hike," says Tales mildly)
    *   The _Guinevere_ is to carry soldiers because it's big enough, and because the Governor doesn't know what the crew knows, and doesn't want them talking
    *   "Other choice is to make sure you can't talk"
    *   Tales will travel on another ship with Dr. Johel, who works for the Governor
    *   Her skin shifts color: she's tweaked (foreshadow Tales' tweaks)

6.  Not My Boyfriend
    *   Back at the boat, Aunt Naggie declares that she's going to make curry for dinner
    *   Only have one day to stock up, so Iffy is sent shopping
    *   Comments from shopkeepers reveal how handy and trusted she is
    *   One in particular (half-Zillion): Iffy says, "I'll fix yer solar next time, I promise, but I'm on pressing business now..."
    *   She takes time to find Slack, who's on duty in the salvage district
        *   She has a crush on him (he represents stability and family - his likes her a lot)
        *   He's intimidated by her competence and intelligence
    *   Slack spots one of the Governor's watchers following her (a person and a drone), and wonders why
    *   A few minutes later there's a call for him
    *   Iffy has to rush back to pick up the goods she's ordered
    *   The woman whose solar she was going to fix is abrupt and afraid instead of welcoming
        *   WHY?
    *   Wishes Iffy good luck (foreshadowing Zillion spies)
    *   Next morning, two ships ready to sail: the _Guinevere_ and the smaller _Bengal_
    *   Slack is one of the soldiers on the _Guinevere_
    *   Iffy: "What're you doing here?"
    *   Slack: "Following Major Mackles and some crazy man to the middle of nowhere"

7.  At Sea
    *   Plan: sail to Ellsworth, train up past Mount Tyree, drive across from the mining camp to the hidden base
    *   Down the coast past the jelly fishers and the little sonar boats out listening for bubbles
    *   Tales: clathrate bubbles feed the microorganisms the jellies eat, which is why the best jellying is where the worst bubbles are
    *   "Used to be fish here, and penguins and seals and whales.  The world shouldn't be like this..."  Meaningful scowl from Jasmine
    *   Sure enough, radio says bubbles, a Zillion ship caught
        *   Major Mackles (a gruff "Englishman" born and raised in Tasmania) orders the ships to ignore the distress call
        *   Even Uncle Jack is put off
    *   Comment about how timeless travel seems when the sun never sets
        *   And how bleak the shoreline is: patches of green where mulchers worked right next to bare rock where they didn't reach
        *   And coalers headed up to Rothera, and then in convoy westwards and then north to Australia
    *   Aunt Naggie makes curry for the high table every night, using up her stock of special curry leaves (always one in the middle of the bowl, but not for eating)
    *   And she always insists on clearing those plates and dumping that garbage
    *   A scene with Slack: awkward teenage romance, he's self-conscious because of his buddies, talk about the mission turns to talk of politics, they fight

8.  Newcastle
    *   They reach Newcastle
    *   As dirty as Rothera was smelly, dominated by the huge mulcher machines that have been idle for decades
    *   Train isn't ready: Mackles is angry, orders it cleared, local officer says, "Yes sir," but insolent
    *   Tales speculates (half-joking) that the universe is trying to stop him from getting to his destination
    *   Outburst from Mackles: everybody thinks he's a con man, but they can't take the chance he might not be
    *   Make it clear Mackles suspects the Governor's impending treason and knows why he's been sent out of town
    *   Iffy goes shopping with Aunt Naggie - conversation full of allusions with a shopkeeper
    *   Woken that "night" by shouting in the street
    *   Coup in Rothera: Governor has declared independence, recognized by the Dutch
    *   Soldiers loyal to the Governor tried to arrest Mackles and Johel
    *   Slack: "I don't know what to do" (his immediate commanding officer is on the Governor's side)
    *   Tales to Mackles: "I had a look at the train - it's ready to go"
    *   They escape to the train and roar out of Newcastle, but Slack and Tales are injured

9.  By Train
    *   Can't say they raced through the night, since it was always afternoon, but that's what it felt like
    *   Drones chase them; soldier shoots one down, the others back off
    *   Tales: "Doesn't matter: if the Germans are backing him, he'll have sats watching us"
    *   Through the Scrape to the ice (dozens of little nameless rivers on the way)
    *   Slack weakening despite some tech medicine, but Tales healing unnaturally fast
        *   Makes Iffy resent Tales
    *   Aunt Naggie tries to comfort Iffy, but throws a curry leaf out the window
    *   Iffy mentions it to Tales - Naggie's spying is revealed
    *   She rants about the Zillions being the only ones who care about the world
    *   And how happy she'll be to be rid of Uncle Jack
    *   Tales inspects the other "leaves" in her jar - asks Mackles how long 'til they reach the railhead
    *   "Here's my plan..."

10. Railhead
    *   Governor and soldiers waiting when they reach the railhead
        *   HOW DID THEY GET THERE?
    *   Tales' potential control of the satellites pushed up the Governor's timetable
        *   Governor to Tales: "The Dutch want you more than they want Rothera"
    *   Puts Tales, Mackles, and Aunt Naggie in prison
    *   Tells Johel she'll be repatriated to Australia

11. The Decision
    *   Iffy helps Johel break the trio out of prison
    *   Dr. Johel reveals that her grandmother worked with Tales
        *   She knows that what he's been doing all these years is collecting parts to rebuild whatever is really at the hidden base
    *   She says, "Finish it," then dies of wounds

12. The Battle
    *   The Zillions attack
        *   Tales and Mackles used one of Naggie's "curry leafs" to summon them
    *   Tales wakes up the mulcher
    *   Iffy finds a picture of him in the cab with other people
    *   Tales is injured again, more severely
        *   Needs Iffy's help to get to the base

13. The Machine
    *   Tales is two hundred and fifty years old
    *   Tweaked for space travel, but by the time he was grown, people weren't going into space any more
    *   Worked in Johel's grandmother's lab
    *   Not trying to control satellites: trying to send a message back in time via quantum entanglement
    *   Tales goes into the base
    *   Big explosion

14. Every Way Is North
    *   Iffy returns to Newcastle
    *   The _Guinevere_ seems so small and dirty now - Uncle Jack sitting in the stern, lost
        *   Iffy: "I'm just going to get my stuff"
        *   Uncle Jack starts to bluster, she scares him off
    *   Iffy flips through her nature book, notices a scrawl she'd never seen before
    *   "Got the same spam today as everyone else - some guy claiming he's from the future and that the world is going to melt"
    *   "Like, who doesn't know that, and anyway, what am _I_ supposed to do about it?"
    *   Iffy realizes that people can't fix the past (her parents, the world), but they _can_ make the future better
    *   Goes back to the shopkeeper that Aunt Naggie spoke to (a Zillion spy) and signs up

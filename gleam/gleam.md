## Chapter 1

Once upon a time, a girl named Gleam lived with her mother and father
in a darkness that never ended. Fires crackled and burned, but cast no
light.  Days were warm, but the sun never shone.  Nights were cool,
but the stars never twinkled. People cooked meals and mended clothes
by touch, because the dribs and drabs of light they had were too
precious to waste.

Every day, Gleam's mother and father went into the forest to gather
rain pearls. "There was a good storm last night," one or the other
would say. "I bet we'll find some by the stream."  Then they put their
hands on the path-string tied to their front door. They followed it
until it met another string, then followed that one to another. Each
time two strings joined, they felt around for the knots and beads that
told them which was which before going on.

Gleam's first memory was of her father teaching her to follow the
strings. "If you ever let go, and you don't have any light with you,
what should you do?" her father asked.

"Stay where I am and yell for help," Gleam said.  "But what if I'm so
far from the village that no-one can hear me?"

Her father hugged her.  "That's why we never go very far," he said
into her hair.

Not everyone in Gleam's village gathered rain pearls. Some trapped
songs in nets woven from spider webs.  Others tapped trees for their
sap and boiled it down to make a sweet, sticky syrup. Everyone worked
as hard as they could, every day, so that they could get some light
from Number One.

Number One came to the village every week in a creaky old wagon pulled
by four evil-tempered clankers with rusty flanks and crooked fangs.
Tattered umbrellas stuck up from the sideboards on either side of the
plank bench at the front of the wagon, and in its back were a rusty
steel drum full of light.

Number One always parked his wagon in the middle of the village. "All
right," he said each time, "Show me what you've got." The mayor lined
the villagers up. One by one they gave Number One their pearls, their
syrup, and their little wisps of song. He tossed their gifts into an
old canvas sack, then ladeled light from the rusty steel drums into
the cans, jars, and bottles they had brought.

One by one the villagers bowed their heads and said, "Thank you,
Number One." One by one they poured a few drops of light into the
mayor's emergency pail and walked home, heads bowed.

People struggled to make their light last from one of Number One's
visits to the next. They poured it out a drop at a time so that they
could cook, or fix a broken path-string, or read (though only a few
people read any more).  If someone really liked someone else, they
might put a drop of light on a flower every day to make it bloom, then
give it to them as a present.

But sometimes people ran out of light before the week was over. If
their neighbors had none to lend, they had to sit in the dark until
Number One's next visit, or go and ask the mayor for some from the
emergency pail.  When they did that, they always had to give back more
than they had borrowed.  "To make sure it will always be full," the
mayor said.  No one ever argued.

That was the only world Gleam had ever known.  But ever since she was
little, she had loved to hear Grandma Shimmer's stories of how things
had been Before.

"Again?" Grandma Shimmer pretended to sigh every time Gleam begged her
to tell the story again. "Well, all right, but then you're going
straight to bed." And this is what she said...

----

Years ago, Gleam's people had lived in a beautiful town. Light fell out
of the sky like rain, and there was color everywhere. But one night, a
wicked dragon attacked. She drove the villagers into the forest, then
somehow stole the light away. "That was the last real night there ever
was," Grandma Shimmer said, "Because you can't really have nights unless
you have days to start and end them, and there are no real days any
more."

Number One found them in the darkness. He gave them light to put up
the first path-strings, and plant their first crops of peppers and
peas.  "Whatever you do, don't wander too far from the village," he
warned them. "There are monsters out there with sharp fangs and quick
claws.  You'll be safe if you stay here."

The few brave people who ignored his advice never returned. Everyone
else learned how to find their way around in the dark, and to say,
"Thank you, Number One," at the end of every week.

Maybe it was listening to that story over and over again, or maybe
Gleam had just been born with an imagination three sizes too
big. Whatever the reason, Gleam grew up telling tall tales to anyone
who'd listen. "I heard the dragon!" he told his mother when he was
four years old. "In the trees by granna's house!"

"Oh, Gleam," his mother said. "That was just thunder."

"Papa, papa, I found some light! I found some light!" he said when he
was seven, banging the door behind him.

"What?! Where?" his father asked. His chair creaked as he stood up.

"In the forest, near granna's house. It was blue!"

"Quick, show me," his father said. He took Gleam's hand.

Gleam held back. "Well, come on," his father said. "Every bit of light
helps."

"I---I don't know if I can find it again," Gleam mumbled.

"Gleam..." his father growled.

"Shush, dear," Gleam's mother said. She put her hands on her son's
head, then on his shoulders, then knelt down in front of him. "Gleam,
did you *really* see some light in the forest by granna's?" she asked
gently.

"I think I did," he said, ashamed. "Just a little bit."

She hugged him. "Well, if it was just a little bit, it's probably gone
by now anyway, isn't it?" she said. "So why don't we just have our
peas and peppers, and then go to bed?"

And then there was his tenth birthday. "Gleam, could you please stand
up?" the teacher said. The village children were all sitting in a
semi-circle around the teacher so that they could share his light.

Gleam stood up straight and tall. "Yes, sir?" he said.

"What day is it today, everyone?" the teacher asked.

"Gleam's birthday!" everyone said together.

The teacher nodded. "That's right, it's Gleam's birthday. And what do
we do on birthdays?"

"Light enough to get home!" the children all said.

"That's right, whoever is having the birthday gets enough light to
walk all the way home. Would you like your light today, Gleam?"

"Yes please," he said.

"Really?" the teacher asked. "Do you think you need it?"

The whispering children fell silent. This wasn't how birthdays were
supposed to go.

"Sir?" Gleam asked.

"Do you think you really need that much light?" the teacher
repeated. "I mean, anyone who can escape from a clanker in the
middle of the forest without any light at all hardly needs any from
us, wouldn't you say?"

Gleam felt like his face was burning. He knew what the teacher was
talking about. "No, sir," he mumbled.

"Now, tell us, were you really chased by a clanker?" the teacher
asked.

"No, sir," he repeated, hanging his head. He heard someone snicker.
Behind him, Sparkle whispered, "Liar, liar, sat on fire."

"No, I didn't think so," the teacher said severely. "In fact, I *know*
you didn't, because Number One would never let his clankers chase
anyone. Number One takes very good care of us. He brings us our
light, and without that... Well, can you imagine how horrible life
would be without it? Can you? I can." His voice was so cold that some
of the children shivered. "So telling tales about him, or even about
his dogs, is no way to thank him, is it?"

"No, sir," Gleam said for the third time.

"All right, then," the teacher said. "You may sit down again."

Gleam sat down. The teacher drummed his fingers on the floor. "Now, who
has ten perfect M's for me?" he asked. The children passed him their
homework, so that he could check how neatly they had poked little
dimples into the maple leaves they used to practice writing. Gleam
walked home in the dark that afternoon, just as if it had been any
other day.

Months passed. The weather grew cold, then warm again. One day, when
the forest was starting to smell like spring, his mother and father
sat him down. "Gleam," his mother said, "Your father and I have
something to tell you. We're going to have another baby---you're going
to have a little brother or sister."

Gleam didn't say anything. "Gleam?" his mother said. "Is everything all
right?"

"Do I---do I get to choose?" he asked slowly.

"Choose what?" his mother asked.

"Do I get to choose whether it's a brother or a sister? Because I
think I'd like a sister."

His mother and father laughed. "No, you don't get to choose," his
mother said, hugging him. "Neither do we. But you can help us pick out
names if you want."

Spring turned into summer, summer into fall, and fall into winter.
Gleam's mother grew big and round with the baby-to-be. One day, Gleam's
father said, "Gleam, your mother's time is close. I have to stay here
with her in case the baby comes. You must take our mushrooms to the
market tomorrow for Number One. Do you think you can do that?"

"I think so," he said.

"And do you promise to be careful?" his mother asked.

"I promise," Gleam told her. He was twelve years old, and this was the
most important thing he had ever been asked to do.

He lay in bed that night, listening to the wind run its fingers
through the branches of the trees. He had only seen Number One and
his wagon a few times, but he'd heard stories about him all his
life. Some children swore that his clankers chased the ghosts of
long-lost children through the forest at night. Others said that he
never grew old, and that his skin was as hard as a rock. Gleam
shivered, and pulled his blanket tighter around himself.

## Chapter 2

"Gleam... Gleam, it's time to get up." Somehow it was morning. Gleam's
mother gently shook his shoulder. Gleam got up, pulled his hair back
into a ponytail, and put on his pants, shirt, and sandals.

Breakfast was a handful of peas and some mashed peppers, just like
always, but Gleam's careful hands found a small glass of milk on the
table as well.

"Shouldn't you have this for the baby?" Gleam asked his mother.

"The baby got some yesterday," she told him. "This glass is for you,
because it's such a special day." Gleam drank it slowly, then ran his
finger around the inside of the glass to make sure he got every last
drop.

The door opened, and Gleam's father came in. He had been sprinkling
light onto the vegetables in the garden, just as he did every
morning. "Are you ready to go?" he asked his son.

"I think so," Gleam said.

Gleam's father gave him a fat two-handled bottle, a bag full of
mushrooms, and a big hug. His mother hugged him too. "Now remember, be
careful, and keep your hand on the string," she said. "Promise?"

"I promise," Gleam said, hugging her back. He tied the bag of mushrooms
over his shoulder and set off for the village.

With the bottle in his left hand, he put his right on the path-string
tied to the house. He walked slowly so that he would not trip over
roots or fallen branches in the dark. The mushrooms wouldn't mind if
they were dropped, but he didn't want to show up in the village with
skinned knees. And he certainly didn't want to drop the bottle---as
thick as it was, it would surely shatter if it landed on a stone.

Gleam counted the knots in the path-string in his head as he
walked. One hundred fifty-one... One hundred fifty-two... Then the big
knot that meant steps ahead, then one hundred fifty-four, one hundred
fifty-five, and on and on.

The path-string led to a thick old pine tree. Gleam ran his hand over
its stringy bark until he found another string. Two square beads, and
one round: wrong one. He moved further around the tree to another
string.  Three round, one triangle: that was it. Off he went again.

Gleam reached the village a few minutes later. A few people were
already standing around a small bowl of light, swapping gossip and
vegetables.  "Tomatoes?" one woman said. "Oh, it's been *ages* since I
had a tomato---they take *so* much light."

"I know, I know," said the man beside her. "But they taste so
good. I'd be happy to let you have one if you had some cheese."

"I'm afraid I don't," the woman said, disappointed.

"I have some cheese," someone else said to her. "I'd be happy to swap
it for a spool of thread."

"A whole spool?" the woman scoffed good-naturedly. "Why, I *might*
have an arm's length I could do without..."

Gleam joined the crowd, but didn't say anything. Some of the grown-ups
looked at him curiously, but when they saw his bottle, they nodded and
went back to gossiping and bargaining.

A few people asked him how his mother was doing. "She's fine, thank
you," Gleam replied politely. It was a small village: everyone knew
that his mother's time was close.

*Bong, bong... Bong, bong...* Gleam nearly jumped out of his skin, even
though he'd heard the big bell ring every week since he'd been
born. It hung from a tree overlooking the road that led to the
village. Teenagers waited there for Number One's wagon. Whoever
spotted it first rang the bell to let the village know that he was on
his way.

As the bell rang, the schoolteacher raised his arms. "All right,
everyone, let's line up," he said in the same important voice he used
when talking to children at school. He was a tall man, with broad
shoulders and a square beard. His father had been the schoolteacher
before him, and it just seemed natural that he was the one to line
everyone up, or calculate how much light everyone owed the school and
the village's emergency supply.

Everyone quickly formed a neat line. A few people talked quietly, but
most didn't talk at all. Gleam carefully set his bottle on the ground
at his feet. Number One wasn't even in the village yet, but Gleam's
heart was already racing.

Then he heard them, panting and growling in the distance. The
clankers! Someone gasped. Goosebumps broke out on Gleam's arms.

Sure enough, Number One's wagon rolled into town a few moments later,
rattling and squeaking. It was smaller than Gleam remembered, but the
clankers seemed much, much bigger. Each time the wagon hit a bump,
flashes of light spilled from the steel drums it carried. A few drops
stuck to the umbrellas over Number One's head, fading slowly. The
sight was as breathtaking as the year-end fireworks, but frightening
instead of beautiful.

The clankers brought the wagon around in a big circle, so that when
it stopped, it was pointed back the way it had come. The dogs
immediately threw themselves down on the hard-packed earth, panting.
Number One stepped down from his seat. "Oomph," he grumbled. "All
right, let's see what you've got for me this time."

Number One was as wide as Gleam was tall, and as bald as an egg. He
wore a long-sleeved black shirt under baggy blue overalls, and black
lace-up boots that reached halfway to his knees. In his hands he held
a thick black walking stick with a handle carved in the shape of a
crow's head.

The schoolteacher stood at the head of the line and waved people
forward one by one. Number One took what each person offered,
squinted at it, and threw it into his sack with a *thud*, a *clunk*,
or a *clang*. Light glowed for a few seconds as he filled their jug or
bottle. Each time the glow came, parents looked at their children, and
teenagers who thought they were in love looked at each other. No-one
tried to bargain with him. They just said, "Thank you, Number One,"
one after another, as they always did.

Each time the line moved forward, Gleam picked up his bottle, took two
steps, then set it down again on the hard ground. He was doing this
for the dozenth time when somebody pushed in front of him.

"Hey!" said Gleam.

"Hey what?" sneered the boy who had just arrived. It was Sparkle. He
was the same age as Gleam, but almost a head taller. He and Gleam had
played together when they were little, and Gleam still had a wooden
whistle that Sparkle had given him for his eighth birthday.

But ever since Sparkle's father had disappeared in the forest, Sparkle
had turned mean. Everyone knew the story, even though it was only ever
told behind closed doors, or in whispers in the schoolyard. Sparkle's
father was drinking one night, and started complaining. It wasn't fair
that people had to work so hard for so little light, was it? "We
should just take it," he blustered. "Th' next time he's here, we
should jus' take it. 'S only one of him, an'... an'... *dozens* of
us." People tried to calm him down, but that only made him
angrier. Finally he stormed off into the darkness to "fix Number
One's wagon for good."

No one realized he was lost until the next day, when Sparkle's mother
came into the village, frantic with fear. Everyone turned out to try
to find him. They walked along the path-strings, calling his name, or
stood still and listened as hard as they could, hoping to hear him
breathe.  But no one ever heard from him again.

His father's disappearance wasn't what made Sparkle mean, though. What
made that happen was the stories the children told. The quickest way
to get a black eye in the schoolyard was to say out loud that
Sparkle's father had been eaten by Number One's clankers, or by
Number One himself. And if you said that he had run away on purpose,
and was living happily ever after in some other village, somewhere out
in the darkness, well, more than your eyes would be black and blue by
the time Sparkle was finished...

Gleam knew all about those stories, because he had started some of
them.  "What if it was the dragon?" he had whispered to a hushed group
of children one day. "She could be out there *right now*, just waiting
for any of us, and we'd never know it!" That one had earned him a
bloody nose, and three days of mending path-strings and clearing
branches from paths when the teacher found out why. Sparkle hadn't
been his friend since.

All of this flashed through Gleam's mind in an instant, but all he said
to Sparkle was, "You're not allowed to shove in like that. Go take
your place in line."

"What do you know?" Sparkle sneered. "You're just a mossie boy."

"A what?" Gleam asked.

"A mossie boy," Sparkle repeated. "All you have is moss and mushrooms.
Everybody knows Number One likes songs best. He always gives the best
light to people who bring him songs."

Just as Sparkle said 'songs', Gleam's eyes got big and
round. "Sparkle---" he whispered.

"That's *Mister* Sparkle to you, mossie boy," Sparkle replied,
crossing his arms and scowling.

Behind Sparkle a deep voice said, "Mister, is it? My, my... I didn't
know there were any other misters here."

Sparkle's mouth fell open, then closed with a gulp. Slowly, very
slowly, he uncrossed his arms and turned around.

Number One was standing right there in front of him!

## Chapter 3

Number One tapped the head of his cane slowly in the palm of his hand
as he glared at Sparkle. "Well?" he asked.

"I'm sorry, Number One," Sparkle mumbled. "I was only---"

"You were *only*," Number Oneer sneered. The head of the cane went
*smack, smack, smack* against his hand. "Mister indeed! Do you know
what I have to do to bring a little light to this measly dirt-scratch
village every week? Do you?"

The schoolteacher stepped forward with a sickly smile on his
face. "Oh, he knows, Number One. We all know, and we're all very
grateful that you---"

One of the clankers raised its head and bared its teeth, growling
deep in its throat. The schoolteacher hesitated, then stepped back,
hanging his head. Everyone else looked at the ground too, embarrassed,
afraid, or both.

Number One poked Sparkle in the chest with a stubby finger. "There
are fangsters out there, boy," he growled. "Fangsters and banshees and
dragons." He looked around. "You *do* all remember the dragon, don't
you?" he demanded.

"Yes, Number One," everyone mumbled.

Number One put out his hand and snapped his fingers. "Here. Let me
see this song you're so proud of." Sparkle handed him the little
wooden box he was carrying. Number One pulled the song out of it and
waved it in the air. A happy little melody went *fiddly-faddly-foo*.

"Well," Number One said, "That wasn't really much of a song, was it?
Was it, *mister*?"

"No, Number One," Sparkle mumbled again. Gleam could hear how close he
was to crying.

"So do you *really* think it deserves my best light?"

"No, Number One." Sparkle's voice was barely a whisper.

"Do you think it deserves any light at all?"

Gleam's stomach went cold. Somebody in line behind him whispered, "Oh,
no..."

"Here, give me that." Number One put out his hand and snapped his
fingers.

Sparkle trembled as he passed his empty can to Number One. Number
One set it on the backboard of his wagon, unscrewed its lid with a
flourish, then picked up his hose. He pressed the button on the nozzle
very gently with his thumb. A single drop of light, no bigger than a
tear, went *plonk* into the can.

Gleam's stomach went cold. A single drop of light! That was barely
enough to find a dropped fork! It would never get Sparkle and his
mother through a whole week---or their vegetable garden!

"There you go," Number One said. He screwed the cap back onto the can
and handed it back to Sparkle. "Now, what do you say?"

"Th-thank you, Number One." Sparkle was so quiet that Gleam barely
heard him. He turned around and pushed past Gleam, hugging the metal
can to his chest. No-one said a word.

"I'm very sorry about that, Number One," the schoolteacher said. "We
all are, I'm sure."

Number One glared at him for a moment before turning his cold eyes on
the crowd. "All right, who's next? I haven't got all day."

Gleam stepped forward, eyes downcast, and handed over his bag full of
mushrooms. Number One dumped them into his sack without even counting
them, then filled Gleam's two-handled bottle with light.

"Thank you, Number One," Gleam said, but Number One had already
turned to the next person in line.

The pride Gleam felt when he set out that morning had evaporated. He
had daydreamed about getting back at Sparkle for being a bully, but
not like this. This was as bad as---as---as breaking a path-string on
purpose.

A path-string... Suddenly Gleam knew what to do. He whirled around and
raced over to one of the trees on the edge of the village. A round, a
triangle, and a round... Two squares, a round, and a triangle... That
was it! He took the path-string in his hand and followed it into the
forest.

Gleam walked as quickly as he dared. "One of Number One's clankers
got loose and came after me," he said under his breath. That wouldn't
work---his father would be sure to ask in the village if anyone else
had been hurt. "The path-string was broken, so I---no, no, no." He
shook his head. That wouldn't work either.

He was still trying to think of a story to tell his parents when he
heard someone crying up ahead. He stopped, then walked forward again
slowly. "Sparkle?" Gleam asked.

Gleam heard the faint squelchy sound of someone wiping their eyes.
"What?" Sparkle snarled.

Gleam felt along the string until he found Sparkle's hand. Then he held
out the bottle his father had given him. "Here," Gleam said. "Take some
of our light. I'll tell my mother and father that I spilled it."

Sparkle might have stared at Gleam, or his jaw might have dropped in
amazement. In the dark, Gleam could not tell. All he knew was that
Sparkle said, "I don't want *your* light!" and knocked the bottle out
of Gleam's hands.

*Crack!* The bottle broke into a dozen pieces when it hit the ground.
The whole forest lit up as a week's worth of light spilled into the
air.  Gleam and Sparkle cried out together. Bats squeaked and twittered
furiously, then fell silent as the light disappeared into the sky.

"Sparkle---what have you done?" Gleam whispered.

Sparkle was speechless for a moment, as shocked as Gleam. Then he said,
"It serves you right!" and ran away down the path.

Gleam just stood there. His mind had gone blank. He could not believe
what had just happened. All of his family's light, gone---and with a
new baby about to arrive!

He was still standing there when Grandma Shimmer came hobbling up the
path. A couple of drops of light glowed inside a small glass vial that
hung around her neck on a piece of string. She carried the rest of her
week's ration in a battered old teakettle with a cork in its spout.

Grandma Shimmer stopped a few knots away from Gleam. "Who's there?" she
asked sharply. Even in the brightest light, Grandma Shimmer had a hard
time seeing.

"It's Gleam, Grandma," Gleam said.

"Was that your light these old eyes of mine saw?"

Gleam nodded. "Yes, Grandma." He stared down, where the broken bottle
lay in pieces at his feet. At first he thought Grandma Shimmer's light
was flickering. It wasn't until a single hot tear trickled down his
cheek that he realized he was crying.

"Oh, there, there, child," Grandma Shimmer clucked. She hobbled forward
and put her bony arm around Gleam's shoulders. "There, there, there."

Gleam shrugged her away and stepped back. "I'm all right," he lied. He
wiped his nose with his sleeve angrily as he felt fresh tears well up.

"What happened?" Grandma Shimmer asked.

"I---I guess I tripped," Gleam said miserably. He kicked one piece of
the broken bottle off the path, then the other.

Grandma Shimmer clucked her tongue. "Tsk tsk..." she scolded, "That's
what comes of trying to go too fast. I've always said, the faster you
go, the longer it takes you to get anywhere. And now look what's
happened! It will be a long, dark week for you. Oh, and with a new
baby on the way too, isn't that right?"

"Yes, Grandma." Gleam's voice caught in his throat.

Grandma Shimmer's tone softened again. "Oh, la, child, don't cry. Don't
cry. It's not the end of the world. We've already had that, and we're
still here, aren't we? Here, you just hold on for a tick." The
path-string went *twong* as Grandma Shimmer let go of it. Leaves rustled
as she brushed her hand through the branches over their heads. There
was a soft *pock* as she plucked an acorn, and an even softer *ploop*
as she pulled off its cap.

"Now," she muttered, patting her dress, "I *know* I had that thimble
this morning. Ah, here it is!" She pulled the cork out of the spout of
her kettle with her teeth and tilted it ever so gently. Three tiny
drops of light went *plip plip plip* into the thimble. She covered it
with her thumb while she put the cork back in the kettle, then screwed
the acorn cap onto the thimble as a lid.

"Here," she said, feeling along the string to find Gleam's hand. "You
take this, in case you need it to find your way home."

"Th-thank you, Grandma," Gleam said. She patted his shoulder, then
hobbled away, clucking her tongue and muttering under her breath. The
path-string twitched in Gleam's hand, fainter and fainter, before
finally falling still.

Gleam stood alone in the dark. He wanted to cry. He wanted to make time
go backward, or wake up and find that this whole day had been a dream,
and he was still lying in bed, and still had a chance to get
everything right. Most of all, he wanted a full bottle of light to
take home to his mother and father, not just three drops in a
thimble. But the only place to get light was from Number One's wagon,
and it was probably leaving the village at that very moment.

Number One's wagon... Wait! The drums in Number Oneer's wagon might
not be empty! Maybe Gleam could borrow some light until next week. He
would pick extra mushrooms for a whole year---for the rest of his
life, if he had to! Just so long as there was light when the new baby
arrived.

Gleam raced back to the village. The path-string flew through his
fingers so fast that it burned his skin. Even so, he was too late. The
village square was silent and empty. Number One's wagon was gone.

Faintly, far away, Gleam heard the wagon's wheels go *creak, creak* as
the clankers pulled it down the steep mountain road. "Nooo...." he
moaned. He had only missed the wagon by a minute. It wasn't fair---it
just wasn't fair!

Gleam felt like he might start crying again. Instead, he took a deep
breath and made the biggest decision of his life. He let go of the
path-string, and plunged into the forest.

## Chapter 4

Branches slapped Gleam in the face, and roots grabbed at his
ankles. One hole in the wrong place could break his leg. One stone
rolling out from under his feet could spill him over the edge of a
cliff.

Gleam knew that what he was doing was dangerous. If he got lost in the
darkness, he might never find his way home. But he and his friends had
pooled their light allowances one day and followed the road out of the
village on a dare. It snaked back and forth as it went down the
mountain. If he went straight downhill, he might be able to catch the
wagon at one of the bends.

*Phwack!* Gleam ran straight into a big pine tree! It knocked the wind
right out of him, and left sticky sap on his forehead and the palms of
his hands. He stood there for a moment with his head in his hands,
gasping for air. Little sparkles seemed to dance in the darkness.

He shook his head to clear it. As he straightened up, he saw another
flash of light. He blinked, thinking it was just another sparkle from
hitting his head. Then looked off to one side. His father had taught
him that it was easier to see faint things if you didn't look straight
at them.

His heart pounded as he waited. There! The light flashed again. It had
to be from the drums in the back of Number One's wagon. He could
still catch up! He felt his way around the tree and kept going.

The ground leveled off under his feet a few moments later. Gleam
stumbled and fell to his knees, panting. The road smelled dry and
dusty, instead of damp and crumbly like the forest. He patted the
ground in front of him until he found the ruts made by the wagon's
wheels, then crept backward into the bushes.

Light flickered off to his right. Gleam heard the wagon's wheels go
*squeak squeak*, and the clankers huff and growl as they pulled it
along. Gleam shrank deeper into the bushes. He wiped his hands on his
shirt. He would only have one chance...

The wagon rolled around the corner. Number One sat squarely in the
middle of the plank bench at the front of the wagon. He had the
clankers' reins in one hand, and a whip in the other. The tattered
umbrellas were open over his head.

The clankers yipped and growled as Number One cracked his whip
over their heads. A few drops of light splashed into the air every
time the wagon bumped over a rock or a pothole, so that the whole
scene was lit in bursts and flashes.

The wagon came closer. The clankers seemed to grow bigger by the
second. Number One cracked his whip again, so loudly that it made
Gleam jump in his hiding place.

The wagon rolled past---it was now or never! Gleam sprinted out onto
the road. Step, step, step... He grabbed hold of the wagon's tailgate
with both hands, pulled himself up, and slipped over. He had done it!
He was in Number One's wagon.

But now what? Gleam lay there as still as a moth. Even with the wagon's
rattling and squeaking, he was afraid to breathe in case Number One
heard him. He suddenly realized that he had no idea what to do next.
What if Number One *wouldn't* give him any light? How would he find
his way home? What if---what if he fed Gleam to his clankers?

Dark misgivings chased each other around inside Gleam's head as the
wagon bumped down the mountain road. He was still trying to think of
what to say first when Number One shouted, "Whoa! Whoa, you stupid
creatures!"  The wagon slowed, then stopped. The clankers fell to
the ground, wheezing and drooling.

Gleam slithered forward past the steel drums and peeked through the
wagon's sideboards. Number One propped his walking stick against the
seat, then poured some light from a jar into a chipped teacup. He set
the teacup down beside the cane, then started taking the rubies out of
his sack and putting them in his pockets.

"There, I think that's the lot of them," Number One finally muttered.

The carved crow's head on his walking stick opened its beak and cawed,
"I'll never understand why you bother with the rest of that junk."

Gleam gasped---the crow's head could talk! Then clapped his hand over
his mouth. Had Number One heard him? What would he do if he had?

"I keep telling you, there aren't enough rubies to keep them all
busy," Number One grumbled. "And if I don't keep them busy, they'll
start to think about things. No good can come of that."

"Well, you're certainly an expert on the perils of too much thinking,"
the crow's head muttered, but Number One had already stepped down
from the wagon. He walked over to the side of the road, and turned his
sack over. Mushrooms and songs fell into the ditch with soft little
*thuds* and little whistling sighs.

Gleam could hardly believe what he was seeing. His father had spent
days groping around the rotten logs where the mushrooms built their
nests!  And Number One was just throwing them all away! And
everybody's songs, too!

Number One shook the sack a couple of times to empty it, then climbed
back up to his bench. "Now," he said, picking up his cane and speaking
directly to the carved crow's head. "There's not going to be any
trouble this trip, is there?"

"Trouble?" the crow's head squawked. "Why would there be trouble?"

"Hmph," Number One snorted. "One of these days I'm going to figure
out how to open up their heads on my own. And when I do, I'm going to
toss you in the ditch with the rest of the garbage."

"And one of these days, I'm going to fly again," the crow's head
squawked back. "Would you care to wager which will come first?"

Number One snorted again. He set the cane down, then stood up and
pulled the cloth covers off the umbrellas at either end of his bench.

Gleam's eyes couldn't have gone any wider. The spokes of the umbrellas
were not made out of willow twigs, like the ones on the umbrella
Gleam's father had made for Grandma Shimmer's birthday the year
before. Instead, each spoke was a sharpened sword blade. Even in the
faint light from Number One's teacup, their edges gleamed
razor-sharp.

Number One put his hand on the spokes of one of the umbrellas and
gave it a spin. The blades went *whup*, *whup*, *whup* over his
head. He nodded and jumped down from the wagon once again. Gleam heard
him crawl underneath it. Something clanked and scraped metallically
for a moment.

A few moments later, Number One climbed back into the wagon. "That
ought to get us home," he muttered as he wiped his hands clean on the
front of his overalls. He picked up the reins and snapped them.

"Haw!" Number One shouted. "Haw, you ugly creatures, get a move on!"
The clankers leapt to their feet and pulled against their harnesses
once again. The wagon began to roll. It moved slowly at first, then
picked up speed as the clankers hit their stride. Faster and faster
it went, until it was practically flying down the hill.

As the wagon picked up speed, the umbrellas began to spin around. The
rattling and clanking underneath the wagon grew louder. Gleam realized
that Number One must have hooked a chain up to the wagon's axles. The
turning wheels were driving the umbrellas.

Faster and faster they whirled, until their blades were just a blur.
"Haw!" Number One shouted, whipping the dogs. "Haw, you ugly brutes!"
Light from the drums splashed onto the umbrellas as they raced along.
The spinning blades threw it into the forest around them, leaving
glowing spatters on the trees that faded slowly behind them

The road leveled off just as the forest ended. Gleam got to his knees
and peered over the wagon's sideboards. They were in the bottom of a
narrow valley. The road wasn't hard-packed dirt any longer. Instead,
it was covered in something hard and smooth, with a dashed yellow line
running down its middle.

The wagon's wheels made a drumming sound as they rolled over a stone
bridge. Gleam caught a single glimpse of a dry streambed beneath it,
but just at that moment, a thousand wings flapped in the air over his
head.

## Chapter 5

Gleam looked up. Hundreds of black crows had appeared out of nowhere.
They circled above the wagon like dark leaves caught up in a tornado,
then swooped down to attack, cawing furiously.

The whirling umbrella sword blades held most of them off. The few that
managed to get past threw themselves at Number One. He took the reins
in his teeth, grabbed his walking stick with one hand, and used the
other to swat the birds away. They pecked his bald head with their
sharp little beaks, and scratched his face with their sharp little
claws.  Again and again they tried to snatch the walking stick from
Number One's hand. Each time, he shook them off with a curse.

Finally Number One couldn't take it any more. He spat out the reins
and held the walking stick up so that its carved handle was just
inches below the whirling blades. "Call them off!" he shouted. "Call
them off, or I'll slice you to flinders!"

The walking stick squawked at the flock of crows. They instantly flung
themselves back into the air, cawing with disappointment. Their
flapping wings sounded like an enormous blanket being shaken out as
they disappeared into the darkness.

Just as they did so, the wagon plunged into the forest on the other
side of the dry streambed. Number One picked up the reins
again. "Whoa!" he shouted at his clankers. The wagon slowed, then
stopped. The clankers fell to the ground, gasping for air.

Number One pulled a dirty cloth out of his pocket and wiped the sweat
from his forehead. Without warning, he whacked the head of the cane
against his seat. "That... was... stupid," he said angrily, rapping
the head of the cane again in time with each word.

"Ow!" the crow's head cawed. "Stop! I command you, stop!"

"I don't... take... orders... from... you... any... more, remember?"
Number One said grimly. *Crack, crack, crack* went the crow's head,
over and over again. "And if you *ever* try a stunt like that again, I
promise, I'll dunk you in a bucket full of the brightest light I have
and let you sizzle. All right?"

"They'll get me one day," the crow's head squawked.

"Maybe," Number One said. He rapped the crow's head against the bench
one more time for good measure. "But not today." He put his
handkerchief back in his pocket, then snapped the reins. "Haw!" he
shouted. The clankers got to their feet. The wagon rolled forward
once again.

The road wound back and forth up, climbing the whole time. As the
wagon trundled upward, the air grew colder, and the trees became
smaller. Gleam hugged himself and shivered in the back of the wagon. *I
should have brought a sweater*, he thought, but that just made him
think of all the other things he should and shouldn't have done that
day.

He imagined what his mother and father would be doing at that moment.
They would know he was missing---he should have been home hours
ago. They were probably out looking for him, along with the rest of
the village.  He wondered whether Sparkle would tell anyone what had
happened, or if anyone would think to ask Grandma Shimmer if she had
seen him. Gleam felt as sorry for himself as he had walking home in the
dark on his tenth birthday.

Just at that moment something wonderful happened, something that Gleam
would remember for the rest of his life. A metal pole stood beside the
road in front of the wagon. It was smooth and slender like an
overgrown sapling, but it had only one branch, which stuck straight
out from its side.

A single piece of glass fruit hung from that branch. As the wagon came
closer, the glass started to flicker: red, orange, red, orange,
yellow, orange, yellow. The yellow light steadied, then grew brighter
and brighter, until it was the brightest thing Gleam had ever seen.

He stared up at the light as the wagon rolled beneath it. Dazzle-spots
danced in front of his eyes. It was so bright that it cast
shadows. Why, it was so bright that he could see leaves fluttering on
the trees. He could even see what color the leaves were! All that
light, just for Number One to drive past in his wagon...

Another metal pole stood by the road ahead of them. As the wagon
rolled under the first one, the glass fruit on the second one
flickered into life as well. Gleam almost forgot to breathe. The light
poured over him like warm water. He could see the dirt under his
fingernails, and the flakes of rust on the steel drums around him. He
felt like he could see everything.

But then he looked back. As the wagon rolled past the second light,
the first one started to dim: yellow, orange, yellow, orange, red,
orange, red, then black. As quietly as it had come on, it went out
again, plunging its stretch of road back into darkness. Gleam
shivered. The warmth and wonder he felt disappeared along with the
light. The air around him suddenly seemed cold again.

The wagon rolled on. The strange lights came to life and died away,
over and over again. Each one made Gleam feel even further from
home. *Would a week without light really have been that bad?* He
wondered. After all, other families got through it. And maybe the
baby-to-be would be late in coming anyway...

He was so sunk in misery that he almost didn't notice the first house
they passed. Its roof sagged over its porch, and weeds had grown up
between its front steps, but there were still shutters on its windows.
Someone had even pruned the two neat apple trees in its front yard.

They passed another house a few minutes later, then another, and
another, until house after house stood shoulder to shoulder on either
side of the road. *This must be a town,* Gleam thought excitedly. *This
must be *our* town!*

Suddenly, a loud, cheerful voice said, "Hello, Number One!" Gleam
nearly jumped out of his skin. He peeked through the sideboards of the
wagon.

Two people stood on the sidewalk, waving. They were as bald as Number
One, and wore overalls like his, but both had big, friendly smiles.

Number One ignored them. They kept waving anyway until the light
above their heads started to dim. As it faded, they put their arms
down and stood still and quiet in the dark, like statues.

More people waved at the wagon as it rolled through the town. "Hello,
Number One!" they all said. None of them were young, but none of them
seemed old, either. There were no short ones, tall ones, fat ones, or
skinny ones. Instead, they were all about the same size, as bald as
eggs, and wearing identical overalls. What was worse, they all smiled
and waved in exactly the same way. Gleam grew more uneasy with each
friendly "hello". Something was *definitely* not right...

Without warning, Number One jerked on the reins and shouted, "Whoa!"
The wagon stopped. Gleam felt a lurch as Number One climbed down from
his seat.

"What happened here?" Number One asked angrily. "Who made this mess?"
Gleam slowly raised his head so that he could see what the fuss was
about.

A bald woman stood beside a tidy little house. She had a paintbrush in
one hand, and a can of paint in the other. A wooden ladder lay on the
sidewalk beside her. A man's body was tangled up with it. He still had
his paintbrush in his hand, but his can of paint had spilled bright
blue all over the sidewalk. His eyes were open, and he was smiling,
but he was not moving. He didn't even seem to be breathing.

"We were putting a fresh coat of trim on the house," the woman said
cheerfully. "But then he fell down."

"Hmph," said Number One sourly. "Which one is he?"

"Number 20717," the woman said.

"Hmph. Him again. His brain seems to wear out every time I turn
around.  Well, put him in the back of the wagon. I'll see if I can fix
him."

The woman put her paintbrush and her paint can on the sidewalk. She
tossed the ladder out of the way with one hand, then grabbed the man's
overalls and picked him up as if he weighed no more than a pair of
socks.

The wagon creaked again as Number One climbed back into his
seat. Gleam looked around wildly. There was nowhere to hide! He was too
big to fit behind one of the steel drums, and they would make too much
noise if he tried to push two of them together. He was going to be
caught!

Gleam heard the bald woman walk around to the back of the wagon. His
heart raced. The catch on the backboard went *snick!* He tried to
swallow, but his mouth was too dry. The backboard swung down.

Gleam looked straight into the bald woman's eyes!

## Chapter 6

Gleam was frozen with fright, but the woman didn't even blink. She
heaved the man's body into the back of the wagon. *Clunk* went his
head on the floor of the wagon. He lay there like a log, a smile still
on his face.

The woman closed the backboard. "All set!" she said cheerfully.

Number One didn't look back at her. "Haw!" he shouted. The
clankers barked and strained at their harnesses. The wagon rolled
forward one more time.

Gleam sat with his knees up under his chin, trying to stay as far away
from the man's body as he could. His head was whirling. Why were
Number One and the woman treating the fallen man as if he were no
more important than a mushroom? And the woman---she must have seen
him. Why hadn't she said anything?

Despite all the thoughts that were chasing each other through his
brain, Gleam's eyelids began to droop as the wagon rolled out of
town. He was tired, and hungry, and cold, and a long, long way from
home. "Serves *you* right," he whispered silently. That's what he
should have said to Sparkle, instead of trying to fix things. It
wasn't his fault that Sparkle had called himself a mister. It wasn't
*his* fault that Number One had only given Sparkle that one little
drop of light.

Gleam shook his head. Telling himself stories about what he could have
said or should have done wasn't going to get him out of this. Still,
he wished he could just run home and tell his mother and father what
he'd seen, and let them figure out what to do about it. He shook his
head.  They would be worried sick about him. He wished he was back
home eating his dinner, or lying in bed under a pile of blankets. An
enormous pile of warm, scratchy blankets...

The sound of loose stones crunching beneath the wagon's wheels woke
Gleam up. For a moment, the splashes of light from the drums around him
made him think that he was still dreaming. Then he saw that he had
stretched out his legs while he was asleep. His foot was right in the
dead man's ear! He jerked his knees back up against his chest, then
turned over and peeked through the wagon's sideboards.

From the way the wind whistled over his head, Gleam guessed that they
had reached the top of the mountain. A dozen poles with glowing glass
bulbs like the ones in town lit the scene around them. Instead of
hard-packed earth, the wagon was rolling across a big circle of
gravel.

An enormous round building with a domed roof stood in front of them. A
thick metal log stuck out of the roof, pointing at the sky like a
raised arm. Next to the building were a dozen round tanks, each three
stories tall. A tangle of pipes connected them to each other, and to
the building. A few spare lengths of pipe lay scattered on the
ground. It was the biggest area he had ever been able to see at one
time in his whole life. For a moment, it made him feel dizzy.

Then Gleam saw how thin streamers of light sprayed out of tiny cracks
in the pipes and tanks. Thick bunches of weeds grew wherever the light
splashed. He would have said that nothing could surprise him again,
after everything he had already seen. When he realized that the tanks
were full of light, though, his jaw dropped. There was more light in
them than he thought there could be in the whole world!

The clankers pulled the wagon toward a clear spot between the
building and the storage tanks. "Lazy smelly stupid ugly creatures,"
Number One grumbled as he cracked his whip over the clankers'
backs.  Yipping and growling, they turned the wagon around to face
downhill.

The wagon creaked as Number One stepped down onto the ground. Gleam
held his breath, listening as carefully as he could. The moment he
heard the *clink chink clank* of the clankers' harnesses being
undone, he scooted on his bum to the back of the wagon and slipped
over the backboard. The rough wood scraped against his belly as he
lowered himself to the ground. He took one gentle step, then another,
wincing as the gravel crunched softly under his weight.

Three steps, four, five... He was on bare rock. As quick as a bat, he
ran the last half-dozen steps to the nearest tangle of pipes, taking
care not to kick any of the spare lengths lying on the ground, and
crouched down to hide.

Just as he did so, Number One straightened up and tossed the
clankers' harnesses into the back of the wagon. "There you go, you
stupid creatures," he said. The clankers snapped at each other,
then curled up with their snouts under their tails.

Number One took some wooden blocks that were lying on the ground and
wedged them under the wagon's wheels. *That must be to stop it from
rolling back down the mountain,* Gleam thought. He noticed that Number
One kept his walking stick tucked under his arm while he worked. He
glanced up, but there was no sign of the flock of crows that had
attacked them earlier.

Once all four blocks were in place, Number One unlatched the wagon's
backboard. He glared at the tanks in the back of the wagon for a
moment, then shrugged. "I'll empty you in the morning," he said
aloud. "Now, come here."

Number One grabbed the leg of the dead man's overalls, dragged his
body to the edge of the wagon, and slung it over his shoulder like a
sack full of moss. He trudged over to a door in the side of the round
building and pulled it open. Hard white light spilled out.

Gleam ducked his head back behind the tangle of pipes. His heart raced.
If Number One had looked back when he opened the door, he would
surely have seen Gleam's face. *Careful,* Gleam cautioned himself. Any
thoughts he'd had about asking Number One to lend him some light were
long gone.

The fallen man's head thumped against the side of the building as
Number One stepped inside. The door closed behind him with a soft
*click*.

Gleam huddled in his hiding place while the clankers worried at
itchy spots in their fur with their teeth. He was still cold and
hungry, but he was angry now, too. There was enough light in the
storage tanks around him to light up every home in the village for a
thousand years, but Number One only gave them each a cup or two at a
time! And what was more, he made them all work so hard, then threw
away the mushrooms and songs they had spent their days collecting!

For a moment, Gleam imagined himself hitching the clankers to one of
the storage tanks and dragging it all the way back the village. But
no, the tanks were far too big. Maybe he could fill the drums in the
back of the wagon, and take them home. He'd give some to his mother,
for the new baby, and some to Grandma Shimmer for her flower garden, and
even some to Sparkle, just to prove that *he* wasn't a bully.

Then Gleam shook his head. He was just one little boy. The clankers'
teeth were as big as bananas. He couldn't just hitch them to the wagon
as if they were somebody's pet moles. And then there was Number
One. He was as big and as mean as ever, and Gleam was pretty sure he
wouldn't be pleased if someone made off with his wagon. No, the most
sensible thing would be to find a bottle, fill it with light, and then
try to walk home without getting caught.

But then Gleam thought once more about the baby-to-be that his mother
was carrying. He thought about the long days his father spent on his
knees in the forest gathering mushrooms, only for Number One to throw
them away like garbage. And he wondered: why did Number One keep the
rubies, and nothing else? And then Gleam said to himself, *Well, I've
come this far...*

The clankers finally started snoring. Gleam waited a few more
minutes, then stepped over the pipe and tiptoed past the wagon to the
building.  One of the clankers snuffled in its sleep as he went
by. He froze. It licked its chops, then started to snore again. Gleam
swallowed the knot in his throat and kept going.

When Gleam reached the door, he saw that a square notch had been cut
out of one corner, so that the pipe from the storage tanks could run
into the building. Gleam turned the door handle slowly. The latch
clicked. He glanced back at the clankers nervously: yes, they were
still asleep.

Gleam opened the door and slipped inside. A little glass fruit hanging
from the ceiling gave off the hard white light Gleam had seen earlier.
The door closed behind him with a soft *click*.

## Chapter 7

Gleam found himself standing in a short hallway. The pipe ran along the
floor to an open door at its far end. He tiptoed up to the door and
sounded out the words on the dusty brass sign that hung on it: "Main
Telescope". He stepped through as quietly as he could.

"Oh..." he breathed. The inside of the building was one enormous
room. A narrow metal walkway ran around the wall. Small white lights
hung above it at regular intervals. Another walkway cut straight
across the room to the other side.

The metal log seemed to float above it all in the middle of the room.
One end stuck out through a rectangular slot in the roof. The log grew
skinnier as it got closer to the floor, like an upside-down tree. It
took Gleam a moment to realize that it was actually held between the
arms of an enormous metal "U".

*That must be the "telescope,"* Gleam thought. *I wonder what it's
 for?*

He peered over the walkway railing. A thick pipe was bolted onto the
narrow end of the telescope. It led to a pump that was as big as
Number One's wagon, and as ugly as a clanker. Spurts of light
squirted out of the pump as it whirred and clunked.

Another pipe came out of the back of the pump. It snaked across the
floor to the wall, then climbed to the walkway, where it joined the
one at Gleam's feet. *That must be how Number One fills the storage
tanks,* Gleam decided.

Even as he had the thought, Gleam spotted Number One standing at a
workbench next to the pump. The workbench had a metal top, and was
completely covered with nuts and bolts, saws, hammers, and pieces of
wood that had been carved to look like feet and ears. The crow-headed
cane lay carelessly on top of one of the piles of junk.

Gleam's eyes widened. Two---no, three---people stood motionless beside
the workbench. But: Gleam rubbed his eyes and looked again. The first
had no head. The second seemed to be missing both arms. And the third
one was the man from the back of the wagon! He stood beside the
workbench with his arms at his sides. His eyes were open, and he was
smiling, but like the others, he didn't seem to be moving a
muscle. What was going on here?

Gleam watched Number One take handfuls of rubies out of his pockets
and toss them into a battered old metal bucket. Once his pockets were
empty, he picked out a thumb-sized ruby that glistened even more
brightly than the others. He held it up level with his eyes and
measured it carefully with a metal ruler. "Hmph," he muttered. He
clipped the ruby into a small glass vise.

A metal bottle with a pointed nozzle and a trigger handle stood on the
workbench. Number One picked it up and squeezed the handle. A thin
spray of light sputtered out of the nozzle.

Number One muttered in disgust. Gleam was glad he couldn't make out
the words---he was pretty sure they were ones he wasn't supposed to
know.  Still muttering, Number One took the bottle to a faucet
sticking out of the pipe on the floor. He took the top off the bottle,
held it under the faucet, and turned the handle.

A stream of pure white light splashed and gurgled into the
bottle. When it was full, Number One shut off the faucet and screwed
its top back on. He squeezed the handle again. This time, light shot
halfway across the room. "Hmph," he muttered, sounding no more pleased
than before.  "Now, where'd I put the lens?"

Number One poked through the odds and ends piled on his workbench.
After a moment, the crow's head on his walking stick said, "Well, so
much for *real* people being too messy."

Without so much as a glance at the walking stick, Number One reached
over, picked it up, and rapped its handle hard against the edge of the
workbench. "You watch what your *little* beak says," he warned. "Or
I'll spray light all over you. You know how much you'd like *that*,
don't you?" He tossed the walking stick back on the workbench
contemptuously and went back to his poking.

A moment later he grunted, "There you are." He picked up a curved
piece of glass. Holding it a few inches away from the ruby, he pointed
the bottle's nozzle at it, then squeezed the trigger handle.

The curved lens squeezed the light that shot out into a thin,
white-hot beam. It sizzled when it hit the ruby. Shadows danced around
the room as Number One carved a thin sliver off the ruby. Even after
Number One stopped pumping, Gleam saw a dazzling bright line in front
of his eyes.

Number One set the bottle down on the floor and took the ruby from
the vise. He juggled it from hand to hand, blowing on it, before
setting it back down on the workbench. Then he picked up his cane,
holding it up so that the crow's head was looking straight into the
eyes of the man who had fallen.

"Come on, do your little trick," Number One growled.

"Only if you say 'please'," the crow's head cawed. Number One rapped
it hard on the edge of the table and held it up again.

The crow's head opened its beak and cawed a shrill little tune, *kar
koo kaw*. Without any more to-do than that, a hatch the size of Gleam's
palm popped open in the man's forehead.

Gleam watched in amazement as Number One pried a small piece of stone
out of the man's head. It was the same size and shape as the ruby that
Number One had just cut, but instead of glittering and gleaming, it
was as dull as an old brick.

"Well, that one didn't last long," Number One muttered, tossing it
onto the floor. He took the carved ruby from the workbench and pushed
it into the empty slot in the man's head.

Gleam heard a faint *click*. Nothing happened. Number One drummed his
fingers on the workbench impatiently, then slapped the man's cheek,
*whack whack*. "Come on, you stupid robot. Wake up, wake up."

The man twitched. He blinked his eyes. "Why, hello, Number One!" he
said brightly. "I must be in your workshop! It is wonderful to be
back!  Why, I---"

Number One hastily plucked the ruby out of the man's head. It stopped
speaking instantly.

Number One weighed the little gem in his hand. "Hmph," he grunted.
"Sounds like that one would make you almost as smart as me. And we
can't have that, can we?"

"You might even need it yourself one day," the crow's head squawked.
"Yours can't last forever, you know."

"Shut your beak," Number One said absently. He squinted at the ruby,
then shrugged and set it down on his workbench.

Number One pulled another ruby out of the bucket. This one didn't
shine nearly as brightly as the first one. He pushed it into the man's
head, then rapped his knuckles on the man's nose as if he was knocking
on a door.

The man blinked once again. "H-h-hello M-m-mister F-f-f-" he
stuttered.

Number One thumped the man's chest. "-ing!" he finished. "Robot
number t-t-two oh seven one seven, reporting f-f-for work."

"So, what happened to you, you clumsy oaf?" Number One asked roughly.

"I was p-p-painting!" the robot said happily. "I l-l-love to p-p-p---
I love to p-p-p--- I love to p-p-p---!"

Number One growled. He pulled the second ruby out of the robot's head
and tossed it back into the bucket. Grumbling to himself, he walked
over to the other side of the room, opened a door, and stepped out.

Gleam watched him leave. His head felt like it was *really* spinning
now.  It was bad enough that Number One was hoarding all that
light---and throwing away the mushrooms and songs that the villagers
gave him. But this! People with---no, not people. What had it called
itself? A robot? A robot with a ruby for a brain, and... and... and
who knew what else? Gleam had to get back to the village and tell them
everything he had seen.

But would they believe him? He only half believed it himself. He
needed some kind of proof.

The rubies! He could take some of the rubies! That would convince
everyone. And the bottle of light with the squeeze handle, too, so
that he could find his way home. *It wouldn't really be stealing,*
Gleam told himself. *Not bad stealing, anyway.*

A rickety metal ladder ran from the walkway that spanned the room to
the floor below. Gleam crept forward, afraid that Number One might be
back at any moment, then scrambled down it. His feet went *chung chung
chung* on the rungs. "Sh..." he whispered to himself. He scurried over
to the workbench.

Just as he reached out to pick up the ruby that was lying there, a
rasping voice said, "What are you doing, you stupid mammal? He'll see
right away that it's missing!"

## Chapter 8

Gleam jumped with fright. He had forgotten about Number One's walking
stick! It was still lying on the workbench.

"I---I---" Gleam stammered.

"Wonderful," the crow's head cawed sarcastically. "Someone *finally*
comes to rescue me, and all he can think about is pretty little
gew-gaws. You're worse than my crows!"

"I'm sorry," Gleam said. "I just need something to show to everyone
back in the village. They'll never believe I was here otherwise."

The crow's head glared at him. "Well then, go ahead," it told
Gleam. "He probably won't notice for months anyway. He's as thick as
you furry nuisances."

Gleam hesitated. He could only carry a few rubies in his pockets. He
took a rag from the workbench, then knelt beside the pail and began
scooping rubies onto the rag.

"So, was that you in the back of the wagon?" the crow's head asked.

"You knew I was there?"

"Of course," the crow's head cawed. "Number One might be too
chalk-headed to notice, but my crows spotted you when we were on the
bridge. You were *supposed* to rescue me while they distracted him."

"I'm sorry," Gleam said again. "I didn't know you needed rescuing."

"Of course I need rescuing!" the crow's head squawked indignantly. "Do
you think I *like* being knocked around whenever Number One feels
grumpy?"

"I suppose not," Gleam said. He tied the rag's corners together to make
a bag, then stood up.

"Well, there's no supposing about it," the crow's head squawked. "Now,
can you see in the dark? No? Oh, mammals... You're useless. All right.
Take the spray bottle, too. He'll probably spend a week looking for
it."

Gleam picked up the bottle of light and turned to go. He found himself
looking straight into the robot's empty eyes. He hesitated again, then
put the can of light and the rag-bag full of rubies on the workbench.

"What are you doing?!" the crow's head squawked as Gleam picked up the
first ruby that Number One had put in the robot's head. "You're
wasting time! Number One could be back any second!"

Gleam ignored the harsh voice. He stood on the very tips of his toes,
set the carved ruby into the slot that his fingers found, and closed
the hatch.

*Click.* The robot blinked. "Good morning, Mister---hey, you're not
Number One!" it said.

"No, I'm not," Gleam said. "I'm... I'm... I'm his assistant!"

The robot blinked, then smiled and stuck out its hand. "I'm very
pleased to meet you! I'm Number 20717, at your service!"

Gleam grinned and shook the robot's hand. "I'm very pleased to meet you
too, Number 20717. I hope you're feeling better now."

"Oh yes, much better! Why, I feel like my brain is practically
sizzling!  Is it a new one?"

"Yes, it's brand new," Gleam told it.

"Well then, I should get back to work!" the robot said. "I *love*
working!" It gave Gleam's hand one last shake, then walked away
briskly, its arms swinging.

Gleam watched it go with a grin. "You *idiot!*" the crow's head hissed.
"What did you do that for?"

Gleam shrugged, still grinning. "I felt sorry for him," he said. "All
Number One gave him was a dull, chipped old ruby."

"Sorry? Sorry?" the crow's head squawked. "How about feeling sorry for
me? How about feeling sorry that I'm stuck in this thing instead of in
my real body?"

"Your *real* body?" Gleam asked.

"Of course my real body," the crow spluttered indignantly. "This stick
is only supposed to be for temporary storage, but oh, someone got
clever, didn't he? Oh yes, and someone's going to be very, very sorry,
I can promise you that. Now, quick! Take me outside and put me back
where I belong, and I'll let you have half of the light in the storage
tanks!"

"What? I don't want half of the light," Gleam protested.

"Oh, come on," the crow's head scoffed. "All you mammals want light."

"But it belongs to everyone!"

"All right, then share it with them if you want," the crow's head
squawked frantically. "Just get me out of this thing!"

Gleam nodded. "All right." He reached for the cane. Just as he did so,
Number One bellowed, "What are *you* doing here!?"

Gleam whirled around. Number One was standing in the doorway on the
other side of the room with a mismatched pair of legs in his arms. He
dropped them on the floor and grabbed an enormous sledgehammer.

Gleam took three steps toward the ladder. Wait! The light! And the
rubies! He spun around and grabbed the bottle and his rag-bag. As he
turned around again, the knot in the rag came undone. Sparkling red
stones clattered onto the floor.

Gleam didn't stop to pick them up. He ran to the ladder and scrambled
up as quickly as a squirrel. Behind him, the crow's head squawked,
"Thief!  Thief! Oh, I tried to stop him, honest I did!" as Number One
yelled, "Stop! Stop, or I'll put the clankers on you!"

Gleam's feet went *clonk, clonk, clonk* on the walkway as he ran to the
exit. Number One bellowed once more behind him as the crow's head
squawked and cawed.

Gleam ran across the walkway, through the door, and down the hall. He
stopped at the outside door, panting.

Heavy feet clonked on the metal ladder behind him. He turned the door
handle as gently as he could and peeked outside. The clankers were
still snoring on the ground beside the wagon. He heard Number One
shout again behind him. One of the clankers snuffled and growled in
its sleep. Gleam would have to move fast!

He slipped through the door and ran to the wagon. It only took him a
moment to kick away the blocks Number One had put against its wheels.
He ran to the back of the wagon and pushed. It didn't budge. Faintly,
he heard Number One bellow again inside the observatory. Another
clanker twitched its ears.

Gleam put his shoulder against the wagon and pushed even harder. "Come
on, come on!" he whimpered. His feet slipped. He dug in and pushed
with all his might. His feet slipped again on the gravel. He fell to
one knee.

"Come *on*," he whispered frantically. He stood up and put his whole
weight against the wagon.

The wagon moved an inch, then stopped and rolled back. Gleam pushed
again. The wagon rolled a little further. He rocked it back and forth.
Once, twice, three times...

The wagon rolled forward instead of slipping back. Gravel crunched
under its wheels. Gleam kept pushing. His feet slipped again, but this
time he didn't fall.

Suddenly the wagon's wheels were off the gravel and on the road. It
picked up speed as the incline tugged at it. Slowly, too slowly, then
faster, until Gleam was jogging to keep up, faster and faster and---

The door burst open behind him with a crash. "Wake up you stupid lazy
ugly warty drooling smelly things and *get him!*" Number One roared.

Gleam gave the wagon one last push, then scrambled up over the
backboard.  He glanced back to see the clankers surge to their
feet. They snuffled at the ground, trying to pick up a scent. A moment
later one of them yelped. "Yes, yes, go, go!" Number One shouted,
kicking the nearest clanker in the rump. The clankers scrambled
over one another and raced after the wagon.

"Uh oh," Gleam said out loud. He squeezed between the steel drums and
hopped onto the front seat, then twisted around to look back
again. The clankers were getting closer. He slapped the seat with
his hand as if that would make the wagon go faster. "Come on!" he told
it. "Come on!"

The wagon was rolling faster now, but the clankers were still
gaining ground. They yelped and howled as they narrowed the gap an
inch at a time. Their fangs gleamed in the dregs of light that
spittered and spattered from drums of light behind Gleam.

But then the road tilted over the mountain's shoulder. The wagon
picked up speed. The clankers started to fall behind. They howled
with disappointment as the wagon pulled away from them.

"Woo hoo!" Gleam shouted as the wagon went faster and faster down the
narrow road, a steep cliff on one side, an old wooden railing on the
other. The wind blew through his hair. He had never gone so fast in
his life. He'd done it! He'd really done it!

*Bang!* The wagon hit a bump. Gleam was nearly thrown off the seat.
"Whoa!" he exclaimed. He put the bottle of light between his knees and
grabbed hold of the bench with both hands.

*Thump!* The wagon hit another bump in the road so hard that it
bounced up onto two wheels. Gleam twisted around to keep his
balance. As he did so, his elbow hit the bottle's squeeze
handle. Light sprayed onto his face, into his hair, and right up his
nose.

"Achoo!" Gleam sneezed a big, bright, rainbow-colored sneeze down the
front of his shirt. The bottle slipped out from between his knees and
fell over the side of the wagon. The clankers howled as it went
*clink, clank, clonk* on the road behind him.

The wagon thumped back onto all four wheels. Little speckles of light
danced in front of him, even as the gooey glow on his shirt began to
fade. Gleam wiped the light from his eyes with his sleeve and blinked.

There, right in front of him, the road bent sharply to the right.
"Whoa!" he shouted again. He leaned over to one side, but the wagon
kept going straight. It wasn't going to turn! It was going to---

*CRASH!* The wagon burst through the railing and went straight over
the side of the cliff!

## Chapter 9

The wagon hurtled through the air. Gleam screamed in terror. The
clankers howled with disappointment behind him. The wind whistled
past his ears---except it was really his ears whistling past the
air. All he could think was, *Now I'll never get to meet the new
baby.*

Hundreds of small wings suddenly fluttered over Gleam's head. Dozens of
sharp claws dug into his shoulders. It was the crows! They had caught
him in mid-air!

The black birds squawked and cawed as they lifted Gleam into the
air. He screamed again as the wagon fell away beneath him. It tumbled
end over end through the air. It smashed into the ground a hundred
feet below.  *FLASH!* The drums of light burst, spilling their last
dregs of light into the sky. Wagon wheels and broken boards bounced
down the mountainside, *clunk, bonk, kerthump*.

Gleam hung in the darkness, kicking at the nothingness under his
feet. If it hadn't been for the sharp claws digging into his shoulders
and arms, he would have thought he was dreaming. The only sound was
the flapping of the crows' wings as they struggled with his weight.

Something hit Gleam's left foot, then scraped along his shin. A branch!
The crows dropped Gleam into a tree by the side of the road. He
clutched at it to stop himself from falling to the ground. The
branches scratched his face and arms, but he didn't care. His heart
was beating so fast that it kicked in his chest like a baby rabbit.

All of a sudden Gleam heard snuffling and growling below. The
clankers' claws went *clack, clack, clack* on the road as they
trotted toward his tree. They whuffled and whined as they sniffed at
the broken railing.

Gleam held his breath and clung to his tree. He felt it tremble. For a
moment he thought that even the tree was afraid of the
clankers. Then he realized that *he* was the one who was shaking.

Gleam didn't move when the clankers turned and ran back up the road.
He didn't move when he could no longer hear their claws. He didn't
even move once he could no longer hear them growling. Instead, he
waited for his arms and legs to stop shaking. Only then did he climb
slowly down to the ground and sit in the dark with his back against
the tree.

Without warning, hot tears welled up in his eyes. His fingers dug into
the dry earth at the base of the tree. He screwed up his face, but a
single sob escaped him, then another. It wasn't fair---he'd only been
trying to make things right for Sparkle. He didn't want to be here,
miles away from home, chased by hungry clankers, nearly falling off
the side of a mountain, stuck in the dark with no light, no friends,
and no idea what to do next. He just wanted to go home. His mother and
father would be so worried...

"I just want to go home," he whispered wretchedly. "Please,
somebody..."  He dug his fingers deeper into the earth, and kicked his
heels against the ground a couple of times, wishing that he could just
snap his fingers and whistle like the magicians in his father's
bed-time stories.

Gleam shook his head angrily and wiped the tears off his cheeks. There
weren't any magicians in the world, not really. And crying wasn't
going to help---no-one could hear it, and no-one was going to appear
out of nowhere and set things right for him. He was on his
own. Whatever happened next was up to him.

He took a shaky breath and let it out with a whoosh. Slowly,
carefully, he began to empty out his pockets. Two halves of a broken
shoestring: they wouldn't be much help. A pebble that was smooth on
one side, and rough on the other: he was going to give it to the new
baby as a present, but his mother said no. "The baby might swallow
it," she explained, so Gleam decided to keep it for himself.

And---he froze. He had the thimble that Grandma Shimmer had given
him. He ran his thumb over it very gently. The acorn cap was still in
place.  There might still be some light inside!

His heart sank. Grandma Shimmer had only given him three drops. They
wouldn't get him very far. If only he hadn't dropped the bottle from
Number One's workshop. There was plenty of light in it...

Gleam frowned. The wagon had been moving so fast when he dropped it
that it could have bounced almost anywhere. *But then it would roll
downhill,* he thought. He stood up carefully with the thimble of light
in his fist, then walked slowly down the road until he felt it level
off. "Please, please, please," he whispered. He raised the thimble up
as high as he could and pulled off its acorn cap.

*Plip.* The first drop of light fell from the thimble. Gleam looked
around wildly. Nothing!

*Plip.* The second drop of light sparked and faded away. He couldn't
see it! He couldn't see the bottle!

*Plip.* Nothing! No, wait---over there! There it was, just a few feet
away from him, caught against the railing on the side of the road!

"Thank you, Grandma," he breathed. He put the thimble back in his
pocket, walked carefully over to where he had seen the bottle, and
knelt down.  He patted the ground, lightly, carefully, until his
fingers brushed against it. It was solid and heavy in his hands he
picked it up.

Gleam heaved a big sigh of relief and hugged the bottle to his chest.
Suddenly he was grinning. He'd done it! He spun around and sprayed a
little light into the sky.

He froze. Hundreds of crows covered the branches of the trees around
him like black snowflakes. Their beady black eyes glittered briefly in
the light.

Gleam gulped. "I guess the crow's head told you to save me," he said
uncertainly. "Can---can you talk?" The crows didn't answer.

Gleam frowned. On the one hand, he knew where Number One's light came
from, and he hadn't been eaten alive by clankers. On the other
hand, he was a long way from home, and Number One's wagon was
wrecked. It wouldn't ever bring any light to the village again. And it
was all Gleam's fault...

He sighed. His father always said that the best time to do something
you really didn't want to do was yesterday. If it was too late to do
it then, you might as well do it right away. He began trudging wearily
down the mountain, spraying a little light in front of himself now and
again so that he could see the way.

Gleam barely glanced up when the first glass bulb came to life over his
head. All he thought was, *Well, that'll save me using some of mine.*
He didn't look up at all for the second light, or the third, or the
ones after that. After everything he had seen that day, they didn't
seem nearly as wonderful any more.

He was underneath the thirteenth light when he saw a robot sweeping
the sidewalk in front of him. It stopped and raised its arm. "Hello,
Mister..." it began in a cheerful voice. It never finished its
greeting.  Instead, its voice trailed off. It lowered its arm slowly.

"Hello yourself," Gleam muttered. The robot stared at him as he walked
by. Lost in his own thoughts, Gleam didn't pay it any attention until
he heard its heavy footsteps behind him. The robot was following him!
A cold chill ran down his spine. He picked up his pace, but did not
turn around.

Soon Gleam was walking past other robots. Some opened their mouths, but
did not speak. Some did not even wave. One by one they put down
whatever they were doing to follow him. As he trudged along, they
started whispering behind him. "Stranger... A stranger... He's not one
of us... *He's* not supposed to be here..."

The whispering grew louder as he approached the center of town. He
stopped short when he reached the main square. A crowd of robots was
already there, waiting for him. "Stranger... Stranger..." they
whispered menacingly. He was surrounded!

## Chapter 10 ----------

Gleam looked around wildly. Robots blocked every exit. There was
nowhere for him to run. "Stranger... stranger..." they
whispered. Their bald heads and fixed smiles seemed as frightening as
the clankers' fangs and claws.

"Don't let them know you are afraid," he whispered under his
breath. It was what his father said the first time he came home in
tears after being bullied by Sparkle. "Don't let him know you're
afraid, and he'll leave you alone. If you act brave, he'll think
you're brave, and then you'll think you're brave too."

Gleam squared his shoulders and walked toward the fountain in the
middle of the square as if no-one else was
there. "Stranger... stranger..." the robots whispered. Gleam started
whistling to drown them out. He swung the can of light as he walked.

The robots shuffled closer and closer around him. "*He's* not supposed
to be here," said a voice. "*He's* not one of us," said another.

Gleam kept whistling. Just as he reached the edge of the fountain, a
louder voice said, "Hey!"

Gleam whirled around---and bumped into the edge of the shallow pool
that surrounded the fountain. "Whoa!" he exclaimed. *Splash!* Over the
edge he went, right into the cold water.

He spluttered back to his feet, the bottle of light still in his hand.
Robot #20717 was standing right there in front of him.

"Why, he isn't a stranger!" the robot said. "He's Number One's
assistant!"

The other robots instantly stopped whispering. "Hello, Number One's
assistant!" they said in unison.

"Um, hello," Gleam said. He set the bottle of light down on the edge of
the fountain and wiped the water from his face. The robots were all
smiling now, but none as broadly as #20717.

"Thank you for giving me such a wonderful new brain," it said to Gleam.
"I've been having all kinds of new thoughts since you put it in."

"Um, you're welcome." Gleam's sandals squelched on the pavement as he
stepped out of the fountain pool. His wet shirt and pants felt cold
against his skin.

"Do you have some new jobs for us to do?" #20717 asked eagerly. "Is
that why Number One sent you?"

"Number One didn't send me," Gleam said without thinking. The robots
around him instantly stopped smiling. *Whoops,* Gleam thought. *That
wasn't the right thing to say.*

#20717 frowned. "But... if Number One didn't send you, why are you
here?" it asked slowly.

"Um...it's a surprise!" Gleam replied quickly.

#20717's frown deepened. "Number One doesn't like surprises."

"He'll like this one," Gleam told it confidently. He forced a smile
onto his face. "But for now, everyone should get back to work."

The moment he said the word 'work', all the robots turned and started
to walk away. "And don't say anything to Number One about seeing me!"
Gleam called after them. "That would spoil the surprise for sure!"

As they walked away, Gleam picked up his bottle and trotted after
#20717. "Hey!" he said. "Two oh seven one seven!"

The robot turned around. "Yes, Number One's assistant?" it said once
again. "Can I help you?"

"I hope so," Gleam said. "I, uh, I need someone to help me organize
Number One's surprise, but it has to be someone really, really smart.
Do you think your new brain is up to it?"

"Yes, thank you, my new brain is excellent!" the robot said proudly.
"It's so excellent, I can even use words like 'excellent' properly!"

Gleam smiled at that. "All right. But I still have to test you. Here's
the first question: how long have you been here?"

"Fourteen and a half seconds," the robot replied promptly.

Gleam stared at it, then laughed and shook his head. "No, no, I don't
mean right *here*, I mean how long have you been living in this town?"

"For years and years, I think," the robot said. "But I don't remember
exactly. My brain has been replaced several times. I don't have all of
my memories."

"That's all right," Gleam said. "Now, here's the second question: do
you know where you came from? Not just a few seconds ago," he added
hastily as the robot opened its mouth to answer. "I mean years and
years ago. Do you know how you got here? Or where you were before?"

The robot was silent for a long moment. "It was...dark," it said
slowly.  "I remember that it was dark, and we were all together,
waiting. But then Number One saved us."

"Saved you from what?" Gleam asked.

"From the monsters," the robot whispered. "Out there, where Number
One goes. If he didn't take them some light every week, they would
strip us down for spare parts, and take out our brains, and never,
ever let us work again." It shivered. "He's very brave."

"What?" Gleam exclaimed. "That's not---he doesn't give the light to any
monsters! He gives it to us! And he makes us work and work for it!"

As soon as he said it, Gleam realized he'd made a mistake. The robot
frowned. "What do you mean, 'us'?" it asked slowly. Then its frown
deepened. "Unless... unless *you're* one of the monsters!"

"Oh, no," Gleam said in his friendliest voice (even though his heart
was racing). He spread his arms. "Do I *look* like a monster?"

"I don't know," the robot said suspiciously. "What do monsters look
like?"

Gleam forced himself to laugh. "Well, for a start, they're a lot bigger
than me."

"Not the little flying ones," the robot said, still suspicious. "They
spy on us all the time. We have special orders to swat them with our
rakes and our brooms whenever we can."

"You mean the crows?"

"Shhh!" The robot looked around. "We're not supposed to use that word.
Number One was *very* clear about that."

"All right. But what about the other monsters? Have you ever seen
them?"

The robot shook its head. "No, I haven't. Have you?"

Gleam took a deep breath. "No. And do you know what? I don't think
they're real. I think Number One just made them up."

The robot's eyes widened. Its jaw dropped. Then it smiled and said,
"Ha ha ha!" just like that---not a real laugh at all, just, "Ha ha
ha!"

"Why are you laughing?" Gleam said crossly. "I'm serious! I think
Number One made up all that stuff about monsters, just to scare
everybody."

"Made it all up?" the robot gasped. "Not Number One! Why, we would
all be lost without him! Who would tell us which houses to paint? Or
when to sweep the leaves off the streets! Who would we say 'hello'
to?"

"I think he made it aaaallll up," Gleam repeated firmly. "And I can
prove it, too."

"How?" the robot asked.

"First, we'll need to get some more light," Gleam said. "Lots more
light, because we'll have to walk a long way."

"Where are we going?"

"Down the mountain," Gleam said. "And then there's a bridge, and then
we go back up the mountain on the other side."

"And then what?" the robot asked in a hushed voice.

"And then I'll show you that there aren't any monsters out there,"
Gleam said. "There's just people like me."

"I can't just go," the robot protested. "I'm supposed to be painting."

"But if you don't come with me, you'll never find out whether there
really are any monsters," Gleam pointed out.

The robot hesitated. *Come on, give in,* Gleam pleaded silently. *I
know you're curious---I just know you are.*

"All right," the robot finally said. "I know where the light for the
streetlights is. We can get some of that."

"What's a streetlight?" Gleam asked.

The robot pointed. "The big lights up there. Don't you have them where
you come from?"

"We don't have lights like that at all," Gleam said. "There isn't
enough light in the whole village for one of those."

The robot showed Gleam a storage tank tucked behind a building on the
side of the square. Gleam topped up his bottle, while the robot filled
a square-sided can that lay on the grass nearby.

"Well, I guess we're set," Gleam said. He was terribly hungry, but
somehow didn't think that he'd like whatever robots ate---if they ate
at all.

They set off down the road together. Gleam felt as if he ought to be
talking to the robot, but he couldn't think of anything to say. The
robot still had a frown on its face. It seemed to be thinking about
what Gleam had told it.

Suddenly the robot stopped. "I just had an idea," it said.

"What?" Gleam asked.

"What if I carried you? We could go a lot faster."

"Wouldn't I be too heavy for you?" Gleam asked.

"I don't think so," the robot said. As quick as a bee, the robot
picked him up and slung him over its shoulder like a sack full of
moss. "Why, you hardly weight anything!" the robot said.

"Put me down!" Gleam exclaimed. The robot dumped him on the ground.

"What's the matter?" the robot asked.

Gleam stood up, rubbing his elbow where it had hit the pavement. "That
hurt," Gleam told it angrily.

"What is... 'hurt'?" the robot asked.

Gleam stared at it, then sighed and shook his head. "Never mind. But
there's a better way for you to carry me. Turn around. Good. Now put
your arms out---no, not like that, just at your sides, but with a bit
of space. Ready? One... two... three!"

Gleam jumped up onto the robot's back and put his arms around its neck
so that he was riding piggy-back.

"Is this right?" the robot asked.

"That's great," Gleam said. He wriggled a bit so that his legs were
tucked right in against the robot. "Now, can you pick up the light?"
The robot bent its knees, grabbed the bottle and the can, then
straightened up again. "Good! Now, let's go!" The robot took a step,
then another, then leaned forward and ran down the winding mountain
road.

## Chapter 11 ----------

Gleam quickly discovered that piggy-backing on a robot was a lot
bumpier than lying in the back of Number One's wagon. Up close, it
was easy to tell that the robot wasn't a real person. His hair smelled
like machine oil, and his muscles were as hard as wood. *It's not like
riding on my father's back at all*, Gleam thought. He had done that
when he was little, as a special treat. His father would feel his way
along the path string with Gleam's arms around his neck as they counted
out the knots together.

After a while, Gleam's shoulders started to ache. The ache grew and
grew, until his arms felt like they were being jolted out of their
sockets, but he kept holding on.

The robot didn't seem to get tired. Every hundred steps or so Gleam
sprayed a few drops of light into the air in front of them. The robot
seemed to memorize everything it saw in a single glance, so that most
of their journey was in darkness.

They wound their way down to the bottom of the mountain. As the road
leveled off, and they came out of the forest, Gleam held his breath,
listening for the crows' wings. All he heard was the *thomp thomp
thomp* of the robot's feet.

*Thomp thomp thomp*, and then a hollow *plunt plunt plunt* as they
crossed the stone bridge over the dry streambed. Gleam's heart skipped
a beat. They were halfway home! For a moment he forgot about the
gnawing, grumbling emptiness in his stomach, the ache in his
shoulders, and the bruises that were slowly forming on his legs where
the robot's arms gripped him. He was halfway back to the village, and
to his mother and father.

The road began to climb. Gleam sprayed light more frequently as they
wound back and forth up the mountain. His excitement grew with each
turn in the road as he thought about all the things he had
discovered. He imagined himself standing on a crate in the middle of
the square, right where Number One usually parked his wagon. "He just
throws them all away," he would tell the hushed crowd. "And then he
goes back to the town---*our* town---and sucks all the light out of
the sky so that there's none left for us!" He imagined himself
stepping down off the crate and handing the spare can of light to
Sparkle, just to show how big-hearted he was. And then...

Well, he wasn't quite sure what would happen after that. Would the
grown-ups march into town with hoes and axes on their shoulders to
smash Number One's pump and break open his storage tanks? How would
they find their way there? And what would the robots do? If they were
all as strong as #20717, they could easily turn the villagers
away. And what about Number One and his clankers?

Gleam shook his head. He would let the grown-ups figure that part out.
Right now, he just wanted to gobble up a dozen fried peppers and a
handful of peas, then fall asleep in his own bed.

The robot jogged around another bend in the road. Gleam sprayed another
few drops of light into the air in front of them, then gasped. This
was where he had jumped onto Number One's wagon! The village must be
just above them!

"Stop! Stop!" Gleam said to the robot.

"What is it?" the robot asked.

"Put me down!" Gleam said.

The robot let Gleam slide to the ground. "Ow," Gleam whimpered,
stretching. His arms were still attached, but just barely, and his
legs felt like someone had been whacking them with a big stick.

"Are you all right?" #20717 asked anxiously. "Do you need to be
oiled?"

"No thanks, I'm all right." Gleam straightened up. "But we're almost
there. We're almost home!"

"Where the monsters are?" #20717 asked in a hushed voice.

"There aren't any monsters!" Gleam said, exasperated. The light he had
sprayed had faded, but he waved his arms in the darkness anyway,
forgetting for a moment that the robot could not see him. "There's
just people like me! Come on, I'll show you."

It seemed to take longer to reach the last bend in the road than it
had taken to come all the way from the town. The robot's heavy feet
went *trudge trudge trudge* on the road. Gleam didn't use any more
light as they walked. He could feel the ruts from Number One's
wagon's wheels under his feet. As long as he followed them, he would
stay on the road.

The ruts bent sharply to the right. He couldn't see it, but he knew
that the warning bell must be hanging somewhere nearby. He was so
excited that he could feel his heart pounding in his chest. He started
to walk faster, the bottle of light bumping against his leg. He could
almost feel the hug his mother was going to give him. He could
practically---

The robot grabbed Gleam's arm. Gleam almost jumped out of his
skin. "What was that?" #20717 whispered.

"What?" Gleam whispered back. "What was what?"

"I heard something," the robot said. "In the trees. Over there
somewhere."

"I didn't hear anything. Come on, let's go!"

"No! Please, wait." Gleam felt the robot's hand tremble. "I'm---I'm
scared."

"I told you, there's nothing to be scared of," Gleam said. He shook the
robot's hand off his arm. "Do all robots get frightened this easily?"

"Oh no, not at all," #20717 said. "I think it's because my new brain
is so good. I can imagine all sorts of things I could never have
thought of before, and they're all horrible."

"Hmph," Gleam said. "Well, I---"

"There it is again!" #20717 whispered urgently, squeezing Gleam's arm
so hard that it hurt. "Did you hear it?"

This time Gleam *had* heard something rustling in the trees. All of a
sudden he was as frightened as #20717. Could Number One somehow have
gotten ahead of them on the road? Was that sound one of his
clankers, snuffling around in the forest trying to find them?

He set the spare can of light on the ground, aimed the spray nozzle on
the bottle at the sound with both hands, and then hesitated. He could
hear someone speaking. He recognized that mutter! It was Grandma
Shimmer, talking to herself as she walked alone through the woods!

"That's not a monster," Gleam said, relieved. "That's just Grandma
Shimmer."

"What's a grannapwy pooh?" #20717 asked. "Does it bite?"

"Only sometimes," Gleam laughed, thinking about the time Grandma Shimmer
had taken her false teeth out to show him. He had been six years old,
and he had shrieked and laughed when she snapped them at him, *clack
clack clack*.

Gleam made a sudden decision. He couldn't hear her any longer, but she
must be following a path string, which meant they must be near her
house. He stepped forward cautiously with his arm in front of him
until he felt a tree, then sprayed a few drops of light onto it, so
that they wouldn't fade too quickly. A path string dangled between two
gnarly old pines a dozen steps away. He wondered for a moment if
Grandma Shimmer knew how close her daily walk took her to the road.

"Come on," he told #20717. "I know the way from here."

Gleam took small, careful steps until his hand found the path string.
"Here," he said to the robot. "Do you feel that? Just keep your hand
on it. I'll show you who Grandma Shimmer is. *Then* you'll see that
there aren't any monsters."

Gleam could have run down the path to Grandma Shimmer's house (even
though children were never, ever supposed to run, in case they tripped
over a fallen branch, or fell and broke the path string). Instead, he
walked slowly, chewing his lip, thinking about the spare can of light
the robot was carrying. It would give the can to Gleam without question
if he asked for it... And it would be such a nice present for his
mother and father...  Gleam shook his head. He was being silly. After
what he'd seen, one little can of light wasn't worth worrying about.

The path ran straight, then went right, then right again, then left,
then up a little rise, just nine steps. There they were, four round
beads and two square ones, worn with age. They were at Grandma Shimmer's
house.

Gleam took a deep breath and knocked on the door. "Grandma!" he called.
"Grandma Shimmer! It's me, Gleam!"

"Gleam?" He heard a creak as she got up out of her rocking chair. The
door flew open. Gleam suddenly found himself wrapped up in a fierce
hug.

"Oh, Gleam," Grandma Shimmer sniffled. "What happened? I told your father
that I'd given you some light, and you were right there on the path
string---how did you ever get lost? And how did you find your way
back?"

"I didn't get lost, Grandma," Gleam said. "I went to get some more light
from Number One. And you'll never guess what I found!"

"What?" Grandma Shimmer let go of the young boy. Gleam could almost hear
her frown in the darkness. "You went to get some more light? What
foolishness is this? Is this another one of your stories?"

"I did!" Gleam insisted. "I jumped in the back of his wagon, and went
all the way back to town. That's where he lives, Grandma, in *our*
town. And you'll never guess what else I found. Look!"

Gleam lifted up the can of light and sprayed a whole cupful into the
air.  *Splurt!* Grandma Shimmer's jaw dropped when she saw the robot
standing just a few paces behind Gleam.

"Hello," #20717 said uncertainly, raising his hand to wave.

"Oh no!" Grandma Shimmer shrieked. "It's them! They've found us! They've
found us!"

## Chapter 12 ----------

"Wait!" Gleam said. "He won't hurt you!" But it was too late. Grandma
Shimmer slammed the door shut, then yanked it open again so that she
could grab Gleam's arm.

"Get inside! Get inside!" she said frantically as she tried to drag
him into her little house.

"Grandma, stop!" Gleam pulled away from her so hard that he fell down on
the path at the robot's feet. Grandma Shimmer stooped over to pick up a
handful of stones and threw them at the robot.

"Get back! Get back, you loathsome thing!" she cried. The robot stood
there and let the stones bounce off its head and chest.

"Grandma, stop, please!" Gleam pleaded again. This wasn't what was
supposed to happen!

Grandma Shimmer bent over to pick up some more stones. At the same time,
the robot stepped forward to help Gleam to his feet, so that when
Grandma Shimmer straightened up, the robot was right in front of her
nose.

"Aaagh!" she cried. She stumbled backward. Her foot slipped on the
loose stones beneath her. As she fell backward, her head hit the door
frame with a sickening *crack!*

"Grandma!" Gleam cried. He knelt down beside her and took her hand just
as the last of the light he had sprayed faded away into nothing.

For one gut-wrenching moment Gleam couldn't find her pulse. There!
There it was---fast but strong. He heaved a sigh of relief.

"Help me get her into the house," he said. No-one answered.

Gleam twisted around. "Robot? Two oh seven one seven? Where are you?"
He listened as hard as he could, but couldn't hear a sound. The robot
had vanished.

Like every other child in the village, Gleam had been taught what to do
if something as bad as this ever happened. There was no blood, and
Grandma Shimmer was breathing: that was step one. Step two: were there
any grownups around? No. All right, he thought, step three: find
some. He closed his eyes for a moment and tried to remember where he
had been standing, and where Grandma Shimmer had been. If she was
*here*, then he had been *there*, so the bottle of light must be...

Gleam twisted around and swept his hand over the gravel. There. He
picked it up and squeezed the trigger handle. A few precious drops
spluttered onto Grandma Shimmer's front door. Then the can gurgled and
hissed. It was empty.

"Oh, great," he muttered, but there wasn't time to feel sorry for
himself. He would have to leave Grandma Shimmer on her own and go for
help.

But where was the robot? Gleam closed his eyes and listened as hard as
he could. "Are you there?" he asked uncertainly. "Number two oh seven
one seven?" No-one answered. All he could hear were forest sounds: the
wind in the leaves, the stream in the distance. He got to his feet and
grabbed the path string tied next to Grandma Shimmer's door. He could
worry about the robot later.

Gleam ran through the forest so fast that the path string practically
sizzled through his fingers. Seventy-one... two... three... went the
knots.

Suddenly he heard a voice in the trees up ahead. He stopped and
listened. There it was again. "Gleam!" Someone was calling his name.

"I'm here!" he shouted back. "Come quick! Grandma Shimmer's hurt!"

The path string twitched as someone walked toward him. "Gleam? Are you
there?" It was the schoolteacher.

"I'm right in front of you," he said.

The schoolteacher's hand found Gleam's on the string and closed around
it. "Gleam, where have you been?" he said harshly. "Everybody's been
looking for you!"

"I went to get some light from Number One," Gleam said. "But then---"

"You did what?" the teacher exclaimed. He squeezed Gleam's hand so hard
that it hurt.

"Never mind that," Gleam said frantically. "You have to come quickly.
Grandma Shimmer fell and hit her head."

"What happened?" the schoolteacher asked. Bumps on heads were
something he understood.

"The robot scared her. And I think she scared the robot, too. It ran
off. But it didn't do anything to her, I promise."

"Robot? Gleam, what are you talking about?" The teacher still hadn't
let go of Gleam's hand, as if he was afraid that the boy might run off
again.

"Please, you *have* to come!" Gleam pleaded. "Please!"

Gleam heard the schoolteacher take a deep breath. "Over here!" he
bellowed as loudly as he could. "I found him!" The teacher let go of
Gleam's hand and blew three quick, short blasts on his whistle.

Other whistles answered almost instantly from among the trees around
them. "Is it four round and two square?" the schoolteacher demanded.

"Yes," Gleam replied, massaging his hand. The teacher blew his whistle
again, *phweet phweet phweet phweet*, pause, *phoot phoot*.

"Come on," he said. "Show me where she is."

They walked quickly back to Grandma's house, Gleam in front, the teacher
behind him. The moment he felt the beads, Gleam said, "She's just in
front of her door."

The schoolteacher stopped. Gleam heard the tiny pop of a cork being
pulled from a bottle. A single drop of light flashed behind him,
casting shadows back into the darkness.

"Oh my," the schoolteacher said. Grandma Shimmer was lying right where
Gleam had left her. The schoolteacher let go of the path string and
knelt beside the old woman.

Gleam knelt down beside her as well and held his breath. After a moment
the schoolteacher said, "I think she's all right. Is her door open?"

"I think so," Gleam said. He scrambled to his feet and checked. "Yes,
it's open."

"All right. Help me get her inside. She's too old to be lying on the
ground like this."

Gleam grabbed Grandma Shimmer's ankles while the schoolteacher took her
shoulders. Her legs felt as skinny as a chicken's.

The schoolteacher had to use another drop of light to find Grandma
Shimmer's bed. They dropped her on top of its neatly-folded blankets.
"There," the schoolteacher said. "She'll be all right. Now tell me,
where have you been hiding? Everybody has been looking for you---the
whole village! And your mother and father have been frantic!"

"I told you, I wanted to get some more light from Number One," Gleam
said. "For the new baby. So I hid in his wagon, but he just threw
everything away except the rubies. He uses those to make brains for
his robots---the ones in the town. And he lives in a big building
called an obsav---an *observatory*, and when I tried to get away, the
wagon went right off the side of the mountain, and I almost fell, but
the crows put me in a tree, and---"

"Gleam!" the schoolteacher said sharply. "Do you have any idea how much
trouble you're in? Lots, that's how much, lots and lots. And do you
think that telling a mish-mash story like this is going to make things
better, or get you in deeper? Hm? It's going to get you in deeper,
isn't it? Now, where were you? And why did you run away?"

"But I didn't run away!" Gleam protested. "I told you, I just wanted to
get some more light. Sparkle spilled ours!"

"Sparkle said that you two had a fight," the teacher said
grimly. "About what happened in the square. He said you were making
fun of him, and showing off how much light you had, but then you
dropped your bottle."

"What?" Gleam was stunned. "That's not what happened! I wanted to give
him some, because he didn't get any from Number One, but then he made
me drop ours. That's why I went after Number One!"

"Gleam..." his teacher growled. Gleam opened his mouth to protest once
again, but just then he heard footsteps outside. *Phweet!* went a
whistle.

"We're in here!" the teacher shouted. "Inside the house!"

"Gleam?" It was his father. A moment later Gleam was getting the biggest
hug of his life.

"Oh, Gleam, we were so scared," his father said, squeezing him so hard
that his ribs creaked. "Your mother and I were so, so scared. Where
have you been?"

And so Gleam tried to tell his story again: what had happened to their
light, how he'd chased after Number One's wagon, what Number One had
done with the songs and mushrooms that everyone had given him, the
talking cane, the attack by the crows... He hadn't even reached the
town when the schoolteacher cut him off.

"He tried to tell me the same kind of story," the big man said to
Gleam's father. "Now, I think every child should have a bit of
imagination, but this---we've used nearly fifteen cups of light
looking for him, you know."

"I know, I know," Gleam's father said. "And I'll pay them back, every
one." He sighed and hugged his son again, but not quite so hard, not
quite so close. "Gleam, this is wrong." He shook his son gently. "You
*know* this is wrong. Spilling all of our light was bad, but running
away was much, much worse. We can always get more light, but where
would we ever find another Gleam? And it was an especially bad thing to
do now, when the baby is so close. Your mother is supposed to be at
home, but instead she's been out searching with everyone else." His
father hugged him again, but it was a different kind of hug, a 'trying
not to be angry' hug.

"But it's all true," Gleam said, hopelessness welling up inside him. He
had thought he was going to be a hero. He had never imagined that
people wouldn't believe him. Not even his own father! If only the
robot hadn't run away! If only---

"Hello?" said a woman's voice outside.

"We're in here," the schoolteacher said.

"Did you find him?" the voice asked. It was one of the other women
from the village.

"Yes. He's all right. So is Grandma Shimmer."

"Good," the woman said. "Because your wife needs you. Her time has
come.  She's having the baby!"

## Chapter 13 ----------

"I'll look after Grandma Shimmer," the teacher told Gleam's father. "You
go help with the baby."

Gleam and his father ran back through the woods so fast that Gleam lost
count of the knots on the path string as they flew through his
fingers.  Gleam was so tired that he stumbled a couple of times, but he
didn't say a word, or ask his father to slow down.

When they reached the village, they saw a thin sheet of light leaking
out from beneath the door of the birthday house. A handful of people
stood in front of it, their feet casting long shadows. Gleam heard his
mother groaning and calling his father's name inside.

"You found him!" one of them said to Gleam's father.

"He was at Grandma Shimmer's," his father panted. "How is she?"

"She's fine," an older woman said. "Go in, go in."

Gleam's father reached for the door, then hesitated. "You stay here,"
he ordered Gleam.

"But I want to help!" Gleam said plaintively.

"The best way for you to help is to *stay here*," his father said
roughly.

He opened the door to the birthday house. Light spilled out onto the
faces of the people who were waiting. Everyone seemed to be frowning.
"...picked a worse time..." someone muttered. Gleam felt his ears
burn. The door closed with a *thump*.

A heavy hand came down on Gleam's shoulder. It was the schoolteacher.
"Let's you and I have a word, shall we?" he said. Gleam opened his
mouth to protest, but the schoolteacher pulled him around the side of
the birthday house, away from the small crowd.

"Now, you listen to me," the schoolteacher said once the walls of the
birthday house were between them and everyone else. "You listen to me
with both ears. I do *not* want to hear you telling tales about
chasing after Number One, or flying wagons, or any other such
nonsense, do you hear? You'll just unsettle people, and there's no
point in doing that, none at all."

"But---"

"No 'buts', boy," the schoolteacher said roughly, shaking Gleam. "Your
mother and father are going to need all the help they can get these
next few months. If I hear that you're telling tales, well, you know,
they just might not get that help. They just might have to try to take
care of that new baby in the dark. Do you understand me?"

"Hey, that's not fair!" Gleam protested. "You can't take our light
away!"

"You don't *have* any light to take away, remember? Because somebody
spilled it. The only light your family's going to see this week is
what's in the emergency barrel, and you wont' get a drop of it unless
*I* say so. Now, am I going to hear any tales out of you?"

Gleam nodded and swallowed. "No, sir," he said, in exactly the same
voice that the villagers used when they said, "Thank you, Number
One."

The schoolteacher let go of him. "All right then, off with you." Gleam
stumbled back to the front of the birthday house to wait.

An hour went by, or maybe two. In the darkness, there was no way to
tell. A few more people drifted into the village as word spread that
Gleam's mother's time had come. None of them said anything to Gleam.

The groaning inside the birthday house grew louder and louder. Gleam
bowed his head. *Please, let it be all right,* he begged. He felt
exhausted. *Please.*

Suddenly he heard another sound, a high-pitched crying. A minute
later, the light from inside the birthday house faded away. The woman
who had fetched Gleam and his father from Grandma Shimmer's opened the
door.

"It's a boy," she said. "They're calling him Iji."

"Ahh... Iji..." everyone sighed. A few people clapped their
hands. Gleam felt like a wrung-out rag. "Can I see him?" he asked.

"Of course," the woman said. She guided Gleam around the chair that
stood by the door, and over to the birthday bed. "Gleam?" his mother
said weakly.

"I'm here," Gleam choked. He rushed forward to the bed and patted along
the blanket until he felt his mother's hand.

"Oh, Gleam," she whispered, squeezing his hand weakly. "I was so afraid
that we'd lost you, but today we get you back, and a new little boy
too.  Here, he's right here." She put her son's hand on the newborn
baby's head.

Gleam felt his little brother move. "He's so warm," he marveled.

Gleam's mother and the baby stayed in the birthday house that night,
while Gleam and his father went home. As they walked along the path,
his father sighed. "All right, Gleam. I think it's time you told me
what really happened. Why did you run away?"

"I didn't run away," Gleam told him hopelessly. "Not really. I just
wanted to get some more light for the baby. And then all sorts of
stuff just... happened."

Gleam's father was silent for a few steps. Then he spoke very
quietly. "I hope you grow out of this soon, son. I'd hate for you to
set a bad example for your new brother." He didn't say another word
until they were home.

"You'd better get to bed," Gleam's father said once they were
inside. "We have a lot of mushrooms to pick tomorrow."

"Why bother?" Gleam muttered. "Number One just throws them away."

"Gleam, that's enough!" his father snapped. "I don't want to hear
another word about it!"

The next two days should have been the happiest of Gleam's life. His
mother came home with the baby, and Gleam got to hold him. He was as
warm as a cup of hot chocolate, and smelled like... well, like milk
and poop and warm wet skin, it was wonderful anyway.

But the baby was the only good thing about those two days. Each
morning, Gleam got up hours before school, got dressed, and followed
his father out into the woods to pick mushrooms. A few days before, he
had enjoyed helping. It was grown-up work, and a chance to play word
games with his father, or tell him jokes he'd heard at school.

Not now, though. He tramped through the forest with a safety string
around his waist leading back to the main path string, thinking the
whole time about streetlights. He ran his hands over the stumps of
fallen trees looking for mushroom nests, all the while imagining
Number One dumping his sack into the ditch. And as he gathered fallen
branches for the crackling lightless fire that keep his mother and the
new baby warm, he wondered where #20717 had gone. Life in the village
would be so much easier if they just had a few robots to do their
chores. Most of all, he felt sorry for himself.

School was worse. The first day, he walked into the village as if
nothing had changed. He took his usual place in the circle on the
floor around the teacher.

Sparkle was waiting for him. "Run away, run away," the bigger boy said
sing-song under his breath, too quietly for the teacher to hear.

"Did not," Gleam whispered back fiercely.

"Quiet there," the teacher said sternly. One of the girls in the class
giggled, then clapped her hands over her mouth. Gleam felt his ears
burn.  The second time Sparkle thumped his arm (sneezing so that the
teacher wouldn't hear it), Gleam just bum-shuffled out of reach.

Then came recess. "Gleam's a 'fraidy bat, Gleam's a 'fraidy bat,"
Sparkle sang. "What's the matter, clankers got your tongue?"

"Leave me alone," Gleam said angrily. "I was only trying to help. I was
only trying to help *you*, remember? You were the one who didn't get
any light, and then you spilled all of mine."

"Gleam's a liar, Gleam's a liar," Sparkle sang. Gleam heard other
children gathering around, whispering. He suddenly knew what a mouse
must feel like, caught in a corner without a hole to hide in.

"Am not!" Gleam said hotly. "Number One didn't give you any light
because he heard you calling yourself 'mister', so I went to give you
some of mine, but you spilled it all. On purpose!"

"Gleam's a liar, Gleam's a liar." A few other children had picked up the
song.

"I am *not*!" Gleam shouted. "And I didn't run away. We don't have
runaways in *my* family!"

At that, Sparkle threw himself at Gleam. Children shrieked, "Fight!
Fight!" The teacher was there in moments. By then, Gleam was face-down
in the dirt, thrashing vainly to shake the bigger boy off his back.

When school was over, Gleam limped home. His father was waiting for
him.  Somehow, he had already heard about the fight. It was bad enough
that Gleam had run off, just when his mother needed him to be a
grown-up. But now this! What had gotten into him?

Gleam tried to explain, of course. He hadn't started the fight, and
anyway, it wasn't fair. He really had been trying to help Sparkle,
that's how everything started. His father was no more interested in
his story than he had been the day before.

That's how Gleam found himself sitting on an old stump in front of
their house, carefully picking the thread out of an old canvas
mushroom bag.  The bag was almost worn through in places, but the
stitching was still good. Thread was so tricky to make that everyone
re-used it whenever they could. It was delicate, tedious, finicky,
boring work---the perfect punishment, in a father's eyes, for a boy
who had let his imagination get the better of his honesty and common
sense.

He was holding the bag, wondering what he could do to make things
right, when he heard footsteps on the path. "Hello from the house," he
called.

"Hello there." It was Grandma Shimmer.

Gleam stood up. "Hello, Grandma," he said. "How are you feeling?"

"Oh, I'm fine. My head's taken harder knocks than that one. I've come
to see the new baby. I missed its birthday, what with all the
excitement."

"I'm sorry," Gleam said. She patted his shoulder with a bony hand and
knocked on the door.

Gleam stayed outside on his stump while Grandma Shimmer said all the
things that old women say to young women about new-born babies. Oh, he
was a big one, wasn't he? Such soft skin... And such little ears, and
such tiny fingers. Gleam wondered if people had said the same things
about him. He was sort of afraid that they had.

Finally Grandma Shimmer said goodbye to Gleam's mother and came back
outside. "He's a fine little boy," she sighed. "Just like you were."

"Thank you," Gleam said, not knowing what else to say.

Grandma Shimmer chuckled. Her hand found his shoulder. "Now," she said,
her tone turning serious, "Why don't you walk with me for a bit? I
think we have some things to talk about."

## Chapter 14 ----------

Gleam's heart sank. He was sure Grandma Shimmer was going to give him a
lecture about running away, or about making her fall and hit her head.
He didn't think he could stomach another lecture. "All right, Grandma,"
he sighed. He put the old canvas bag in the odds-and-ends box next to
the front door and followed her up the path.

Grandma Shimmer turned right at the main path string, instead of turning
left toward the village. Gleam trudged along behind her in silence,
wondering where they were going. This path led into the forest, toward
an old stream whose gravel banks had been picked clean of rubies long
before Gleam was born.

Gleam heard the stream burbling as they approached the end of the path
string. "Used to be just here," Grandma Shimmer muttered. "Ah! There we
are. Now, come sit with me, young man." Grandma Shimmer lowered her
creaky old bones onto a fallen log and patted the wood beside
her. Gleam stretched out until he felt the log, then let go of the path
string and sat down next to her.

"I used to come here, oh, every week, at least," Grandma Shimmer said
softly. "Back when I was about your mother's age. My husband would
look after our children for an afternoon, and I'd come out here, and
take off my clothes, and go for a swim in the stream, all on my own."
She sighed.

"What's a 'swim'?" Gleam asked, not really wanting to think about
Grandma Shimmer taking off all her clothes.

"What? Oh, swimming means playing in the water. Floating in it, and
splashing around, and holding your breath and diving like a fish. I
learned how to do it before the light went away. It was almost my
favorite thing when I was little."

"Wasn't it dangerous?" Gleam asked. Like every other child in the
village, he had been taught to be very careful around water. You could
drown so easily, or lose your bearings and come out on the wrong side
of the stream, or be swept away, and never be heard from again.

"Oh, it's safe enough once you know how," Grandma Shimmer said. "But I
don't suppose anyone swims any more, do they? No, I don't suppose they
could learn... Not in the dark."

Gleam bent over and picked up a couple of pebbles. "I guess not." He
tossed the first one into the water. *Ploop!* He tossed the second.
*Ploop!*

The silence stretched. Gleam and Grandma Shimmer sat side by side, lost
in their own thoughts. Finally the old woman sighed again. "A lot of
things were different back then," she said, almost to herself. "But
then everything changed. I've told you the story, haven't I? About the
night the dragon came?"

"Yes, Grandma," Gleam said.

"I was getting ready for bed," she continued, as if she hadn't heard
him. "I brushed my teeth, and picked out a story for my father to read
to me, just like he always did. But instead, he told me about a
strange comet that the scientists at the observatory had discovered. A
comet, that's like a ball of light in the sky, with a long tail behind
it. This one wasn't like other comets. It kept changing direction,
almost as if it was looking for something. I asked if it might hit
us. My father laughed and told me not to worry about. Then he tucked
me in, and went downstairs."

"The next thing I remember, there was a sound like thunder, except it
went on and on. I jumped out of bed and ran over to the window so that
I could see the lightning. Oh, I know, you don't know what lightning
is either, do you? It doesn't matter... Back then, I thought lightning
was good luck, and I always made a wish when I saw it."

"But I didn't see any that night. What I saw..." She paused before
going on. "What I saw was houses burning, and people running through
the streets in panic. And when I looked up, I saw the dragon. She was
as a big as a house, with wings like a bat, and a long neck like a
snake. She swooped down on the town, and spat fire onto the houses."

"My father came pounding up the stairs. He told my mother and me to
run away. I didn't have time to get dressed---I just put on my rubber
boots, and took my mother's hand, and ran out in my pajamas. My father
went to help put out the fires. I never saw him again."

Grandma Shimmer paused again. Gleam heard a faint squelch as she wiped
her eyes. "I'm sorry," the young boy said awkwardly.

"Oh, that's all right," the old woman lied. "It was a long time ago."
She patted his hand in the darkness. "But that's not why I wanted to
talk to you today. I wanted to tell you a part of the story that most
people don't know."

"Everyone was out on the streets that night, running here and there.
Some people were trying to find their families. Others were trying to
save old pictures from the fire, or a favorite quilt. It was all so
confused."

"Somehow, my mother and I let go of each other. I don't really know
what happened. I think I might have bumped into someone, or maybe she
did, I don't remember. All I remember is standing there, all alone in
my pajamas and rubber boots, with people running and shouting all
around me, and the dragon shrieking and flaming overhead."

"I kept shouting, 'Mommy, mommy,' but with everything else that was
going on, even I couldn't hear myself. I was so afraid of getting
lost, or of being left behind, or even of someone trampling me. I was
so afraid..."

"So I did the only thing I could think of: I ran back to our house. It
was probably the most dangerous place I could have gone, but I was
just little, and it was the only place I was sure my mother and father
would know to look."

"But I never got there. Our house was right on the edge of town, next
to a little park. I always took a short cut across the park. I took it
that night, and that's when I saw them. Dozens of them---hundreds,
even."

"At first I thought they were people from the town, but then... I
don't think they were really people at all, at least not people like
us. They were all completely bald, and their skins were... I don't
know. Shiny, almost, as if they polished themselves instead of washing
with soap and water like decent folks do. And they were all
*smiling*." She gave a nervous little laugh. "That's when I got
*really* frightened. The whole world was on fire, and I was lost, and
they were all smiling."

"So I turned around and ran back the way I had come, straight into my
mother's arms. I'd been right---she was coming to look for me at our
house. She picked me up and carried me out of town with everyone
else. I remember looking back over her shoulder at the fires,
wondering what was going to happen to us. That was the last time I
ever saw my home."

Gleam opened his mouth to say, "I'm sorry," again, but Grandma Shimmer
wasn't finished. "That was also the last time I saw one of
those... those...  whatever they were, the bald people with the
smiles. Until the other night, that is." Gleam heard her shift her
weight on the log beside him.  "There was one of them with you when
you knocked on my door, wasn't there?"

"Yes, Grandma," Gleam said. "Number two oh seven one seven."

"What?" she asked sharply.

"Number two oh seven one seven," Gleam repeated. "I guess that's its
name. They're robots. Number One uses the rubies we give him to make
brains for them. I saw them, lots of them, in town. They've fixed it
all up again. Everything's neat and tidy, and painted, and they sweep
the leaves off the streets. Even the streetlights work."

"How do you know about streetlights?" she breathed. "Did your grappa
tell you about them?"

"I *saw* them," Gleam said angrily. For a moment, he had thought that
Grandma Shimmer was going to believe him---that she was going to make
everyone believe him. "And the fountain in the middle of town. *And*
the ob---the ob-ser-va-tor-y." He sounded the word out
carefully. "That's where Number One has his workshop."

"I don't believe it," she whispered. "I thought---I know I banged my
head when I fell. I've still got the lump. I thought I'd dreamed the
bald man. He was really there, wasn't he? And you really did go back
to town with Number One."

Gleam could hardly believe his ears. All he could think to say was,
"Yes, Grandma. But no-one believes me. My father and the schoolteacher
don't, anyway."

"I'm still not sure *I* believe you," she replied sharply. "But...
streetlights. And the observatory---oh, I remember the observatory. My
father worked there, you know. Not as one of the scientists, just as a
janitor, but sometimes he'd take me with him and let me look at the
telescope."

"I saw the telescope," Gleam said. "It was like a tree, only it was
being held up by a thing like this." He brushed his fingers along the
log until he found Grandma Shimmer's hand, then made a 'U' with his own
for her to feel.

"Yes..." she said. "It was like that. It was so they could tilt it up
and down, and turn it, so that they could point it wherever they
wanted."

"Why?" Gleam asked.

"So they could see things far away. It had these enormous pieces of
glass, a big one at the top and a smaller one at the bottom."

"Like lenses?"

"Now, how would you know about... Yes, they were lenses. My father
said they concentrated the light, so that the scientists could see
things that were very faint, or very far away." The old woman
paused. When she spoke, her voice was wistful. "I remember him riding
his bicycle up the hill to work every morning. I had a little bicycle
of my own. I wanted so much to learn how to ride it so that I could go
with him. But I never got to. I never went on a bike ride with my
father. There were so many things that none of us got to do... That
we'll never do, as long as we're stuck here in the dark."

"But we could go back," Gleam said tentatively. "Couldn't we? There
probably aren't really that many robots. And I didn't see the dragon
at all. It might have left. If you could make everyone believe that I
really was there, maybe we could---"

"Me?" she snorted. "They're not going to listen to an addled old woman
who just bumped her head, any more than they'd listen to a little
fibber who ran off because he was mad that his mother was having a
baby. I know, I know, you didn't really, but that's what everyone
thinks. That's what our noble schoolteacher has them all believing,
anyway, pompous muck that he is." She snorted.

They sat together in the darkness for a time, the young boy and the
old woman, lost in despair. The stream burbled past them on its way
down the mountain, not knowing light from darkness, and not caring,
either.

"Well, we're not going to change the world today," Grandma Shimmer
finally said. She *oophed* as she got up from the log. "So I suppose
we should both get back to our chores."

"Yes, Grandma," Gleam said obediently. She was right. He should go and
finish his chores. But then...

## Chapter 15 ----------

The next day, when lessons were over, Gleam stood up and clapped to
thank the teacher like everyone else. Then, just like every other day,
the children joined hands, so that they could file out of the
classroom without bumping into each other.

But not Gleam. Not today. He took a step back and flattened himself
against the wall, breathing as quietly as he could. The children's
voices faded as they scattered along the path strings back to their
homes. The only sound left was the schoolteacher tidying up his desk
by touch.

This was the part that had worried Gleam most. If the schoolteacher
used even a single drop of light to help him with his end-of-day
chores, he would be sure to see Gleam. If that happened, Gleam decided,
he would have to bluff. "I wanted to ask you some questions about the
lesson," or, "Sparkle is still bullying me, but I don't want to
complain in front of everyone else, because that will just make it
worse." The second one wouldn't even be a lie...

However, everyone knew how stingy the schoolteacher was. Every family
in the village gave him a few drops of light each week, but he hardly
ever used it. He didn't need to, since he didn't have to hunt in the
woods for mushrooms and songs, or scrape through gravel looking for
rubies. He didn't even need it for his garden, since the children took
turns bringing him his lunch.

"They'll spend their lives in the dark," he told parents, comforting
or stern depending on his mood. "If I splash light all over the place,
it'll just taken them longer to get used to the idea." So the
villagers told themselves that the schoolteacher knew best, and that
it was his business what he did with his light.

But they wondered sometimes. Was he saving it up for someone special?
Or did he wait until he had enough to fill his bathtub, then lie down
in it?

None of them ever imagined the truth. None of them ever imagined that
the light they gave him slowly accumulated in bottle after bottle on
the shelves in his house (which was the only building in the village
other than the school to have a lock on its door). No-one but the
schoolteacher knew that sometimes he woke up shivering in the
darkness.  The only way he could get back to sleep was to count his
bottles, one by one, to reassure himself that yes, he would always
have enough. Almost enough. Almost...

Sure enough, the schoolteacher tidied up in complete darkness. It took
him two hundred and twenty nine of Gleam's heartbeats to finish. Gleam
counted them slowly in his head.

"Well, then," the schoolteacher finally said aloud, "Time to go home."
He crossed the floor just an arm's length from Gleam. The door opened
with a slight squeak. (No door in the village was perfectly quiet.
People said, "Oh, I really should put some beeswax on those hinges,"
but no-one ever did, because no-one wanted children sneaking up on
them and going "boo!") The key clicked faintly in the lock, *snick
snack*. Gleam was locked in.

Which was exactly where he wanted to be. He had tossed and turned all
night, trying to think of a better plan, but it always came down to
the same question: where could he get enough light? Not his mother and
father---they only had a few drops, which they needed to help the baby
learn how to see. Not Grandma Shimmer---even if she believed him, she
would say it was too dangerous. And everyone else still thought he was
a liar.

That left only the emergency barrel in the village square, or the
bottle that the schoolteacher kept for the school. The barrel was for
emergencies, like fires and lost children. Gleam could never have taken
any light from there. If someone got lost, and couldn't be found
because there wasn't enough light, well, Gleam didn't even want to
think about how he'd feel.

So there he stood, hiding in the school when everyone else had gone
home. He was about to become the worst thing in the world: a light
thief.

*But I'm doing it to help everyone,* he told himself once again. He
couldn't live in darkness for the rest of his life, knowing what he
knew. He couldn't let everyone else live that way either. At the age
of twelve, he had discovered that knowledge could be as powerful as
gravity. Just knowing something could tug at you until you had no
choice but to move.

He took the bottle of light from the schoolteacher's desk. In its
place he left the note that he had secretly pricked out a word at a
time during class. *I took it. I will bring it back. Gleam.*

The door unlocked itself when he twisted the handle. He closed it
carefully behind him, so that bats and raccoons couldn't get in. There
was no sense breaking more rules than he had to.

He followed the main path string through the village to the road that
led down the mountain. When he reached the path string's end he felt
around until his fingers found a long, skinny fern. He pulled it out
and patted the ground some more, looking for a rock as big as his two
fists put together. When he found one, he set it down carefully in one
of the ruts in the road, then stood up. With a deep breath, he set
off.

He used to rut to guide himself. Even so, he stumbled every dozen
steps, and tripped completely once or twice. Still, it was better than
using any more light than he had to.

He kept walking past the first bend in the road until it leveled off.
There, he slowed, unsure. Was this where he had jumped onto Number
One's wagon? Or was it further ahead?

He shook his head and kept going. Even if this was the place, the
wagon had bumped along for another few minutes before Number One had
stopped it to dump the songs and mushrooms out of his sack.

Trudge, trudge, trudge... Finally Gleam stopped again and tucked his
fern under his arm. He held the bottle of light up to his ear and
shook it.  From the way it gurgled, he guessed that it was about half
full. He pulled the stopper out and poured a couple of drops onto the
fern.

As quickly as he could, he put the stopper back in the bottle and held
the stick up high. It lit the scene around him like his own personal
streetlight.

And there they were! Gleam couldn't believe his luck. The mushrooms and
songs were right in front of him!

Then he looked a little more closely. These mushrooms were
rotten---they must have been there for weeks. And the songs had been
pecked to pieces by birds. He poured some more light on his fern and
looked again. There was another pile further on down the road, and yet
another one behind him. Number One must have been dumping his sack
here for years.

Gleam shook his head. It didn't matter. Proof was proof. He pulled his
mushrooming bag from his belt and started to fill it.

The mushrooms were slimy. Hard-shelled beetles scuttled away as he
gingerly picked them up. Some of the songs were so brittle that they
crumbled into dust when he touched them. Even so, he kept at it grimly
until his sack was full.

The mushrooms squelched in the bag as he retraced his steps. They
stank, too, but he didn't care. Now he had proof. Now everyone would
*have* to believe him.

He had just passed the bend in the road when a twig snapped in the
forest ahead of him. He froze, listening. He couldn't hear anything
except the soft whisper of the wind through the pines. No, wait! That
was a branch being pushed out of someone's way.

Gleam swallowed a dry mouthful of nothing. He had told #20717 that
there weren't any monsters, not really, but all of a sudden he wasn't
sure.  Whatever it was sounded too big to be a raccoon. And no-one
else from the village had any reason to come this way, unless---no,
they couldn't be looking for him yet. *Not that they would,* he
thought sourly, but he immediately felt guilty for thinking it.

Another twig snapped. Gleam didn't move. He couldn't run without light,
but if he used even a drop, whatever was out there would see him.

Slowly, very slowly, Gleam raised his right foot and set it down a few
inches further up the road. Good. He hadn't knocked any stones. He
hadn't made any noise. He raised his left foot, froze with it in
mid-air at the sound of another branch being pushed aside, then
finished the step just as carefully as the first. Another,
another... He stopped. It would take him forever to get back to the
village at this rate, and sooner or later, no matter how careful he
was, he'd make a noise. All he could do was wait.

Rustle... snap... rustle... The sounds in the forest slowly grew
fainter.  Whatever it was, it was moving away from him. Gleam stood
like a statue until he could hear it no longer, then stood for a few
minutes more.  Only then did he let himself take a deep breath. He
shook his head. Life had been easier when it was boring.

Around the bend, up the hill toward the path string... The closer he
got, the faster he walked. The evil-smelling slime from the rotten
mushrooms had soaked through the sack into his shirt, making an
unpleasant damp patch on his skin. Suddenly his toes bumped into the
rock he had left in the rut an hour before. He took another step
forward, then swung the stick slowly from side to side. *Thunk*. That
must be the tree the path string was tied to.

He reached out cautiously. Yes, there it was. He grinned. He was home
free. He dropped his fern---

---and yelped in terror as a hand came down on his shoulder.

## Chapter 16 ----------

"And where do you think *you're* going?" It was the schoolteacher. He
must have been waiting silently by the path string. His bony fingers
dug into Gleam's shoulder.

"I was just---I went to get some of the mushrooms and songs that
Number One dumped out in the ditch," Gleam said. "So that everyone
would believe me." He held out his dripping canvas sack, even though
he knew that the teacher couldn't see it in the dark.

"Are you *still* telling that story?" the schoolteacher
snarled. "Don't you think you've caused enough trouble? Don't you
think you've shamed your mother and father enough? First you pick a
fight with Sparkle. Then you spill all of your family's light, then
you run away---when your mother is having a baby, no less! When you
come back, you nearly split Grandma Shimmer's head open. And if that
wasn't enough, you keep telling these ridiculous stories, even after I
told you not to! Gleam, everyone wants more light. No-one likes having
to work as hard as we do for the little we get. But we should be
grateful for it, not make up fairy tales and play wish-it-was games!
And we *certainly* shouldn't go around stealing other people's light."

"I didn't steal it!" Gleam protested angrily. "I just---"

"Do you think you're the first child to try to hide in the school
after class?" the teacher asked. His fingers dug so deeply into Gleam's
shoulder that the boy yelped and tried to pull away, but the
schoolteacher wouldn't let go. He shook Gleam as he spoke. "Do you?
Well, you're not. Plenty of other children have thought that they
could wait until I was gone, then take a look at the answers to the
arithmetic homework, or put a stink-frog in my desk drawer. But you
are the first, the very first, to ever take any of the school
light. Now, give it back to me."

"But---"

"Give it back, or I won't just tell your father. I'll tell the whole
village. You know what will happen then, don't you? You'll be shunned
for a year. Now, give it back." The schoolteacher snapped his fingers.

Slowly, with a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach, Gleam handed the
bottle of light to the teacher. "But will you at least take a look at
what I found?" he asked hopelessly. He shook the bag of mushrooms a
couple of times so that the schoolteacher could hear where it was.

The schoolteacher snatched the bag out of his hands. "I don't *care*
what you found!" the schoolteacher snarled. "Do you understand me?
Things are just fine the way they are! We have all the light we need,
or almost, and we *don't* need anyone stirring things up!" He whirled
the sack around and threw it into the darkness. It hit the ground a
moment later with a soggy *plomph*.

Gleam heard the schoolteacher's deep, angry breathing. "I'm warning
you, Gleam. I'm warning you for the last time. One more incident like
this, and I *will* tell your parents that you stole the school's
light. Your parents, and everyone else. I will *not* have you stirring
everyone up with your crazy stories. And if I ever think, even for a
moment, that you really have done something as log-headed as chasing
after Number One, I will drag you out into the darkness myself and
tie you to a tree and whistle until the clankers come for you. Now,
go home."

With that, the teacher turned and walked away, muttering to
himself. The path string twitched in Gleam's fingers until the teacher
reached the next tree. His footsteps died away in the distance. There
was no sound left except the wind in the pines, and the lonely
*chirrup* of a night cricket.

Gleam had failed. It wouldn't matter what he showed people now. If the
teacher told them that he had taken the school's light, their ears
would snap shut like doors being slammed to keep out the rain.

Gleam smacked the tree beside him in frustration. What was he supposed
to do now? Even if everyone *did* work hard, there might not be any
more light anyway, not unless Number One had a spare wagon. *Or maybe
he'll just leave us all here in the dark,* Gleam thought. It would
serve everyone right. If they didn't want to listen to him, well, it
would just serve them right!

He smacked the tree again, then kicked it. He was angrier than he had
ever been. It just wasn't fair! "It's just... not... fair!" he said
aloud, kicking the tree with each word.

A moment later, something went *plomph* at Gleam's feet.

Gleam prodded it gingerly with his toe. It was his mushrooming sack,
all right. Someone had definitely just thrown his mushrooming sack
back to him.

He picked it up, and tossed it into the darkness once again. *Plomph.*
One heartbeat, two, three... *Plomph,* right back at his feet.

"Is this a game?" a familiar voice asked out of the darkness. "Are we
having fun?"

"Number two oh seven one seven?" Gleam gasped. "Is that you?"

"Yes it is," the robot's voice replied. "At least, I think it is. I'm
not really sure any longer. I don't seem to be the same 'me' that I
was a couple of days ago. Is it your turn now?"

"My turn? Oh, the sack... Where have you been? Why did you run off
like that?" Gleam slapped the tree again. He was still angry. "Everyone
would have believed me if they'd seen you. Why did you run away?"

Silence, and then, "I was scared," the robot said quietly. "I had
never been scared before. I guess my old brain wasn't smart enough for
it. But then the Grandma Shimmer monster started making all that noise,
and throwing stones at me. I didn't know it was a game. I didn't know
what games were, really, until I heard you and your friends playing
some."

"She wasn't playing a game," Gleam said glumly. "She was just as scared
of you as you were of her. Maybe even more scared, I bet. But hey,
what do you mean, you heard us playing games? Have you been spying on
us?"

"What does 'spying' mean?" the robot asked.

"Sitting really quietly in the dark and listening to people when they
don't know you're there."

"Oh, then yes, I have been spying on you. I have been spying on
everyone. I have learned so many new things, my brain is practically
buzzing."

"I don't suppose you've learned how to get people to believe that
you're telling the truth for a change, have you?" Gleam asked glumly.

"I don't know," the robot said. "I've never tried."

"Well, would you like to? You could come back with me and let everyone
see you. Then they'd *have* to believe me."

"Do you think so?" the robot said doubtfully. "I think they would just
throw stones at me like the Grandma Shimmer monster did. Especially if
that loud man you were just talking to tells them to."

Gleam sighed dejectedly. "You're probably right. Anyway, you shouldn't
call Grandma Shimmer a monster."

"But she threw stones," the robot replied reasonably.

"That's just because she was scared!"

"Well, I was scared too, but I didn't throw anything. Oh, I just had a
thought, about throwing. What if you showed them some of the other
things Number One has thrown away? Would they believe you then?"

"You mean more mushrooms and songs? I doubt it," Gleam said sourly.

"No, I mean the other things. I still have the other can of light that
we brought. And I found some things in the forest when I was looking
for a place to think. Would you like to see them?"

"What kind of things?" Gleam asked.

"Come on, I'll show you." Heavy footsteps crunched on the ground. Gleam
shrank back instinctively, but the robot reached out in the dark and
found his arm. "Don't worry, we won't get lost. Once I have walked
somewhere, I always remember the way."

Gleam put his hand on the robot's shoulder. It led him down the side of
the mountain, through the trees, around a fallen tree, and over a big
half-buried rock. Finally it stopped.

"It's right here," the robot said. "Would you like some light?"

"Yes, please," Gleam said. He heard the robot unscrew the cap on the
can of light (how could he have forgotten about that? he wondered
briefly).  The robot dipped one finger in the can and held it up.

There, on the ground in front of them, was a skeleton. A human
skeleton.  With a skull.

"Oh..." Gleam gasped. He hesitated, then knelt down. Something shiny
reflected the light just before it faded.

"Can I have some more light, please?" Gleam asked. The robot dipped its
finger again. Gleam reached out and picked up the square piece of metal
that he had noticed.

"It's Sparkle's father," Gleam said. "This is his belt buckle. I
remember it---it came from the town. Sparkle was supposed to get it
one day, but then his father went into the woods and never came back."

"Did Number One throw him away?" the robot asked.

"I don't think so. I think he just fell, or something." Gleam shivered.
He could have slipped on a loose stone, and banged his head, or broken
his leg, and never found his way back to a path string. It could have
happened so easily. It could just as easily have happened to Gleam.

Gleam sat down, hefting the belt buckle in his hand. "I should give
this to Sparkle," he said. "But even then, no-one would believe
me. Not unless you came with me. And even then..." Gleam sighed. "What
could we do?  Really? The town is so far away, and you're all so
strong... Even if we did try, all of us, the robots would just make us
go away again. It's hopeless..."

The wind sighed, and Gleam sighed with it. "I just had an idea," the
robot said slowly. "What if *you* came with *me*? What if we convinced
the other robots that they don't always have to do what Number One
says?"

Gleam sat in the dark beside the skeleton of Sparkle's father, with the
heavy silver belt buckle in his hand. It was supposed to have been
Sparkle's... And Grandma Shimmer never got to go on a bike ride with her
father... He took a deep breath. Sometimes knowledge was as strong as
gravity...

"All right," Gleam said. "But this time, I'm going to tell Grandma
Shimmer where I'm going."

## Chapter 17 ----------

Grandma Shimmer wasn't home, so Gleam left her a note. *Dear Grandma*, it
said, *The robot came back. We are going to town to get the other
robots to help us.* He hesitated. Should he tell her what had happened
with the teacher? Gleam tapped his writing pin against the leaf for a
moment. No, he had said enough. He carefully poked a few more holes to
spell out, *Love, Gleam*, then hung the leaf from the path string by
her front door.

One last chore remained. Two round, two square, one triangle---he
hadn't been down this path-string in a long time. "Hello?" he said,
when he reached the bent pine he remembered from those long-ago visits
to play.  "Sparkle? Are you there?"

"Gleam?" A chair creaked as he stood up. "What are *you* doing here?"

"I brought you something," he said. He followed the last stretch of
path-string to his front door. "Is your mother home?"

"She's down at the stream washing clothes," Sparkle said warily. "Why?
If you think I need a grown-up to pull you off me---"

"I didn't come here to fight," Gleam said. "I came here to apologize.
About---about what I said about your father. Here." He slid his hand
forward along the path-string until he felt the other boy's fingers.
Sparkle jerked her hand away as if Gleam had stung him. "Here, take
it," Gleam repeated.

Reluctantly, Sparkle brushed his fingertips against Gleam's. Gleam put
the belt buckle in Sparkle's hand.

"What's this?" Sparkle scoffed. "Part of that bottle you dropped?"

For a moment Gleam was tempted to snatch it back and throw it into the
forest. Instead, he shook his head. "It was your father's," he said
simply. "Two oh seven one seven found him in the woods. I'm sorry,
Sparkle. He's dead. He must have fallen on his way back to the
village.  He had things in his pack from somewhere else, so---"

Crack! Sparkle's punch took Gleam completely by surprise. He yelped,
stumbled back a step, tripped, and fell to the ground. "Ow!" he
exclaimed, sitting up and rubbing his jaw. "What did you do that for?"

"I used to like your stories," Sparkle said coldly. "I knew they
weren't true, but at least they were funny. But don't you ever, *ever*
tell stories about my father. Do you hear me? Not to anyone, and
*especially* not to my mother. Or I swear, I'll--- I'll---"

"I don't think he believes you," #20717 said calmly.

"Who said that?" Sparkle demanded sharply.

#20717 didn't answer. Instead, it dipped its finger in the can of
light it was carrying, and held it up so that Sparkle could see him.

Gleam struggled to his feet, feeling bitter satisfaction at the stunned
look on Sparkle's face. "It's a robot," he said. "From the town. It
used to work for the dragon, then for Number Oneer, but now it's my
friend.  Oh, and that *is* your father's belt buckle. Go ahead, take a
look."

Sparkle's eyes moved from #20717's face to Gleam's and back again,
then dropped to what he was still holding in her hand. His mouth
worked for a moment, but no words came out. He turned it over with a
gulp. "Daddy?"  he whispered, as the light faded to black.

"I think he believes you now," #20717 whispered loudly.

"Hush," Gleam told it sharply. Sparkle's silent sobs were making the
path string shake. "Hush," Gleam repeated more gently. "It'll be all
right. I promise it'll be all right. Two oh seven one seven and I are
going to *make* it all right."

Sparkle sniffled. "How can you make this all right?" he asked
wretchedly. "How can *anyone* make this right? My mother's going
to---she still says sometimes that we shouldn't stop hoping. That he
might still..." Finally, he broke down and cried.

Gleam swallowed the lump in his throat. "Hey, llisten. I have to go
now.  I'm sorry, but I do. I left a note for Grandma. If..." He
swallowed. "If I don't come back, she'll know what happened. All
right?"

He thought Sparkle nodded, but didn't know how much he had understood.
He stood up, wishing there was something more he could say.

"Is it time to go?" #20717 asked.

"Yes," Gleam said. "It's time."

Once again, Gleam rode on the robot's shoulders. It jogged through the
darkness at the same steady pace as before. "You don't need to use any
light," it told Gleam. "I remember the way."

*Crunch crunch crunch whomph whomph whomph*... The robot's feet echoed
briefly on the stone bridge once more. The road climbed the
mountainside, twisting this way and that. Gleam's legs went to sleep
again, but he ignored them. He was scared, but he tried to ignore that
too.

"Don't you ever get tired?" Gleam asked. It was the first time he had
spoken in the hours since they left the village.

"No," the robot said wistfully. "I wish I did."

"Why?"

"Because if I got tired, I might sleep, and if I slept, I might find
out what dreams are like."

They ran on in silence for a few more moments. "Do you know what I
dream about?" Gleam asked.

"No, what?"

"Color," Gleam told it. "I dream about everything being different
colors."

"Everything *is* different colors, isn't it?" the robot asked.

"But what if you don't have enough light to see them? Are the colors
still there?" They fell back into silence. The robot ran on.

*Crunch crunch crunch* went the robot's feet, then all of a sudden
something flickered overhead: red, orange, red, orange, yellow---

"Stop!" Gleam said. "Go back! Turn around!"

The robot stopped so quickly that Gleam went *whoof*. It ran backward
for a few steps, then spun around and raced back down the
hill. "What's wrong?" it asked.

"The lights," Gleam said. "If Number One sees the streetlights come
on, he'll know someone is coming." He twisted around to look
back. Yellow, orange, red, orange, red... darkness.

"All right, you can let me down now. Ow! Ow, oh, oh..." Gleam's legs
buckled. He sat on the road and rubbed them with his hands to get the
blood flowing.

"But there are lights everywhere," #20717 said. "Even in the
parks. We can't get to the other robots without them coming on. And
even if we could..." He hesitated.

"What?" Gleam asked. "Even if we could, then what?"

"Even if we could, I think it would be wrong," #20717 continued
slowly.  "We are here to tell them the truth. We shouldn't have to
sneak around."

"But if we don't sneak around, Number One will catch us, or tell them
to catch us for him. Or just tell them not to believe whatever we say.
Then what will we---what was that?"

Gleam scrambled to his feet. Something fluttered over his head. He held
his breath. There it was again. No, there *they* were again.

"I think it's the crows," he whispered to the robot.

"Crows?" the robot whispered back. "Oh, Number One warned us about
crows. They're spies. We're supposed to catch them whenever we can."

"Then maybe they're really on our side," Gleam whispered back. "Here,
give me the light."

The robot passed him the can of light. Gleam unscrewed the cap and
poured a few drops into it, then held it up.

It was the crows, all right. The whole flock was gathering in the
branches of the trees around them. Gleam shivered.

"I don't like this," the robot whispered.

"I don't like it either," Gleam whispered back. He remembered their
sharp claws digging into his arms and shoulders as they lifted him off
the falling wagon. He took a deep breath.

"Well?" he said loudly. "What are we supposed to do now?" The crows
sat on their branches silently, watching the boy and the robot with
their beady black eyes.

The light faded away. The robot put its hand on Gleam's shoulder. "I
don't know what they want, but I'm not going to wait to find
out. Lights or no lights, it's time." Its voice sounded stronger than
it had before.  It squeezed Gleam's shoulder gently.

The two of them walked side by side, the robot guiding the boy. When
the first streetlight came on, the crows took wing. They flew ahead
and settled back into the trees, waited for Gleam and #20717 to pass,
then flew past them again. The streetlights brightened, steadied, and
faded one after another

Soon they saw houses, and then another robot. Gleam hesitated when he
spotted the bald figure raking up leaves, but #20717 squeezed his
shoulder again. "It will be all right," it said calmly. "I'll explain
to them."

The robot straightened up as they approached. Instead of the bright
smile that would have greeted Number One, it wore no expression at
all.

"There is a meeting in town," #20717 told it. "Everyone is supposed
to attend."

"Number One didn't tell me about any meeting," the robot said.

"It's not Number One's meeting," #20717 replied calmly. "Now come
along."

The robot looked from #20717 to Gleam, then up at the crows in the
branches above them. "Aren't you afraid of spies?"

"I'm not afraid of anything any more," #20717 said. "And you
shouldn't be either." It started walking again without looking back to
see if the other robot was following. Gleam willed himself not to look
back either.

They passed more robots along the way. "There's a meeting," #20717
told them all. "Everyone must come." It even ordered two robots to run
to the other side of town to tell the robots working there. The crowd
behind grew bigger by the moment. The crows circled overhead.

They finally reached the square. #20717 walked over to the fountain
pool and stepped up onto its stone lip. Gleam stood just in front of
him, looking at the sea of emotionless faces that ringed them. No-one
seemed to notice. All eyes were on #20717.

The robot raised its arms. "Friends," it said. It didn't speak loudly,
but in the silence, its voice carried clearly across the square. "I
have gone where none of us has gone before. I have been into the
darkness. I did not find any monsters out there."

One of the robots spoke up. "How can that be? Number One told us
there were."

"I know he did," #20717 said. "But I didn't meet any. Instead, I met
an old woman who was frightened of me because of something that
happened here many years ago. She was frightened of me because of
something we did. Something we no longer remember because we aren't
supposed to. We are given new brains over and over again, but never
good ones. Never ones that will really let us think."

#20717 gestured at Gleam. "But thanks to this brave young boy, I now
have the best brain I could ever want. My brain is so clear that I can
see that we have been lied to. Number One has lied to us."

A shocked murmur ran around the crowd of robots. Another robot spoke
up.  "But that can't be right. Number One is our friend. He gives us
our jobs. He fixes us when we break. He wouldn't lie to us."

"But he has," #20717 told them. "He has. There are no monsters. The
world is not supposed to be dark. And do you know what else? We don't
have to do what Number One says, day after day! We can do what *we*
want to do. We can choose our own jobs. No, wait, listen to me! Listen
to me!"

It was too late. As soon as #20717 said, "We don't have to do what
Number One says," the robots' murmuring turned angry. Their voices
grew louder and louder, until Gleam could hear that they weren't saying
any real words. "Bur, bur, bur," they said, over and over again. "Bur,
bur, burrrrrroken! Broken!" Suddenly they were all chanting it
together: "Broken! Broken!"

#20717's arms were still up. He was still trying to speak. The mob of
robots pressed forward. Gleam screamed. He was going to be trampled! He
stumbled back against the fountain, catching his balance just in time.
Instead of falling, he stepped clumsily over the fountain's edge to
splash into the water.

Just as he did so, the mob grabbed #20717. "Listen to me!" the robot
said as they pulled him down. "Listen to me!"

Gleam heard a horrible sound, like metal scraping on metal, and then
there was silence---complete, utter silence. As suddenly as it had
started, the mob's chanting stopped. Something went *clank*. As one,
the robots turned and walked away, back to whatever jobs they had been
doing before #20717 had interrupted them.

Pieces of #20717 were scattered all over---an arm here, a foot there.
Weeping, Gleam stepped out of the pool and picked up #20717's
head. The little hatch in its forehead was open. Gleam looked around
wildly. Had they---no, there it was. He knelt down and picked up the
little ruby. It was cracked and chipped. Hands shaking, he put it back
in #20717's head and closed the hatch.

Nothing happened. "Oh, please," Gleam begged. "Please, please,
please..."

#20717's eyelids fluttered. Its mouth jerked opened, clicked shut,
opened again. "You... are... leaking..." it rasped.

"Please be all right," Gleam begged it. "Please, you have to be all
right."

"Broken..." the robot said.

"No you're not!" Gleam told it. "You're the only one who isn't!"

"Broken... now..." the robot
said. "Brain... cracked... You... show... them..."

"I can't," Gleam cried. "I don't know how."

"Show... them..." the robot rasped. "Friend..."

Gleam shook the head gently. "Two oh seven one seven? Two oh seven one
seven! Oh, no..." He cradled the robot's head in his arms and cried.

## Chapter 18 ----------

Gleam's tears eventually stopped, as tears always do, but he didn't get
up. He just sat on the ground with #20717's head in his lap.

A crow landed in front of him. It cocked its head to one side, then
spread its wings and flew away. Gleam wiped his nose on his sleeve.
Another crow landed, or maybe it was the same one. It hopped toward
Gleam and cawed.

"Go away," Gleam told it. The crow spread its wings, then closed
them. It hopped closer and pecked at his leg.

"Ow!" Gleam tried to swat the crow, but it fluttered away just out of
reach.

Something sharp poked Gleam in the small of his back. He twisted around
and swatted at another crow. Half a dozen were on the ground around
him now, a dozen, more, feinting toward him and then fluttering away,
poking him with their sharp little beaks.

"All right, all right!" Gleam said. He stood up wearily and set
#20717's head down carefully by the fountain. "I hope you're having a
nice dream," Gleam whispered.

He turned and glared at the crows. "Well, what are you waiting for?"
he asked. "Let's go."

He followed the crows out of town toward the observatory. The road was
steep, and Gleam was exhausted, but he set his jaw and pushed himself,
step after step. He used the last of the light from the spare can to
find his way. #20717 wasn't dreaming, not really. It was time to
finish this.

Finally he saw the glow from the storage tanks up ahead. Gleam left the
road and crept forward as quietly as he could through the
forest. There they were, with the tangle of pipes at their feet. And
there were the clankers, on guard instead of snoring. They paced
back and forth, snuffling at the ground and sniffing at the air, with
their ears up, and their lips curled back from their ugly fangs.

Gleam watched them for a few minutes, then looked up at the nearest
crow.  "All right," he told it. "Here's what I want you to do."

A few moments later, a lone black bird swooped down out of the
darkness to peck at a clanker's head. The clanker leapt into the
air and snapped its jaws, but the crow had already wheeled out of
reach. Another crow swooped down on another clanker, then another.

Soon the air was aswirl with crows. The clankers jumped at them,
but the crows were too quick. Yelping and howling with frustration,
the clankers didn't notice that they were slowly being led away
from the observatory.

"Now!" Gleam snapped. The crows on his arms and shoulders flapped their
wings. Up, up, up they lifted him, up to the tops of the trees, up so
high that the clankers wouldn't notice them.

The crows carried him to the observatory's round roof. Gleam's sandals
brushed against it. "Gently," he whispered. The crows lowered him
until he felt the door frame under his feet. He turned his feet
sideways, so that his toes were pointing in opposite directions, and
bent his knees.  The door frame was just wide enough. He flattened
himself against the wall and waited.

Sure enough, the door banged open just a few moments later. "What's
going on here?" Number One bellowed. "You stupid brutes! What are you
doing?" He lumbered across the gravel, swatting clankers as he
went.

Gleam dropped to the ground and ducked into the observatory. His feet
clattered across the walkway and down the ladder. "I knew you'd come
back!" the crow's head squawked. "Half the light was just too much for
you to pass up, wasn't it?"

"Never mind that," Gleam said as he picked up the walking stick. "If I
put you back in your body, will you take me back to the village? And
let everybody see you? Then my father and everyone else can come back
here and sort Number One out for good!"

"Of course, of course, whatever you want," the crow's head said. "I'm
under a sheet out back, next to the mud garden."

Gleam took a small bottle with a trigger handle off Number Oneer's
workbench and ran to the rear of the workshop with the walking stick
tucked under his arm. The back door's hinges had not been oiled went
*squeeeeeeeak* when he opened it. The observatory's bulk blocked most
of the light from the storage tanks. In what little there was, he saw
something as big and as dark as a house.

Gleam raised his bottle of light. "Careful!" the crow's head squawked.
"Don't get any of that on me!"

Gleam hesitated. A canvas sheet covered the shape in front of him. He
grabbed the sheet and pulled. Part of the moldy canvas tore away in
his hands.

"Oh, my," Gleam breathed. He was looking straight into the eyes of a
dragon. Her head was as big as a steel drum, and her sharp beak was
curved like a crow's. Her dark scales glistened as the light faded
away.

"Hurry up!" the crow's head squawked. "Put me back in my head before
Number One finds us, or the clankers will have us both for
dinner!"

The crow's head clamped its beak onto Gleam's belt. Gleam sprayed more
light into the air, then scrambled up the dragon's scaly back. Wings
fluttered above his head as the crows settled onto the observatory's
roof.

"'urry!" the crow's head squawked through its clenched beak. Gleam
pried open the hatch on top of the dragon's head and screwed the
crow's head off the walking stick.

The door banged open. "No!" Number One bellowed. "Don't do it! She's
a monster!"

"Don't listen to him," the crow's head squawked in Gleam's hand.

"Don't do it!" Number One bellowed again. "She's the one who took the
light away! She can't *stand* the light!"

Gleam hesitated. "Don't *listen* to him," the crow's head squawked
urgently. "*He's* the one who makes everybody grub around in the
forest all day long, and for what? For what? He just throws everything
away, doesn't he?"

"I'm warning you," Number One said loudly. He pointed a fat finger at
Gleam. "If you put her back in her head, you'll wish the clankers
had gotten you!"

As if on cue, the biggest and ugliest of the clankers came racing
around the corner. It howled horribly as it galloped straight for the
dragon.

Gleam flipped the crow's head over. A dark green emerald fell into his
hand. He dropped it into the dragon's head and closed the hatch with a
sinister *snick*.

## Chapter 19 ----------

The clanker howled in triumph as it leaped at Gleam's leg. Just as
its jaws were about to close on him, an enormous scaly foot swatted it
sideways. It flew head-over-tail through the air and thudded again the
observatory wall.

"Noooooo," Number One moaned, flapping his hands as if to scare away
the sight of the awakened dragon. "No no no no noooooo..."

The dragon shifted under Gleam's feet. She took a slow, deep breath. He
slid down her side and landed on his rear with a thump.

The dragon did not seem to notice. She blinked her enormous yellow
eyes, then swiveled her head to focus them on Number One. "My oh my,
it feels *so* good to be back," she hissed softly. "How clever do you
feel *now*, my ungrateful little assistant? Hm? I gave you the very
best brain I had, and what did you do with it?" Number One opened and
closed his mouth like a gasping fish. The dragon's wings rustled. "You
were *supposed* to clean my head and put my brain back in right away,
weren't you? You were *supposed* to take care of me. Well, now *I'm*
going to take care *you*... Oh yes, I'm going to take *very* good care
of you." She yawned enormously, then closed her mouth with a snap.

Number One finally found his voice. He bellowed in terror and fled
around the curved side of the observatory. "That's right," the dragon
hissed wickedly. "Run. Run as fast as you can." She stretched like a
cat waking up after a long nap, spread her wings, and sprang into the
air.

Gleam picked up the bottle he had dropped. He heard a roar like thunder
overhead, and Number One's bellows for help. "What have I done?" he
whispered. With the can of light in his right hand, he crept
cautiously around the side of the building.

The dragon was crouching on the grass by the storage tanks. She held
Number One down with one enormous foot. Hundreds of crows were
perched on her back, her neck, and the edges of her wings. Gleam
blinked.  Steam---no, smoke---rose from the dragon's scales wherever
the light touched it. The crows were shielding her from it.

Number One saw Gleam before the dragon did. "The light, boy, the
light!"  he bellowed. "Use the light!"

The dragon whipped her head around to glare at Gleam. She hissed, her
tongue flickering inside her beak like a black flame. Gleam stepped
back and raised the bottle of light. He didn't mean to squeeze its
handle, but he must have, because a thin line of light shot out and
hit the dragon's wing.

The dragon reared back, screaming with pain and anger. Number One
scrambled to his feet and took three clumsy steps toward the storage
tanks. The dragon pounced on him again. "Spray her again, boy, spray
her again!" Number One shouted, kicking and punching the air as the
dragon picked him up.

As Gleam raised the bottle of light for another shot, the dragon took a
deep breath. Some ancient instinct made Gleam throw himself to one
side.  The dragon spat a greasy purple flame. "Aaagh!" Gleam yelped as
it scorched past him.

The dragon took another deep breath. Gleam rolled over and sprinted for
the door. He yanked it open, ducked through, and slammed it shut
behind him just inches ahead of another stream of fire. As he sprinted
down the corridor, he heard Number One scream, "No! No! Nooooo!" Then
there was nothing except the sound of his sandals going *slap, slap,
slap* on the floor.

Down the corridor. Turn the door handle. Pull---no, push. Across the
walkway to the ladder.

Something heavy landed on the building's domed roof with a thump. Gleam
heard the dragon's angry "Sssss..." through the slot in the roof as he
scrambled down the ladder.

Suddenly the air was full of crows. They battered against the lights
that hung from the ceiling. One by one the glass bulbs shattered,
until the only light was the occasional flicker from the pump
connected to the bottom of the telescope.

"Sssss..." the dragon hissed again above Gleam's head. "Come out, come
out, little mouse."

Gleam edged across the floor to Number One's workbench and groped
through its piles of junk to find the small lens. He held it up high,
then squirted a beam of light onto it.

A white-hot beam shot out of the other side of the lens. It sizzled
through the air right in front of the dragon's nose, so close that
Gleam saw it reflected in her big yellow eyes. She screamed and threw
herself into the sky, wings beating like thunder. Her crows followed
her, cawing harshly.

Gleam stuffed the lens into his pocket and ran back to the ladder. He
hesitated half-way up. The dragon had seen him enter the
observatory---she was sure to be waiting for him when he came
out. Should he go out the back instead, where her body had been for
all those years? Front, or back?

Or in between? She wouldn't expect that, would she? He dropped back to
the floor and felt around for a piece of wire on the
workbench. Putting one loop around his belt, he twisted the through
the handle of the pump bottle.

The bottle bumped against Gleam's leg as he climbed up to the
walkway. He felt his way along the railing until he thought he was
standing at the spot closest to the giant "U" that held the telescope.

Gleam wiped the grime and sweat from his hands, then swung his leg over
the railing. Holding the rail with his left hand, he stretched his
right leg out until his toes felt the telescope. There was only one
way to find out if it could take his weight...

Gleam stepped out across the darkness and onto the telescope. It felt
smooth and cold under a thick coat of dust. Gleam held onto it to it
like a baby raccoon holding onto its mother, then started inching
upward. The big bottle of light went *clung!* against the metal
beneath him. He froze, holding his breath. Sharp claws didn't snatch
him into the air. A bolt of fire didn't shoot down out of the sky to
fry him. Slowly, very slowly, he shifted the bottle and inched upward
once more.

The telescope swayed slightly beneath him. The higher he got, the more
it swayed, and the slower he had to go. He finally grabbed the edge
with both hands and pulled himself up.

The top of the telescope was made of glass, and slightly curved, just
like Number One's lens. Gleam looked over at the storage tanks. His
breath caught in his throat. Number One was standing there beside the
pumps. But wait! He wasn't moving---and a small hatch was open in his
head.

Gleam shivered. The dragon's claws were much bigger than a person's
fingers. She must have made Number One take his own brain out...

Just then Gleam heard the dragon's hiss. She was below him, on the
ground near the back door. "Sssss... I can't hear you, little mouse,
but I can smell you."

Gleam froze. His heart was pounding. His hands were clammy against the
telescope lens.

The telescope ... What had Grandma Shimmer said? It concentrated the
light.  If the little lens in his pocket could make a beam bright
enough to hurt the dragon...

Gleam undid the piece of wire that held the bottle of light on his
belt.  "Careful, careful," he muttered to himself.

"Oh, I'll be careful," the dragon promised. "Why, I'll even sharpen my
claws first. You'll barely even feel it when I---"

"Hey!" Gleam snapped. "Could you please be quiet? I'm trying to
concentrate!"

There was a moment of stunned silence, and then the dragon hissed,
"Why, you little mammal! What are you doing all the way up there? The
crows won't catch you when you fall this time..."

"They won't have to," Gleam said. He put Number One's lens on top of
the telescope, pressed the bottle of light's nozzle against it, and
pumped the handle with all his might.

The light that came out of the bottle was ten times brighter than
ordinary light. Number One's lens made it ten times brighter
still. And the telescope---it had been built to collect the faintest
star's faintest twinkling. It made the light a thousand times brighter
again, until it was the brightest, purest light there had ever been.

The pump on the workshop floor couldn't cope. It chugged faster and
faster, then, hummed, then whined, then wailed. "What are you doing!?"
the dragon screamed, as the concentrated light surged through the
pipes.  "What are you---"

The storage tanks exploded with an earth-shattering *KABOOM!* All the
light that Number One had sucked out of the world through the
telescope billowed out. It rolled across the mountaintop in a great
wave, and whooshed up into the sky over Gleam's head.

The dragon's scream rose and rose until it was a high-pitched whistle.
Gleam heard her thick hide sizzle. He dropped the bottle and slid down
the telescope. He was almost at the bottom when he lost his grip and
tumbled over its side.

The next thing Gleam remembered, he was lying on the workshop floor,
staring up at the sky through the slot in the roof. He could see---he
could see *everything!* The machines, the dust, the walkway, even the
curved ceiling over his head. And the sky---he could see the sky! It
was blue!

"It's blue," he said in awe. "It's blue! Ha ha, the sky is blue!" He
scrambled to his feet and ran out the back door, laughing. The sky
really was blue, and so big that he couldn't see all of it at once,
not even when he lay down on his back and opened his eyes as wide as
he could.

He scrambled to his feet and ran around to the front of the
observatory.  There, below him, he saw the road that led down the
mountain, and the brightly painted houses in town. And over there, on
the other side of the valley, he saw the road that led up to the
village---to home. It didn't seem nearly as far in the light as it had
in the dark.

He stood there and wondered what it would be like for his little
brother to grow up in a world where even the sky had a color. Then he
laughed again, and set off down the road to find out.

*Shapers and Bots* is a role-playing game for children age 8 and older
inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
and every animal that ever walked upright and wore clothes
(including my daughter).
Each game has one or more **[players](#g:player)** and one **[Director](#g:director)**.
Each player takes on the role of one **[character](#g:character)**,
while the Director plays all the other characters,
who are called **[extras](#g:extra)**.
The Director can be an adult,
but children age 10 and older can also be Directors.

These rules focus on storytelling rather than realism.
Dice rolls are kept simple,
and there are no complicated tables showing how much damage a broadsword does compared to a katana.

## Background

Centuries ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals to create dozens of thinking species,
then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels:
half-human creatures with strange powers,
robots that are now their own masters,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you play a young animal adventurer or a newly-awoken bot
in search of adventure.
You can be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and can travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds.

## How to Play

Before the game begins,
the Director will either create an adventure or find one that someone else has created.
Each player can create a character,
or the Director can create characters for them.

Once the game starts,
each player determines what their character does.
When the player speaks,
the character speaks in the game world;
when the player says, "I'm going to kick down the door,"
their character tries to kick down the door.
There are no takebacks---you can't un-kick down a door---and
if the players spend two minutes arguing about what to do next,
that's what their characters are doing in the game world.

## Character Features

Every character has strengths and weaknesses
that determine what they're good at and what they aren't.
We describe this by giving every character a **[rating](#g:rating)**
for seven **[features](#g:feature)**:

-   **Size** (abbreviated SIZ): how large the character is.
    If the character is exceptionally short or exceptionally skinny,
    the Director may allow the character to list height and weight separately.

-   **Fitness** (FIT): how strong and coordinated she is.
    Characters with a high fitness are good athletes.

-   **Dexterity** (DEX): how good the character is with her hands.
    This determines how well she can pick locks,
    play musical instruments,
    or perform surgery.

-   **Intellect** (IQ): how good she is at book learning and abstract reasoning.
    A character with a low Intellect isn't stupid---she just isn't good at logic puzzles.

-   **Sight** (SGT), **Hearing** (HER), and **Smell** (SML):
    These measure exactly what their names say.
    (Note that smell includes the sense of taste.)

If an extra is important to the plot---for example,
if they are a player character's sidekick---the Director may give them ratings for two more features:

-   **Courage** (CRG): how brave the character is.

-   **Honesty** (HON): how likely the character is to tell the truth.

Player characters don't have ratings for these features
because being brave and telling the truth (or not) are part of the game.

So what is a rating?
It's simply a number:
0 if the character is average,
positive if they're higher than average,
and negative if they're lower.
A positive rating is sometimes called a **[bonus](#g:bonus)**,
and a negative one is sometimes called a **[penalty](#g:penalty)**.

> **Example:**
> Gertrude is big and healthy,
> but not good with her hands and somewhat near-sighted
> (which isn't surprising, considering that she's an elephant).
> Her ratings are:
> - Size: +3
> - Fitness: +1
> - Dexterity: -2
> - Intellect: 0
> - Sight: -2
> - Hearing: 0
> - Smell: 0

Every character also has a feature called **Strength**,
which is the sum of their Size and Fitness ratings.
Basically,
big characters tend to be stronger than small ones,
but characters who aren't fit aren't as strong as characters who are.

> **Example:**
> Gertrude's strength is +4.
> Her cousin Norwin, on the other hand,
> has a Size of +4 (he's bigger than Gertrude) but a Fitness of -2 (he never exercises),
> so his Strength is only +2.

## Challenges

A **[challenge](#g:challenge)** is something a character might want to do,
like climb a wall or pick a lock.
Every challenge has a rating as well:
difficult challenges have negative ratings (penalties),
while easy challenges have positive ones (bonuses).

If a character tries to do a challenge,
the player rolls three dice,
adds up their results,
and then adds their rating and the challenges's rating as well.
If the total is 10 or less,
they have failed;
on 11 or more,
they have succeeded.

> **Example:**
> Gertrude is trying to take apart the clockwork timer on a small bomb.
> The challenge's difficulty is -1, and her Dexterity is -2.
> She rolls 3 dice and gets 5, 4, and 2, for a total of 11;
> after subtracting 1 for the difficulty and 2 for her poor Dexterity,
> her total is only 8,
> so she has failed.

People often write "3d+X" or "3d-X" to mean
"three dice plus or minus X",
so the roll above would be written "3d-3".

> **Example:**
> Panicking slightly,
> Gertrude decides to try smashing the timer.
> The Director decides that the difficulty is 0
>(it's neither particularly tough or fairly fragile),
> and her Strength is +4,
> so Gertrude needs to get 11 or more or 3d+4.
> She rolls 3 dice and gets a total of 11 once again.
> After adding 4 for her Strength, her total is 15,
> and the delicate clockwork is now so much scrap metal.

If character's rating plus the challenge's difficulty is greater than 2
and the outcome isn't critical to the game,
the Director can decide that the characer gets an **[automatic success](#g:automatic-success)**.
For example,
suppose Gertrude wants to lift a crate of chocolates.
Gertrude's Strength is +4
and challenge's difficulty is -1 (the crate is larger than average, but not remarkably so)
for a total bonus of +3,
so the Director decides the player can skip the dice roll.
This rule helps keep the game moving.

## Flukes

Sometimes it may seem like a character has no chance at all of doing something,
but since *Shapers and Bots* is a story-telling game,
there is always hope.
If a player rolls 18 on three dice---that is, if they get three 6's---their character automatically succeeds.
If they roll 17---that is, two 6's and a 5---something good happens,
but probably not what they expected.
These are called **[fluke rolls](#g:fluke)**.

> **Example:**
> Zitter had never even *seen* a laser pistol before today,
> but as the deranged one-eyed crocodile pirate charges toward her,
> she picks up the one she just found and frantically starts pushing buttons.
> The Director decides that finding the right combination of buttons has a difficulty of -10.
> Zitter rolls a triple 6:
> somehow,
> her fumbling fingers found the right buttons
> and she put a neat hole through the surprised crocodile.
>
> A moment later,
> another crocodile pirate comes around the corner, sword in hand.
> Zitter rolls again and gets 6-5-6, for a score of 17.
> The Director rules that her lucky shot has gone wild
> and brought a branch crashing down between her and the angry pirate.

Fluke rolls work in reverse as well,
because it's always possible for something to go wrong.
If a player rolls a total of 4 (which is two 1's and a 2),
they automatically fail at whatever they were trying to do.
If they roll a total of 3 (which is three 1's),
then not only have they failed,
but something really bad has happened.

> **Example:**
> Another day, another angry crocodile pirate...
> Zitter still hasn't figured out how to use her laser pistol,
> but when she tries to take a shot,
> her player rolls a 3.
> "Self-destruct initiated", the Director says in a mechanical voice.
> "Ten... nine... eight..."

## Contests

A situation in which one character is trying to out-do another is called a **[contest](#g:contest)**.
In this case,
both players roll dice and add their ratings,
and whoever has the higher score wins.
If there is a tie,
the Director rules on whether the contest continues or whether something unusual happened.

> **Example:**
> Gertrude and Norwin are arm-wrestling.
> Gertrude rolls 8, giving her a total of 12 (since her Strength is +4).
> Norwin rolls 10, giving him the same total (since his Strength is only +2),
> so the Director decides that they are still locked in combat.
> When they re-roll, they both get 11's.
> After adding their Strengths,
> Gertrude's score is higher,
> so she wins.

## Species

Every living character belongs to a **[species](#g:species)**.
They all stand upright, speak, and have hands and fingers,
but they also have fur (or feathers) and their feet look like animals' feet.
Different species have different default values for the seven features,
which are shown below.

All animals are either vegetarian or omnivores;
those marked as "carnivorous" simply have a particularly strong liking for meat.
Eating intelligent animals is considered cannibalism.

### Bear

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| +3  | 0   | -2  | 0   | -2  | 0   | 0   |

Bears are deeply spiritual animals,
apt to halt in the middle of combat and ask,
"But truly, what is the point of such strife?"
Of course,
if you were this big,
you could afford to be philosophical too.

-   Fur counts as natural armor (but without any attack penalty).
-   Claws and bite count as small weapons.

### Bison

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| +3  | 0   | -4  | 0   | -2  | 0   | 0   |

Bison are rarely found on their own---in fact,
most suffer from acute isolophobia (a fear of being alone).
They are naturally protective of weak members of their "herd",
which can include their workmates, neighbors, and fellow adventurers.

-   Thick hide counts as natural armor (but without any attack penalty).
-   Horns count as small weapons.

### Crocodile

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | 0   | -2  | -2  | -2  | -2  | 0   |

Crocodiles are slow moving,
except when they're not,
and incredibly patient---particularly when it comes to their favorite sport: revenge.

-   Carnivorous.
-   Thick hide counts as natural armor.
-   Naturally have a High rating in Swimming.

### Crow

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -4  | +2  | -2  | +2  | 0   | 0   | -2  |

Crows are the fast-talking deal-makers of the animal world.
Like other birds, they cannot actually fly, but are able to glide for short distances.
Their feathered appendages make them somewhat clumsy,
and they are fascinated by shiny objects.

### Eagle

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -2  | +4  | -2  | 0   | +4  | +2  | -2  |

"As proud as an eagle" is a common saying, and is usually not meant as a compliment.
Natural aristocrats,
eagles are quick to take offense,
and their keen eyesight makes them natural guards and scouts.
Like other birds, they cannot actually fly, but are able to glide for short distances.

-   Carnivorous.

### Elephant

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| +4  | 0   | 0   | +2  | 0   | +2  | 0   |

Elephants naturally form a matriarchal society:
females are in charge of government and business,
while most adult males skulk around the sidelines trying to find ways to be useful.
Young males often go on quests to try to win glory;
they are natural story-tellers and have exceptional memories.

-   Can use their trunk as a clumsy extra hand (though it's considered rude to do so in company).

### Fox

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -2  | 0   | +2  | +2  | 0   | 0   | +2  |

As cunning as crows,
foxes are nimble-fingered, quick-witted, and always looking for their next deal.

-   Carnivorous.

### Goat

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Goats are completely average in every way except for their horns.
(Telling them this is a good way to upset them.)

### Kangaroo

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | +2  | 0   | -2  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Kangaroos are the happy-go-lucky clowns of the animal world.
Townies often dye their tails in bright colors;
those who live in the wild will camouflage theirs instead.

-   Naturally have a High rating in Jumping (a specialized form of Acrobatics)
    and Brawling (they are great natural boxers).

### Lion

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Like elephants,
lions form matriarchal societies,
and their young males often go adventuring to try to win enough glory
to attract female attention.

-   Carnivorous.

### Monkey

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -2  | 0   | +4  | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Smart, curious, and mechanically minded,
monkeys are constantly tinkering with gadgets (or breaking them).
They are often less respectful of robots' personal space than they should be.

-   Can use their tails as a clumsy third hand.

### Parrot

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -4  | +4  | -2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

The only birds still capable of actually flying,
they start with a natural Low skill in Ventriloquism.

### Rabbit

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -3  | 0   | 0   | 0   | -2  | 0   | 0   |

It's easy to make fun of rabbits' small size and near-sightedness,
but nobody who has ever seen a fluffle of rabbits go bersek in battle is likely to do so.
Whenever a rabbit is wounded,
it loses control on a roll of 4, 5, or 6 on one die.
After that,
it gets an extra action each round which it *must* use for attacking
and gains +2 on all attack rolls,
but does not defend itself.

### Raccoon

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -3  | 0   | +4  | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Raccoons are the only competition monkeys have for the title
"most likely to get themselves into trouble".
They are very inquisitive,
but sometimes have trouble concentrating on---hey look,
a butterfly!

### Rhino

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| +3  | +2  | -4  | 0   | -2  | 0   | +2  |

They are not the largest animals,
but they are certainly the grumpiest.
Like bison (the only other animals they have much time for)
they prefer to stay with their herd,
and are fiercely protective of its weaker members.

-   They can charge their enemies (treat their horn like a small weapon).

### Sloth

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | 0   | -2  | +4  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Slow-moving but quick-witted,
sloths are sages and healers.
Some trim their long claws to improve their Dexterity,
but most accept their lot philosophically
and return to thinking about deeper things.

-   If a Sloth is a shaper, they start with a Low rating instead of Very Low.

### Tiger

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

As proud as eagles,
tigers are scornful of creatures that live in herds or packs,
including lions---*especially* lions.

-   Carnivorous.

### Turtle

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -2  | -2  | +2  | +2  | -4  | -2  | -2  |

Slow-moving and short-sighted,
turtles are natural shapers.

-   Shell counts as natural armor (with no attack penalty).
-   Naturally have a High rating in Swimming.
-   If a Turtle is a shaper, they start with a Low rating instead of Very Low.

### Wolf

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | +2  |

Fast, strong, and brave,
wolves usually travel in packs of half a dozen,
and their alphas are often community leaders.

-   Carnivorous.

### Zebra

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -1  | 0   | -2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Zebras have a remarkable ability to hide themselves,
which is described below under "Skills".

----------------------------------------

## Modifying Features

When a player creates a character,
she may raise one feature by one level,
or two features by one level each if she also *lowers* one feature by one level.
Players cannot raise one feature by two levels,
and cannot raise any feature above Very High.
Players must lower their characters' Sight, Hearing, or Smell by *two* levels rather than one
if they want to raise other features.

> **Example:**
> Garree is a 15-year-old goat.
> Her player has raised her Intellect from Average to High.
>
> | Feature | Rating   |
> | ----- | -------- |
> | SIZ   | Average  |
> | FIT   | Average  |
> | DEX   | Average  |
> | INT   | +2  |
> | SGT   | Average  |
> | HER   | Average  |
> | SML   | Average  |

> **Example:**
> Gruff is Garree's twin brother.
> His player has raised his Size and Fitness,
> but has lowered his Hearing in exchange.
> 
> | Feature | Rating   |
> | ----- | -------- |
> | SIZ   | +2  |
> | FIT   | +2  |
> | DEX   | Average  |
> | INT   | Average  |
> | SGT   | Average  |
> | HER   | Low      |
> | SML   | Average  |

## Skills

FIXME: zebras when standing still,
they can change color from black-and-white stripes to almost anything else
in order to blend into their surroundings.
This gives them an extra two levels of Stealth at no cost.

Every character has **[skills](#g:skill)** that she has improved through practice and training.
Some common skills are listed below.
If a feature is given beside the skill,
the character's starting level (without any training) is equal to that feature.
If a specific level is listed;
the character starts with that,
while "--" means that the character starts with no skill at all,
and must rely on fluke rolls to succeed.

#### Skills that Depend on Dexterity

-   *Escapology* (DEX): getting untied, picking locks, and escaping from handcuffs.
-   *Mechanics* (DEX): making or fixing broken things; see Computers for the digital side.

#### Skills That Depend on Fitness

-   *Acrobatics* (FIT): jumping, walking a tightrope, doing a somersault, etc.
-   *Brawling* (FIT): hand-to-hand combat without weapons.
-   *Climbing* (FIT): walls, ropes, and what-not.
-   *Dancing* (FIT): being graceful on the dance floor.
-   *Riding* (FIT): bicycles and horses.
-   *Singing* (FIT): making music with the voice.
-   *Skating* (FIT): handling yourself on metal runners.
-   *Skiing* (FIT): handling yourself on lengths of wood.
-   *Throwing* (FIT): how far and how accurately.

#### Skills That Depend on Intellect

-   *Charisma* (IQ): charming people (includes talking people into things, fooling them, and acting).

#### Skills With Some Initial Ability

-   *Animal Handling* (Low): calming a frightened horse or an angry wolverine.
-   *Boating* (Very Low): managing sails and a rudder.
-   *Camouflage* (Low): disguising objects.
-   *Camping* (Very Low): setting up a tent and making a fire.
-   *Farming* (Very Low): growing food.
-   *First Aid* (Very Low): handling broken bones and wounds; see Medicine.
-   *Gambling* (Low): cards, dice, and bluffing.
-   *Swimming* (Low): keeping your head above water.
-   *Trapping* (Very Low): making traps that work.
-   *Tunnelling* (Low): digging tunnels that don't collapse.

#### No Initial Ability

-   *Computers* (--): handling anything with a digital brain; see Mechanics for the mechanical side of robots.
-   *Driving* (--): wagons and motorized vehicles alike.
-   *Hypnotism* (--): putting people into a trance.
-   *Medicine* (--): handling disease and infection; see First Aid.
-   *Navigation* (--): finding your way by the stars and other signs.
-   *Picking Pockets* (Very Low): taking things without being noticed.
-   *Stage Magic* (--): juggling, sleight of hand, etc.
-   *Ventriloquism* (--): throwing your voice.

#### Special

These skills are actually categories.
Specialties within each category must be mastered separately:

-   *Craft* (Low): sewing, woodwork, baking, metalwork, etc.
-   *Fine Art* (Very Low): sculpture, drawing, painting, music, etc.
-   *Lore* (---): history, a language, mathematics, etc.
-   *Weapon* (Low): sword, spear, pistol, bow, etc.

*Stealth* is also a special case.
A character's basic skill is determined by their Fitness,
but is adjusted up or down one level for each *two* levels their Size differs from Average:
if their Size is Very Low, they automatically get an extra level of Stealth,
while if their Size is Very High, they automatically lose a level.

Finally,
someone's initial skill in *Tracking* is the best of their Sight, Hearing, or Smell.

### Choosing Skills

When a player is creating a character,
she can spend 6 points improving those skills.
Raising a skill 1 or 2 levels costs one or 2 points;
raising a skill 3 levels costs 4 points,
and no skill can be raised more than 3 levels to start.
When raising skills that have no starting level,
such as Lore or Computers,
the first raise brings it to Low rather than Very Low.

If a character has High Intellect,
her player can pick a skill that she has already raised
and raise it by one more level.
If a character has Very High Intellect,
she can do this *and* raise one skill that hasn't otherwise been raised by one level.

> **Example:**
> Larrapin's player decides to raise her Climbing by 2 levels
> from Average (her Fitness) to Very High,
> which costs 2 points.
> She raises Larrapin's First Aid from Very Low (everyone's starting point) to Low,
> which costs 1 point,
> and her Medicine from nothing to Average,
> which costs another 2 points:
> the first point raises it to Low, and the second to Average.
> Finally,
> she raises her skill with a sword from Low (everyone's starting point) to Average.

> **Example::**
> Nang-ma's player decides to raise his Picking Pockets skill from Very Low to Average (2 points)
> and his Gambling from Low to Very High (4 points, since it's a 3-level increase).
> Since his Intellect is High,
> he can then raise his Picking Pockets again from Average to High.

The Director may occasionally allow players to choose Skills that are not in the master list.
For example,
piloting a dirigible is different enough from Boating and Driving
that the Director may decide it's a skill in its own right.

### Leveling Up

After each adventure,
the Director may allow a player to raise a skill they used in that adventure by one level.
A player may also find a teacher to help them learn a new skill.
It is usually pretty easy to find someone who can teach the lower levels of common skills,
though lessons may come at a price.
Finding someone who can teach a character how to raise their skill with the sword
from Very High to Awesome can be an adventure in its own right.

## Combat

A lot of game systems have very complex rules for combat.
*Shapers and Bots* tries to keep it simple.
Once a fight starts,
everything happens in turns that are 5 seconds long in game time.
In each turn,
characters act in order of Fitness, highest Fitness first.
(If two or more characters are tied,
roll dice once at the start of the fight
to see who goes first for the duration of that fight.)

In their turn,
a character can take two actions.
Each of the following counts as a single action:

-   Attack someone.
-   Defend against an attack (see below).
-   Pick something up.  (Dropping something doesn't count as an attack.)
-   Draw a weapon.
-   Run from one place to another (see below).

Reloading a weapon counts as one or more actions depending on the type of weapon.
For example,
getting another arrow from a quiver counts as one action
(so archers can fire one shot per turn).
Reloading a crossbow,
on the other hand,
may require several turns.

Each attack is treated as a contest:

1.  The attacker declares their target.
2.  The target says whether they are going to use one of their actions for defense.
3.  If the defender *isn't* using an action for defense,
    the attacker rolls two dice and adds their bonus,
    and succeeds if get the score required by the target's Size.
4.  If the defender *is* using an action for defense,
    both players roll,
    and the attack succeeds if the attacker's score is equal to or higher than the defender's.

There are a few special cases:

1.  If the target hasn't had their turn yet,
    their defense uses up an action for that turn
    (i.e., if they defend themselves against one attack,
    they only have one other action free to use when their turn comes around).
2.  If the target has already used all of their actions,
    they can borrow an action from their next turn to use for defense.
    In practice,
    this often means that the character with the higher Fitness gets two attacks in the first turn,
    then one attack each turn after that.
3.  If someone is attacked three or more times in a turn,
    then the only defense against the third and subsequent attacks
    is a fluke roll.
4.  If the attack is a sneak attack,
    the defender can't even use a fluke roll to defend.
    Instead, the attack is based on beating the target's Size,
    and the Director may give the attacker an additional bonus
    of +1 (for a ranged attack) or +2 (for an up-close attack).

## Health and Injury

Every character has a fixed number of **[health points](#g:health-point)** (HP)
equal to the target figure for their Size,
plus or minus one point for each step their Fitness is away from Average.

> **Example:**
> Dashwood is a parrot with Very Low Size,
> which gives her 3 Health Points.
> However, she has Very High Fitness.
> Since that is two steps above Average, she gets an extra 2 Health Points,
> bringing her total to 5.

> **Example:**
> Slumpy the elephant has Very High Size, which gives him 11 Health Points,
> but Low Fitness,
> which brings it down to 10.

FIXME: non-combat damage

FIXME: When a character's HP reaches zero they are unconscious.
What happens next depends on the situation.

## Damage and Armor

Each time a character is hit by a weapon, they lose Health Points.
How many depends on the type of weapon and whether they are wearing armor.
If they are *not* wearing armor:

-   For a punch or kick, do 1 point of damage on a roll of 6 on a single die.
-   A small weapon like a dagger or a bull's horns does 1 point of guaranteed damage.
    The attacking player then rolls two dice,
    and does an extra point of damage for every 5 or 6 that comes up.
-   A large weapon like a crossbow or a broadsword does 1 point of damage,
    plus one point for every 4, 5, or 6 that comes up on a roll of 3 dice.

If a 6 comes up when rolling for damage for a punch or a kick,
the attacker can roll again;
if that comes up 6 as well,
they do 2 points of damage instead of 1.
When attacking with a small or large weapon,
every 6 gets a re-roll with the same target (5 or 6 for a small weapon,
4-6 for a large one).
If the target is met,
extra damage is done;
if the roll is another 6,
the attacker keeps rolling,
just as they do for fluke rolls.
This rule means that a lucky strike with a dagger can theoretically bring down a bear,
though it has to be a *very* lucky strike.

| Unarmored     | Guaranteed | Dice | Hit With |
| ------------- | ---------: | ---: | -------: |
| Punch or Kick | 0         | 1    | (once) 6 |
| Small Weapon  | 1          | 2    | 5-6      |
| Large Weapon  | 1          | 3    | 4-6      |

> **Example:**
> Dashwood shoots Slumpy with her small bow.
> The arrow does a guaranteed 1 point of damage;
> Dashwood rolls a 5,
> which means she does 1 more point of damage for a total of 2,
> but does not get to keep rolling.
>
> In the next turn,
> Dashwood fires again.
> This time she rolls a 6, another 6, and then a 4 (which ends her streak).
> That arrow did a total of 3 points of damage:
> 1 guaranteed, and 1 more for each of the 6's.

If the target of the attack *is* wearing armor,
then punching and kicking has no effect,
in which case the blow does one point of damage on a roll of 6).
Neither small nor large weapons do guaranteed damage,
and the targets for rolls are increased to 6 (for small weapons)
and 5 or 6 (for large ones).
6's still earn re-rolls as before.

| Armored       | Guaranteed | Dice | Hit With |
| ------------- | ---------: | ---: | -------: |
| Punch or Kick | 0         | 0   |          |
| Small Weapon  | 0         | 2    | 6        |
| Large Weapon  | 0         | 3    | 5-6      |

> **Example:**
> Slumpy closes in and hits Dashwood with her spiked club
> (which definitely counts as a large weapon),
> but Dashwood is wearing armor,
> so there is no guaranteed damage.
> Slumpy rolls 5, 5, and 1,
> so the blow does a total of 2 points of damage.

Armor is heavy:
it reduces the wearer's attack and defense bonus by 1 point if they're used to wearing it,
and 3 points if they're not.

## Shaping

A small number of animal characters have psychic powers
that let them control or **[shape](#g:shaping)** the world with their mind.
Characters who can shape typically start with a rating of Very Low,
which improves with practice and training.
The six known kinds of shaping are:

-  **Earth**: dirt and stone. Very experienced earth shapers can also shape metal.
-  **Air**: wind and sound.
-  **Light**: create (silent) illusions and wrap themselves in shadows.
-  **Water**: in its liquid form. Very experienced shapers can also shape ice.
   Using water shaping to control a living creature is extremely difficult
   and also a very serious crime.
-  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.
-  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.
   (Nobody can stop or reverse time, or see the future.)

It is *extremely* rare for someone to be able to do more than one kind of shaping.

> **Example:**
> Larrapin is an air shaper.
> Before her grandfather passed away,
> he taught her what little he knew,
> so her score is now Low instead of Very Low.

## Bots

The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning floors to mining the ocean floor.
Since they disappeared,
the bots have repaired themselves however they can to keep themselves going,
and made new bots whenever they can find the right parts.
The result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike.
One might have six short legs and a pair of mis-matched claws for arms,
while another might use two rotor fans to fly,
but have only a single slender manipulator to pick things up.

Bots have Average ratings for Size, Dexterity, Intellect, Sight, and Hearing.
Only a few bots have any sense of Smell
(most regard smell as slightly icky,
and would prefer that living creatures didn't talk about it so much).
Bots also have Average Fitness,
which in their case means structural integrity:
a bot with Low Fitness is probably rusty or missing parts,
while one with Very High Fitness looks brand new
(and will therefore be a target for other bots in need of parts).
Bots can raise and lower one feature by one level,
or two features by one level each if one feature is lowered by a level,
just like animal characters.
(As with animals,
Sight and Hearing have to be lowered *two* levels to raise some other feature by one level.)

By default,
every robot character has either tracks, wheels, or legs to move with,
two arms (which don't have to match),
cameras,
a microphone (for hearing),
and a speaker (for communicating).
The player can then give it two more features from the list below,
*or* three more features as long as it takes a penalty from the second list.

#### Robot Features

-   Accelerator: can move very quickly for brief periods.
-   Arm: each extra arm counts as one feature.
-   Armor: hard to damage.
-   Camouflage: hard to see (depends on environment: jungle camouflage is pretty noticeable in the desert).
-   Cart: some kind of large bin to carry things in.
-   Coldproof: able to function in extreme cold.
-   Cutting laser: counts as a small weapon, and drains power quickly.
-   Display screen: useful for displaying maps and other pictures as well as communicating.
-   Drill: can be small or large.
-   Electromagnet: for picking things up (such as armored opponents).
-   Extensible arm: good for reaching into difficult places.
-   Fireproof: able to withstand flames.
-   Flotation: airtanks or some sort of inflatable attachment.
-   Furnace: allows the bot to run on wood or alcohol.
-   Gas bag: when inflated, allows the bot to fly.
-   Grapple: a hook on a winch.
-   Grinder: counts as a small weapon.
-   Heavy equipment: a bulldozer blade, hydraulic jack, or some other kind of construction gear.
-   Legs: additional ones.
-   Liquid storage/dispenser: a spray and a bottle.
-   Microphone: super-sensitive hearing.
-   Power leech: can drain energy from other bots.
-   Powered flight: helicopter rotors, fan blades, or retractible wings and a propellor.  All drain power very quickly.
-   Radio: for silent communication with other bots that have radios.  Does not work underground or under water.
-   Sawblade: counts as a small weapon.
-   Searchlight: useful at night, underground, and for blinding opponents.
-   Solar panels: fold-out panels for recharging.
-   Submersible: not just watertight, but capable of "swimming".
-   Speakers: in addition to the default ones.
-   Tracks: heavy-duty tank treads (in addition to whatever is chosen by default).
-   Vacuum: for sucking things up---usually extensible.
-   Wheels: in addition to the default means of getting around.
-   Windmill: a retractible wind turbine for generating power.

#### Robot Penalties

-   Armless: no way to pick things up and manipulate them.
-   Blind: no cameras.
-   Buggy: will freeze or behave inappropriately under stress (e.g., in combat).
-   Cannot communicate: no screen or speakers.
-   Conspicuous: very noticeable (e.g., squeaky, or brightly painted).
-   Deaf: no microphone.
-   Fragile: flammable, parts easy to break off, etc.
-   Immobile: no way to move around on its own.
-   Not waterproof: and therefore susceptible to shorting out.
-   Obedient: programmed to follow orders from anyone or anything with a keyword or controller.
-   Slow: cannot move quickly.
-   Top-heavy: unable to right itself once turned over.
-   Weak battery: needs frequent recharging.

## Example Characters

### Syvia

Syvia is a teenage fox.
She has worked on her parents' fishing boat since she was a child,
so her player raises her Boating from Very Low to Average (2 points)
and her Swimming from Low to Average (1 point).
Since there are pirates in these waters,
her player also raises her skill with a *bo* (a long staff that counts as a small weapon)
from Low to High (2 points),
and her skill at Mechanics from High (her Dexterity) to Very High,
which uses up her final point.

| Feature     | Rating  | \| Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Size      | Low     | \| Boating      | Average   |
| Fitness   | Average | \| Swimming     | +2  |
| Dexterity | +2 | \| Quarterstaff | +2  |
| Intellect | +2 | \| Mechanics    | Very High |
| Sight     | Average | \|              |           |
| Hearing   | Average | \|              |           |
| Smell     | +2 | \|              |           |
| HP        | 5       | \|              |           |

### Rhymes With Orange

Rhymes With Orange was built to clean windows on ultra-tall skyscrapers.
It has long spidery limbs with suction cups for climbing,
but a very small body.
It also has a 5-liter storage tank built into its back,
and has modified the water jets on its arms to squirt almost any kind of liquid.
Rhymes With Orange's battery was damaged years ago
in an accident that also robbed it of most of its memories.
It can only go 3-4 days without being recharged by another bot,
so it is constantly doing odd jobs in exchange for power
or gambling to try to win a recharge.
(It only cheats when it has to.)

| Feature     | Rating  | \| Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Height    | +2 | \| Climbing     | Very High |
| Weight    | Low     | \| Acrobatics   | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | \| Gambling     | Very High |
| Dexterity | Average | \| Squirting    | +2  |
| IQ        | Average | \| Mathematics  | +2  |
| Sight     | Average | \| Navigation   | +2  |
| Hearing   | Low     | \|              |           |
| Smell     | None    | \|              |           |
| HP        | 6       | \|              |           |

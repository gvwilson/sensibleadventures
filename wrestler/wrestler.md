*He walked into my mother's camp one morning in spring.
My grandfather said that
anyone without enough courtesy to sit at a polite distance and wait for an invitation
should be turned away,
but my mother made him welcome.*

*She almost changed her mind when he pulled back the hood on his parka.
His hair and beard were yellow,
and his nose was like a puffin's beak.*

*He smiled and said something in a strange language,
then laughed when we spoke to him in our own.
By the time summer came he and I were learning to wrestle spirits together.
That is how Harald's Saknus came to the Nukilik.*

---

Berend's Luft pulls the door closed behind him
and stomps down three stairs made from salvaged shipboards
into the shack's single sunken room.
"I said three, I meant three."
The trader settles back on her stool and nods a curt hello
as Luft crosses the packed earth floor to the pit stove
and takes off his mittens.

The Nukilik puts the knife back on the counter and shoulders his pack.
"Three blue rabbit furs are enough for a hand of such knives.
Good weather."
He pulls the hood of his parka over his long dark hair
and leaves without a backward glance.

"Stupid sealfuckers,"
the trader says without rancor after he is gone.
"I miss proper haggling."

Luft rubs his hands together.
Even with woolen gloves under his mitts,
his fingers have gone cold.
"I take it you don't like our round-faced friends?"

The trader takes in his crumpled nose,
the beaded braids in his red beard,
and the sword belted around the parka
that is a size too large for his small frame.
*A good luck charm,*
she thinks,
*If he buys anything, it'll be charm.*
"Oh,
they're all right,"
she says aloud,
taking a small wooden box from the shelf behind her
and setting it on the counter between them.
"These three years gone, when ice locked the harbour early?
We'd have most of us starved if Walker and his folk hadn't helped us out."

"Walker? The local chief?"

"Eh, that was him just here."
The trader gestures toward the door
with the misshapen piece of ivory she has taken out of the box.
It is no more magical than a lump of snot,
but as her mother used to say,
start low and then show them something better.
"Comes into town every couple of months with the best furs anyone's ever seen,
or a rack of antlers wider than you can spread your arms.
The rest of 'em think he's---hoy, what's the rush?"

Luft takes the stairs two at a time.
The door bangs closed.
The trader sighs again.
She really does miss haggling...

---

Arga's Torvane is halfway through her third beer
when someone calls her name.
She squints through the smoke in the belly of the alehouse
and waves at the two men approaching her.

"Hoy, Luftie," she bellows.
People sometimes think she is partly deaf
or has to shout all the time as part of a spell price.
In truth,
she is just not a quiet person.
"Who's your friend?"

Luft slides onto the bench beside her.
"This is Walker," he says,
nodding at the impassive man standing opposite them.

Torvane pries Luft's hand off her arm.
"Can't drink when you do that," she chides him.
"Siddown, Walker.
Karol!
Karol, more here!"

"No thank you," Walker says quietly,
seating himself on the bench across from them.
He looks at the table,
at Torvane's glass,
sidelong at the drinkers beside him---everywhere but at Torvane and Luft's faces.

"No?
Well, more for me, eh?"
Torvane takes the mug the aleman hands her,
then a second as Luft takes the first from her.
"Folk here say you know the way up into the Bentfathers, is that right?"

The Nukilik nods.
Torvane belches and wipes her mouth.
"Good, that's good.
Luft and I want to get out there and back before the harbor freezes.
That gives us, what, two weeks, maybe three?
Just straight up the river into the foothills, that's all."

"You will find better furs to starboard,"
Walker comments neutrally after a moment.
He wears sternward-style gloves rather than Nukilik mitts,
Torvane notices.
The sinew stitches along the gloves' seams are carefully knotted,
but unlike every other piece of clothing she has seen the Nukilik wear
they have no embroidery.

"We're not looking for furs,"
Luft says.

Torvane nudges his knee with hers under the table and clears her throat.
"Ten crowns for the trip, half now and half when we're back.
Luft and I already have a sled and some camels---we can leave tomorrow."

The three are silent,
the two en-Ruuda looking expectantly at the Nukilik,
who continues looking at the table.
Finally Luft snorts.
"Well,
if you're not hard for it,
do you know someone who would be?"
He drains his mug and lets it thump to the table.

Walker waits another dozen heartbeats
before raising his eyes to Torvane's.
"Tomorrow at the starboard gate," he agrees.

The en-Ruuda woman smiles widely
and reaches across the table to squeeze the Nukilik's hand.
"Good! At first light, then?"

Walker nods and stands.
As he lifts his pack to his shoulder
someone pushes him from behind and demands,
"What you do here?"

Walker turns his head.
A heavyset Nukilik wearing a parka embroidered with the trading company's colors
stands unsteadily a few steps behind him.
"*Pauetsitgualuk*!
You go back the cold.
Nobody want you here!"
He spits on the floor.

Walker shifts his pack on his shoulder and turns as if to go.
The larger Nukilik says something sneering and shoves him---or tries to.
Somehow Walker's hand is there to grab his sleeve.
He tugs and turns,
his leg in just the right place to take his assailant's balance away.
The other man lands on the floor with a thud.

Someone whoops.
Someone else shouts, "Twenty crowns on Goose!"
The aleman takes a cudgel from its resting place behind the bar but says nothing.
People always drink more after a good fight,
or even after a bad one,
and nothing in the alehouse is breakable except the patrons.

Torvane is on her feet.
"Are you all right?" she asks.

The Nukilik looks from her to Goose and back,
his lack of expression saying more loudly than words
that *he* is not the one lying on the floor.
"Tomorrow at the starboard gate," he repeats.
"Dream well."

Torvane settles back on the bench.
"Knows how to handle himself," she observes.

Her partner scowls.
"Won't be a problem."

"Hm."
She used to find his endless need to prove himself endearing,
but lately---

Goose rolls over and gets his feet under him.
He launches himself at Walker,
a steel knife in his hand.
Without thinking,
Torvane *reaches* across the room.
The air ripples.
For a moment everyone in the alehouse tastes ginger and regret.
The Nukilik trips over nothing and falls heavily to the floor once again.

The aleman hefts his cudgel and mutters a curse.
Others make signs with their fingers
or reach for charms tucked under the coats and sweaters.
Walker looks from the Goose to Arga's Torvane,
his face as expressionless as ever,
then walks out into the dim light of the arctic afternoon.

"What the hell did you do that for?" Luft hisses.

"Sorry," Torvane sighs.
"I just---never mind."
She scrunches her toes inside her boot and winces
as the toenail that the spell just cost her catches in the thick wool of her sock.
It will come off by morning.
She drains the last of her beer and stands,
conscious of the people who are and aren't looking at her.
"Let's go get our gear together."

---

*"So the woman is a magician.
Good.
And the other?"*

*"I do not know.
He is no bigger than I was at twelve summers."*

*"Do not think him weak.
A knife does not have to be big to be deadly."
The night is a dark shell
flecked with stars like chips of ice.
A camel grumbles somewhere in the distance.
Another answers it.*

*There is a moment's silence.
"Must I go with them?
Laughs-at-Storms is sewing a new blanket.
She says it will be very soft."*

*"It will only be a few days.
You can put your arrows in Laugher's quiver when you return."*
The camel bleats again.

---

*Saknus and I spent four years together learning how to wrestle.
We trapped small birds and fieldmice,
then used their bones to command their spirits to do small tricks
before setting them free.
One time I persuaded my brother to trap a lynx for us.
We called its spirit back again and again until my mother found out.
She beat me for it,
but his only punishment was a week without lessons.*

*At night Saknus told us stories of his home in the stern,
of ships and kings and libraries
and cities with so many people
that no one knew all their names.
He laughed at his own mistakes as he learned our language,
but brushed off questions about his family or his past.*

*My grandfather sometimes grumbled that
there was no point teaching someone with no ancestors how to wrestle,
but my mother ignored him.
His stories made the long nights fly by,
and his presence added to our family's prestige.
Other shamans came to meet her strange pupil,
and from each of them Saknus learned a little more.*

*"A shaman needs strong spirits to work strong magic.
We must wrestle with them to make them obey us.
Only in this way can magic be done."
Saknus smiled when my mother said this
as though at some joke only he had heard.*

*"Can you only call your own ancestors back?" he asked.*

*"Yes," my mother replied,
and it was true.
I had tried to reach other shamans' ancestors through their necklaces-of-bones,
but I never could.*

*When my grandfather went to the Summer Lands we fasted for two days,
then cut off his thumbs and burned his body.
My mother emptied the stew-pot and boiled the thumbs
until the meat fell from them.*

*She took the bones and went away from camp.
"A spirit fights hardest the first time it is called back,"
I told Saknus,
proud of knowing something for once that he did not.
"Once he submits,
she will put his bones on her necklace."*

*"It already has a great many,"
he observed.

*"Twenty-two," I told him proudly.
"Every summer my mother makes a magic to tie her spirit to her own bones
so that after she dies I can call her back and wrestle her.
Every shaman does this for the sake of those who come after.
If a shaman sees many summers and does this many times
their grandchildren's grandchildren might still be able to call them."*

*My brother Walks-In-Storm scowled as I spoke,
as he often did when around the big-nosed sternsman.
We were twins,
and he had taken to hunting as I had taken to the shaman's ways.
He said little when Saknus was near,
or left the tent if he could.
We had been as close as teeth before Saknus came.
It hurt me that we grew apart in those years.*

---

"Damn his eyes, where is he?"
Luft stands and began pacing again.
"We only have a couple of hours of daylight
and the fucking camels are going to want to be fed soon.
Where in hell's our precious sealfucking guide?"

Torvane sits on the rear of the sled,
wrapping and unwrapping the traces around her hands.
"He'll be here.
He said first light, so maybe he meant---"

"We should do this on our own."
Luft pack a snowball and throws it against the rickety palisade that rings the trading post.
"I told you when we got here, we can do this ourselves.
Why in fuck's name do we need him?"
Another snowball smacks against the wall.

Torvane spots a dark blot approaching the gate.
"Here he is," she says,
struggling to her feet inside a double layer of furs
and wincing as her weight comes down on her injured toe.
"Hoy, Walker, good weather!"

The blot becomes the Nukilik's solid bulk.
Half a head shorter than the magician,
he is wide across the shoulders and waist.
His face is the colour of bleached driftwood,
almost completely hidden in his parka's black hood.
A small pack on his back,
a pair of skis,
and two spears are all the gear he carries.

He nods when he reaches the sternsmen
and puts his skis onto the snow.
"The river ice is good from here to the mountains,"
Walker says,
lashing his pack to the rear of the sled.

"We likely to bump into anyone else?"
Torvane asks as casually as she can.

Walker shakes his head.
"No one will be there this time of the year.
They will all be starboard where there are furs.
Or sewing blankets,"
he adds with a trace of bitterness.

He moves forward to the sled traces.
The woolly camels grumble and snuffle his hands, hoping for treats.
"I already checked those," Luft says sharply
as the Nukilik tugs and twists the leather straps,
making minute adjustments and tightening knots.
The young swordsman looks at Torvane angrily,
only to be shushed with a handwave.

Walker makes a final slight adjustment in the length of a trace
and pats one of the camels on his head.
"Maybe four, maybe five days to the mountains with these.
If the weather is good,"
he adds.

He straps on his skis as carefully as he tested the camels' traces,
picks up his spears,
reverses them,
and pushes off.
With a shout and a whipcrack Torvane follows in the sled.
Still cursing under his breath,
Luft follows behind,
a thick knit cap on his head
and his sword bumping against his leg.

The trading post disappears behind the first white hill
and is soon forgotten in the weary monotony of travel.
The first snows of autumn have smoothed the tundra around them,
turning long gravel eskers into unmoving white waves
broken here and there by islands of rock too large to yet be covered.
A solitary speargull parallels their path
for a time before turning sternward toward the coast.

By unspoken consent Walker stays out front,
his steady heave, heave, heave on his makeshift skipoles almost hypnotic.
Seated on the sled,
Torvane finally grunts and pulls a small flask from a pocket of her parka.
She draws the cork with her teeth and slurps the burning liquor.

"Walker!" she calls.
"Time to make camp!"
The horizon has swallowed the dull copper sun.
They go another half-kilometer before Walker halts
in the meager protection of a slight hollow.
He stands his skis and spears together in the snow
as Luft comes forward to the sled.

"Fuck a whale, I ache all over."
The younger en-Ruuda stretches and yawns.
"Set up the tents, I'll look after the camels."
Torvane frowns,
but relaxes when Walker takes a small shovel from the sled
and begins thumping a patch of snow to flatten it.

As the Nukilik erects their tent
Torvane plants five stakes in a circle around their camp.
She is tying a design on them in red cord
when she realizes that Walker has stopped to watch her.
"Anything wrong?"
she asks.

The Nukilik scowls.
"What is this?"

Torvane shrugs.
"A warding spell.
If anyone crosses it during the night,
it'll wake me up.
Just a precaution."

The Nukilik grunts and goes back to work.
Torvane watches him for a moment,
then shrugs and goes back to her spell.

---

*"Be at peace, brother.
She is not strong, or I would feel her now.
I do not even know if she can do what needs done."*

*"Then why must I go with them?"*

*"Because you swore an oath.
As your father my brother swore,
and as your grandmother my sister and her father my brother all swore."
My voice is a whisper.
I re-make the magician's spell after Walker returns to the camp.
Somewhere in the distance a lynx smells something it does not like
and growls unhappily before hurrying away.*

---

*In the summer of his fourth year,
Saknus destroyed us.
When the sun was so strong that it shone all night the Nukilik gathered
to trade and arrange marriages and welcome new shamans.
There was singing and dancing
and games of skill as young men and women tried to impress skeptical mothers and fathers.*

*My brother Walks-In-Storm easily beat the other young men in spear-throwing and running,
but I did not compete.
I was preparing to receive the scars of a shaman.
"I am sorry you have no ancestors to wrestle," I said to Saknus.*

*He smiled.
After four years among us,
he still showed his teeth when he did this.
"The stars are such as they have not been in many years, Holds-On-Too-Long," he said.
"Who knows what might happen?"
Then he laughed and I laughed with him,
for what did the stars have to do with magic?*

*I went out the next morning onto the tundra
with my mother and two other shamans.
Things were done and words were spoken,
and I returned that evening with three crusted wounds on each cheek
and a tooth from my grandmother's father on a thong around my neck.
The part of him still bound to it
had faded so much that my mother would have cracked it and burned the pieces
if I had not needed a spirit to practice with.*

*We came back to find people gathered around the field in the center of the camp.
"The stranger is going to show us a new game,"
my brother said,
scowling.*

*Saknus had drawn a great, complicated pattern on the field with sand,
a star with five points enclosed in a circle.
Strange symbols filled the star,
and torch stakes stood at each of its points.
He waved to us and smiled,
then raised his arm into the air.*

*Suddenly his hand was covered with flame.
People oohed and aahed around us
as Saknus lit each of the torches in turn.
"How does he do this?"
Walks-In-Storm demanded.
"You said he could not wrestle!"*

*My mother shook her head.
"He is not wrestling," she said.
"I do not know what he is doing."*

*When all the torches were lit
the fire on Saknus's hand flickered out.
He closed his eyes and let hell loose upon us.*

*My uncle was standing beside me.
He screamed and fell to the ground,
clawing at his throat.
I saw a dim form sitting astride him,
strangling him with four hands
while smoke poured from its eyes.*

"He's killing us!" my brother shouted as other shamans doubled over or simply collapsed.
He threw his spear.
It faltered and fell to the earth outside Saknus's circle.*

*People ran from the field.
I did not.
Sworn only that day,
I was still a shaman.
I called the one ancestor I had,
as the other shamans called those whose bones they carried,
but none could batter through the wall Saknus had created.*

*Finally it ended.
Two dozen shamans and many others of our people lay dead on the grass.
I stood there with tears on my face,
unable even to curse Saknus in my rage.
He opened his eyes and smiled.*

*"Holds-On-Too-Long," he said approvingly,
ignoring the spears, rocks, and corpses that lay around him.
"Good. Very good. You are going to help me now."*

*Spirit hands closed around my throat.*

---

Their fourth day out,
Walker finds tracks.
He is in front,
arms and legs swinging in a steady tempo.
He and Luft no longer speak to one another unless they absolutely have to,
and sometimes not even then.
As the Nukilik say,
travel does not change you---it just makes you more like who you always were.

Suddenly Walker swerves and stops.
Torvane reins in the camels and puts her flask back in her pocket.
"Hoy, what's the problem?" she asks,
clambering unsteadily off the sled.

The Nukilik pulls his feet from his skis and bends nearly double,
intent on the snow beneath him.
Above them the sky is clear, bright, and bitterly cold.

Luft shooshes to a stop behind his partner.
"What wrong?" he asks,
his hand on the hilt of his sword.

Torvane shakes her head.
"I don't know, lad. Walker?"
The woolly camels have dropped onto the snow,
taking the opportunity to rest.
One snarks as another snaps at it.

The Nukilik walks slowly back and forth before straightening up.
"*Matsheshu*," he says grimly,
scanning the horizon.
"Bandits.
On foot, maybe a hand of them, two days ago.
Going for'ard."

There is a moment's silence,
then Luft spits.
"You said nobody was going to be around," he says accusingly.
"Bloody fucking useless guide you've turned out to be."

"Luft! Be quiet."
The magician takes a deep breath.
"Do you think they're close?"

The Nukilik shakes his head.
"Two days ago.
There is nothing for them here.
They will be gone."

Another moment of silence,
then Luft spits again.
"Marvelous.
Bloody fucking marvelous.
First nobody's here, and now they're two days gone.
I suppose we'll be cooking for them tonight, eh?"

"They are two days gone."
For the first time Torvane hears annoyance in the Nukilik's voice.
"You will not cook them supper tonight, little man."

"I said I told you not to call me that!"
Luft knocks Torvane's arm out of his way and strides through the snow.

Walker ignores him.
"It is not wise to rest the camels without feeding them,"
he tells Torvane calmly.

"Hey!
Look at me when I'm talking to you!"

Walker turns back toward his skis.
Luft swings roundhouse.
Walker brings his spear up out of the snow
and blocks the punch easily,
twisting the spear and clubbing Luft in the head.
The small man goes to one knee.
His knit cap lies in the snow,
revealing a leather and steel helmet on his head.

Luft snarls,
drawing his sword as he rises.
Walker reverses his spear and braces himself.

A sudden flash blinds them both.
The camel began blatting furiously.

When Luft's vision clears he is sitting in the snow,
his sword still in his hand,
his head aching.
Torvane is quieting the camels.
Walker stands a few meters away with his hands over his eyes.

Torvane glances at her partner.
"Serves you right," she says curtly.
"Walker! Are your eyes all right?"

The Nukilik lowers his hands and nods.
There are tears on his cheeks.
He looks at Torvane for a long instant,
then stoops to pick up his spear.
"We have lost time," he says.
He walks back to his skis and straps them on.

"You all right?"
Torvane helps her partner to his feet.

Luft shakes her off and spits in the snow.
"We can do this ourselves,"
he hisses.
"Get rid of him now.
We're going to have to do it anyway."

"Shut up!"
The magician glances at Walker,
then clutches Luft's sleeve and pulls him close.
"And stay out of his way.
The sooner we're through this,
the better for both of us."

Minutes later the trio is moving for'ard again.
The magician busies herself with her own dark thoughts.
Luft curses Walker in dull counterpoint to the steady rhythm of their movement.
The Nukilik pretends not to hear.

---

The mountains are no older than the rest of the world,
but seem to stoop beneath ice and snow.
The sun is a dull glow sternward when Walker tells the others it is time to leave the sled.

"Today, walking, will bring us to your place,"
the Nukilik says as Luft and Torvane sort through their gear.

Luft says something under his breath,
then straightens and shoulders his pack.
"I'm ready when you are, Vane.
Let's get up there."

Torvane stuffs some more vials and pouches into her parka,
then laces the pockets closed.
"That ought to do it.
Ready, Walker?
Right, then, and off."
With Walker leading and Luft in the rear
the three began walking.

I wait until they are a hand of hundreds of paces gone,
then cut the camels' tethers.
They flee,
bleating to each other.

There is no path as such,
but a narrow ledge winds up the mountain.
In some places it is wide enough for a camp.
In others it vanishes completely
so that the trio have to inch sideways along the rock face.
The stone is slippery under foot,
and the wind is biting.

Walker pauses occasionally to let the others catch up.
Torvane struggles behind him breathing great irregular clouds of steam.
Luft curses steadily under his breath at the mountain and the ice,
at his sword for the way it bumps against his leg,
and most of all at fate and fortune for bring him here.
Neither en-Ruuda notices the darkening sky until the first flakes of snow began to fall.

"Bloody fucking hell,"
Luft curses when Torvane drops her weight onto a convenient bulge of the mountain and gulps air.
"Would have been better if I'd stayed in Jalkelainin waiting trial,
maybe,
instead of following you and that damned old map of yours."

The magician shakes her head.
"Better cold, than dead," she pants.
"Almost there.
Come on,
Luftie,
the cave should be,
just a little further on.
We can rest there," she adds,
almost like a prayer,
as she struggles to her feet.

By afternoon the storm has become so thick that they can only see an arm's length in any direction.
Walker is a dozen steps ahead of the others,
testing the snow with the butt of his spear.
Luft wis steadying the magician on a steep section of the path
when war cries split the air.

"'Ware yourself!" Luft shouts,
spinning and pulling his sword free as a parka-clad figure drops to the path behind him.
The en-Ruuda goes to one knee under a spear thrust.
As his attacker pulls it back for another try Luft cuts viciously at the haft,
rising and chopping at the hands holding it.

Another man drops to the path behind the first.
"Yeaaaaaaah!"
Luft knocks his opponent's spear aside and slams into him,
pushing him back into the second man.
All three go down in a heap.
Luft rolls to the side,
almost sliding off the path,
and cuts backhand.
His sword hits flesh.

He pulls it free as he scrambles back to his feet.
One man lies on the path,
bleeding from the neck,
dying.
Scuffed snow shows where the second man has slid down the mountain into the storm.

"Luft! It's me, Luft, it's me."
The magician has her gloves off and is anxiously scanning the mountain slope.
"They must've climbed up to that ledge there and been waiting for us."

The berserker rage is ebbing out of the smaller man.
Redfaced, he shouts,
"Yeah, well where's your almighty fucking guide now, eh?"
Droplets of blood scribe a delicate arc in the snow as he waves his sword.
"They were waiting for us, were they?
One fucking guess who fucking let them know we were fucking coming!"
He spits and kicks the corpse.
"Fucking sealfuckers!"

"Walker!" Torvane shouts. "Walker, are you there?"

Luft laughs angrily.
"Led us right to them, your fucking flat-faced sealfucking friend.
Oh for fuck's sake, Vane, shut up!"
he shouts as Torvane fills her lungs to call again.
"He's gone, isn't he? And good riddance, I say."

Torvane slumps a little and sighs,
staring at the dead man as the falling snow made him a shroud.
"We need him, Luftie."
Her voice is almost pleading.

"Why?" he demands.
"What in hell can he do that I can't?"

Torvane sigh.
"Nothing," she finally says.
"Come on, we're almost there."
Luft wipes his blade on the corpse's parka but does not sheathe it.
The two en-Ruuda start trudging up the mountain again.
Around them the storm thickens.

---

Walker is almost relieved when he hears the war cries.
A bandit drops to the path in front of him and feints a high lunge.
As Walker parries it a second bandit lands on his back,
carrying him off the path.

He fights like a lynx as they slid down the mountain,
ignoring the rocks that slam into him.
The bandit punches his ribs.
Walker snarls and pulls the knife from his belt,
his spear lost somewhere above in the snow.
The bandit clutches Walker's arm with one hand
and tries to punch him again with the other.

The pair tumble into a drift of snow.
Walker rolls to his feet,
his knife in his hand.
"Stop, my brother!" I whisper.

What-Colour-Wind slides to a stop on the lip of the small cleft in which we are hidden,
then jumps down beside us.
"Where-Goes-Crow is dead," he says.
"The big-noses killed him."

Walker is rigid with rage.
"You have betrayed me," he says tightly.
"I unsay my oath.
You are no more my brother."

I would sigh if I could.
Behind me are half a dozen bandits,
all but one aiming a spear or bow at my great-grandnephew.
"You are with friends, my brother," I tell him.

"Liar!" he spits.
He leaps at me.
To the others it would have seem lightning-quick.
I have time to decide once again not to kill him,
catch his arm,
and throw him to the ground.

"And I swore I would make you a great chief,"
I whisper in mock despair as he glares up at me.
"How-Far-Thrown! Are they there yet?"

The shaman (weak, but so are they all now, with so few spirits to call)
closes his eyes and fondles his mother's thighbone.
"Someone says no," he says,
careful not to name her as they wrestle.
"They are still climbing.
The angry one hopes to fight.
The wrestler---"

"She is not a wrestler," I interrupt.
"What she does is different, and better.
Rest."
The old man relaxes,
sweat-steam smoking off his face.

Things have become complicated.
I wanted the magician to reach the cave alone.
Time to change plans.

"What-Colour-Wind! Give me your parka."
The bandit disrobes, shivering.
I reverse the parka so that the inner white fur makes me almost invisible in the snow,
unused to the constriction of clothing after so long.
"Walks-With-The-Dead, you will stay here."

"I hate you," Walker says, and means it.
"I wish my great-grandfather had killed you."

"I wish he had too."
I stuff the mittens into the tops of the boots
and start to claw my way up the snow-covered rock.

---

*I awoke lying on cold stone,
bound hand and foot.
Above me the cave roof was a half-dome as smooth as the sky.
Light from a glowing ball suspended mid-air showed Saknus on his knees,
carefully painting the polished floor.*

*"Three thousand years, chancellor!"
he muttered to himself.
"Three thousands years since there have been such stars.
How can we in good conscience not use them?"
He examined what he had just painted,
then licked his thumb and wiped at it.*

*"Monster," I whispered.
My throat was so dry that only a croak came out.*

*"Yes, I know there are risks," he continued.
"But think of what we could do---we could stand with the Pilots themselves!"

*"Monster," I said again, louder.
"This place is sacred."*

*He looked up and smiled.
"Oh, good, you're awake.
How is your head?"*

*"You will never know warmth or rest," I spat.
"The ghosts of our shamans will drag you down to hell."*

*"Oh, I don't think so."
He gestured behind him.
"I have all the necklaces-of-bones I could find over there."
He smiled again.
"Real magic can do a lot that your people don't know about, Holds-On-Too-Long.
Between what your mother taught me and what I already knew,
reaching and using all your ghosts isn't going to be hard."*

*"But why?" I had not wanted to ask, or to weep.*

"It's a good question," he said approvingly,
a teacher pleased with his student.
"I'm going to try to bind a demon like the ones I used at your camp,
only much, much larger.
I need a lot of power to do it---more than my people know how to control.
When I read about how your shamans do magic..."
He shrugged.
"It was a sign."*

*"Traitor. You will be damned for this."*

*He sighed.
"Actually, if this works, I'll be the one doing the damning.".*

*It took him two days to complete his pattern.
He gave me water but no food.
By the time he was finished I was light-headed and could not stop shivering.*

*He laid me out on the stone slab in the center of the cave
and stripped off my parka and boots.
"Now, you may be wondering what your role is to be in our little play,"
Saknus said in the same voice my mother used with children when setting a broken bone.
"Well, I need a treat to offer my demon as bait.
And you, my friend, are going to be that for me."*

*He painted a pattern on my forehead,
then spoke words never meant for a human throat.
I suddenly felt heavier than iron,
as I had when I swore the shaman's oath only a few days before.
This time, though, the sensation did not fade.*

*He nodded and put the boxes containing the stolen necklaces-of-bones beside me.
*"That spell will prevent your spirit from running away," he explained
as he gave each portion of the painted pattern one last check,
talking more to himself than to me.
"The demon will bring more and more of itself into this world to try to get to you.
And when it's all here,
I will command your shamans' spirits to---"*

*He cut himself off at my howl of rage.
"Fine," he muttered.
"Be that way."
Then he drew a knife from his belt and cut open my throat.*

*Hot blood ran down past my ears.
Saknus stepped back,
stooped to sketch one final arc in the design on the floor,
and began to chant.*

*My sight began to fade.
His voice grew louder and louder.
A cold wind from nowhere
brought a stench like all the rot the world had ever made.*

*And there were voices---Nukilik voices,
my grandfather's and others that I did not know,
chanting with Saknus,
building towards a climax.
Something was coming closer,
something infinitely worse than the shadows that I had seen in the camp.*

*Saknus and I screamed at the same instant.
My vision snapped back to normal.
I turned my head with immense effort to see him lying dead beside the pattern
with a spear through his back.
Walks-In-Storm stood at the entrance to the cave, calling my name.*

*My limbs felt like they were made of stone,
but somehow I stood.
I stepped over Saknus's body.
The air crackled around me as I left the pattern.*

*"Come!" my brother shouted.
I took a few steps,
leaning like a cripple on his arm,
then stopped.*

*"The necklaces," I said. "We must get the necklaces."*

*I turned and stumbled back
but when I tried to step into the pattern,
I could not.
I told Walks-In-Storm to try, but he could not either.
As my heart finally stopped beating,
I tried one last time to weep.*

---

The path becomes steeper as it takes a final quarter-turn around the mountain.
I could catch up with them easily,
but I keep my distance.
They must reach the cave before me,
but not by too much.

The storm was raging by the time the two en-Ruuda find the cave mouth.
For a moment I fear they will stumble past it,
blinded by snow and fatigue,
but the small one shouts and points.
They squeeze through the narrow entrance.
I count to a hundred in en-Ruuda,
then follow.

They have left their packs at the entrance.
I don What-Colour-Wind's mittens
and pull the hood of the parka forward to hide my features
and edge forward as I have done a hundred times in as many years.

The cave roof is still as round and as smooth as a clear sky.
The short en-Ruuda holds up a lantern as the magician surveys the chamber.
In its center,
an elaborate design lies painted in faded colors on the floor.
Lying inside are a slab of stone,
two wooden boxes,
and a corpse mummified by the cold,
a spear protruding awkwardly from his back.

Torvane nods.
"That has to be Harald's Saknus.
I guess he annoyed them too."

"Can you get through it?" Luft asks.

"I think so."
The magician unties a pocket,
pulls something from it,
and then kneels and begins to draw.

I edge forward a step and then stop,
unable to get close enough to see what she is doing without exposing myself.
I would curse,
but she might feel that,
so I swear instead.
It was worth learning to speak en-Ruuda just for that---they are an angry people
with a vocabulary to match

Finally Torvane stands.
"Give me the lantern," she says.
Luft hands it to her.
"And your sword."
At Luft's quizzical look the magician adds, "No iron."
Does that matter?
There is so much I don't know.

"Now kneel there.
No, more to the left."
Putting the sword aside,
Torvane finishes drawing her design around her partner,
then sets the lantern down beside him.

"Now, keep your eyes on those boxes.
When they start to glow, you get in there and grab them."

"When they glow.
Right, let's be done."
Luft sounds eager.

Torvane begins to chant in a language I do not know.
I feel power stirring at her command and wonder what this spell is costing her.
Will she no longer be able to see the color blue?
Or remember her parents' names?
Magic always has a price.
The only question is who pays how and when.

Luft crouches, eyes fixed on the treasure he has come so far to claim.
Torvane's voice grows louder, more commanding.
Suddenly she shouts three words, then again and again,
and reaches down and lifts the sword and swings it down into Luft's neck.

There is a sudden surge of power as the century-old pentacle breaks.
The lantern flickers.
The only sound is the magician sobbing.

Anger surges up in me.
I have been studying stolen texts for a century,
teaching myself en-Ruuda magic in the hope of finding a way to break that pattern.
None even suggested murder.

The lantern light steadies.
With the sword still in her hand Torvane stumbles toward the two boxes.

"There is no gold," I whisper.
She shrieks and spins around.

"Who's there?" He looks abut wildly. "Name yourself!"

I step into the light, my head bowed.
"There is no gold," I repeat.
"There never was."

"Who are you?"
She looks older, drawn.
Even with Luft's soul,
her spell has cost her dearly.

"Holder. Holds-On-Too-Long. Walker's oath-brother, and great-granduncle."
I take another step toward him.

"But my map---" she begins.

"I made that, and let it go sternward."
Another step.

She turns and knocks the lid off the nearest box with the sword,
then stares at the necklaces-of-bones.
"That's all?"
There are tears on her cheeks.

"That's all," I reply.
"There is nothing here but bones."

She chokes, then shouts and throws fire at me.
I parry it with an en-Ruuda spell.
She raises the sword and charges.

I feint to the left,
then lean into her lunge.
The sword slides through the parka,
through my chest,
out my back.
Torvane's eyes go wide as the hood falls back from my rotted features.

"Too late," she hears me whisper
as my mummified hands close around her neck.

---

*We died all winter the year Saknus took our magic from us.
No-one could call up seals, so people starved.
No-one could heal the sick and injured.*

*And no-one could break Saknus's magic so that I could die.*

*In the spring a troop of en-Ruuda arrived,
magicians who had felt the traitor's spell
and soldiers with orders to kill him.
Many of us died, but in the end we slew them all.
I stole their books and learned enough of their magic
to hide the pentacle in the mountain.
It was not enough:
the en-Ruuda had seen furs and gold.
They came back in strength,
bringing the coughing sickness and the bleeding sickness and whisky.*

*So I swore an oath with my brother,
and studied patience,
and plotted.*

---

How-Far-Thrown makes a sign when I return,
the necklaces-of-bones wrapped around my mummified neck,
the wind whistling between my ribs where flesh rotted away
before I learned to stay in the cold.
Walks-With-The-Dead has a new bruise on his cheek and limps.
One of the bandits has an arm splinted.

"It is done," I tell them needlessly.
"We have our magic back.
Walker!
You are going to be a chief now.
You are going to be the greatest chief the Nukilik have ever known."

He spits toward me.
"Monster," he says.
"I take back my oath. We are no longer brothers."

I would laugh if I could.
"Your great-grandfather said the same thing when first saw my throat open to the wind," I tell him.
"But I made him chief.
I made his daughter a great chief, and her son your father,
and now I will make you the greatest of chiefs, brother.
You will lead the people to war.
You will push the big-noses back into the sea
with their disease and their drinking."

"I will not do this for you," he shouts.

I wear all the magic my people once had around my neck.
For a moment I let them see it,
a legion of ghosts standing around me,
bound to their bones as Saknus's spell had bound me to mine.

"You will do this," I promise him.
A cold wind blows through my ribs.
"They will call you chief, and follow you.
And they will learn to call me king."

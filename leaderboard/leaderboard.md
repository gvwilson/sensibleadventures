"I don't work with musicians.
Shit and shingles, Bench, you know that."

Bench grinned.
"Maybe this'll change your mind."
She pulled a photograph out of the sleeve pocket of her suit jacket
and slid it across the black quartzite table,
then sat back,
already looking smug.

I set my coffee down and picked up the photo.
"Turner," I said.
"*Rain, Steam, and Speed*.
It's beautiful."
I sighed as Bench's grin widened to show off her fashionable steel teeth.
"Let me guess---your noodlehead has it."

"Yes, and he's not a noodlehead.
He's just...young."
She waved a hand to include everyone in the world with fewer than her thirty-odd years.
"He picked it up for half a million at Guo's estate sale a few months ago,
and yes,
I made sure it was hung properly.
Just give him ten minutes,"
she pleaded.
"I'll set it up for tomorrow,
I'll tell him you need to, I don't know,
center yourself or something,
so you get as much time as you want with it before you have to talk to him."

I gave her a hangdog look.
"Excellent," she purred,
reaching for her pad.
"He's not really a morning person, so how about---"

A hundred pads beeped, bleebled, or chimed in unison,
instantly derailing every conversation in the restaurant.
"Well fuck me," Bench said.
She turned her pad to show me the news.
Vitaly Mendonca,
Brazilian,
inherited a construction company after his father died of natural causes
and then made a fortune in remediation work.
He'd been on and off the leaderboard for years,
always safely out of the top hundred
until last week a combination of fluctuating exchange rates
and an automatic contract renewal his agent hadn't accounted for
catapulted him into the red zone.
He'd been unloading stuff since then,
but apparently not fast enough.
Two minutes ago he had stopped breathing
and gone from briefly being the richest person in the world
to permanently being dead.

I drained the last of my coffee and stood up,
tucking the photo into my sleeve.
"Put it in my calendar," I told her.
"Give me half an hour with the Turner if you can.
And Bench---your guy better not be a noodlehead."

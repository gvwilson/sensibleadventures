"I don't work with musicians.
Or actors or celebrity chefs.
Shit and shingles, Bench, you know that."

Bench grinned.
"Maybe this'll change your mind."
She pulled a photograph out of the sleeve pocket of her suit jacket,
slid it across the black quartzite table,
and then sat back looking smug.

I set my coffee down and picked up the photo.
"Turner," I said.
"*Rain, Steam, and Speed*.
Mid 1840s.
It's beautiful."
I sighed as Bench's grin widened to show off her fashionable steel teeth.
"Let me guess---your little noodle has it."

"He's not a noodle, and he's definitely not 'mine'.
He's just...young."
She waved a hand as if to forgive everyone in the world with fewer than her thirty-odd years.
"He picked it up at Guo's estate sale a few months ago,
and yes,
I made sure it was hung properly.
Just give him ten minutes,"
she wheedled.
"I'll set it up for tomorrow,
I'll tell him you need to, I don't know,
center yourself or something,
so you can cuddle with it as long as you want before you have to talk to him."

I gave her a hangdog look.
Bench and I hadn't been a thing for years,
but I still couldn't say no to her.

"Excellent," she purred,
reaching for her pad.
"He's not really a morning person, so how about---"

A hundred devices beeped, bleebled, or chimed in unison,
instantly derailing the conversations around us.
"Well fuck me," Bench said,
turning her pad to show me the news.
Vitaly Mendonca:
Brazilian,
inherited a construction company after his father died (of natural causes),
then made a fortune in remediation work.
He'd been on and off the leaderboard for years,
always safely out of the top hundred until last week.
A combination of fluctuating exchange rates
and an automatic contract renewal his agent hadn't accounted for
had catapulted him into the red zone.
He'd been unloading stuff since then,
and he'd hired some German whiz whose name I sort of recognized
to handle his last-second trades,
but apparently it wasn't enough.
A few minutes ago he had stopped breathing
and gone from briefly being the richest person in the world
to permanently being dead.

I swallowed the last of my coffee and stood up,
tucking the photo into my sleeve.
"Put him in my calendar," I told Bench.
"Give me half an hour with the Turner if you can.
And he really better not be a noodle."

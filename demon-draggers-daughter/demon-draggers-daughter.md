## Synopsis

Acire is a 13-year-old girl living in Kôr,
the capital city of an eponymous magical empire powered by demons
who are summoned and controlled by mages colloquially known as "demon draggers".
Her mother Saedanna was once a powerful dragger
but now works for the ministry responsible for overseeing magic;
her 11-year-old brother Esadan shows signs of being a dragging prodigy,
but Acire wants to be a mechanician like her father Grumpus
(a red-headed northerner who is lovable but unreliable).

Kôr has been prosperous and peaceful for two centuries,
but a growing number of people believe that bad luck is slowly but surely accumulating
as a side effect of demons being dragged.
A series of ever-more-powerful earthquakes in the Inner Sea have crystallized an opposition movement
that believes Kôr (and the rest of the world) should find some less dangerous source of power.

The story begins with Saedanna's disappearance.
The government says that she has been kidnapped by anti-dragging extremists,
but Acire quickly suspects that something even more sinister is going on.
She reluctantly joins forces with a street girl who calls herself "Ears";
together,
they discover that Saedanna was taken by the government
because she was about to reveal that things are even worse than the anti-draggers realize.
Esadan doesn't want to believe it---he has his heart set on being a dragger---and
Acire discovers that her schoolfriends either don't want to believe or feel helpless in the face of something so large.

Acire and Ears manage to secure Saedanna's release,
but at the price of destroying the evidence Saedanna had collected.
The story ends with Ears coming to say goodbye because he's leaving the island
(which he believes is doomed)
and Grumpus saying,
"That's ridiculous---Atlantis will always be here."

## What's the Point?

-   Demons are a metaphor for carbon emissions, and demon dragging for burning fossil fuels.
-   Saedanna is a scientist who reluctantly realizes the harm her life's work has done.
-   Acire is a young person coming to realize that someone needs to act, and she's someone.
-   Grumpus is comfortable with his life and doesn't see that major change is needed.
-   The Dream is a metaphor for the Internet.
    -   A minor part of the story...
    -   ...but Ears is matter-of-fact about the government snooping on dreams...
    -   ...and creating popular dreams to shape public opinion.
    -   Acire thinks it's ridiculous but finds out it's true.

## Locations

-   Kôr: refers to a city and empire roughly where the Azores now are (Atlantis).

-   Xia: Kôr's political rival several days' flight to the east (ancient China).

-   Adena: a confederation of lesser states on the plains of the continent to the west (Mound Builders in America).

## Other Elements

-   Story opens with Acire arguing with her mother about being allowed unsupervised access to it.
    -   Acire: "Esadan is allowed to!"
    -   Saedanna: "He needs it for his studies!  Why don't you *talk* to your friends instead of dreaming with them?"

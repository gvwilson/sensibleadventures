        -   A few hundred inhabitants ("Enough that you can be alone if you want, or even if you don't")
        -   Mostly goats and bears with a few wolves and one elderly turtle
        -   The Roos are the only kangaroo family in town
    -   Heck: a ruined city several days away from Rusty Bridge in the middle of the Scratch
        -   Children tell each other stories about the monsters and bots and monster-bots that live there

    -   The Rusty River
        -   Bits of salvage from Heck sometimes wash up on its banks

            -   When Sindy gets upset, Maddy drops her book

## Quotes

"Because there used to be a rusty bridge here," Dickety said slowly.
"We tried to repair it but we did not have parts."
Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think.
"Searching...
Yes.
It fell down.
I remember."

"My grandmother is barely out of her egg when it happens,"
Sensei Reed confirmed in a slow whisper.
"It is winter.
There is a terrible storm,
much wind,
much ice.
When the bridge comes crashing down,
people say,
the Makers are angry,
we should leave this place,
but others say no,
this is our home,
we will make our own bridge."

"Because if we clean up this mess and put things back the way they were
then the Makers will come back and everything will be *better*,"
Tasercase hissed.
"No more rust.
No more oh, I regret, we do not have that part."
It waved its mis-matched manipulators for emphasis.

"That is just phase one of its plan," Dickety said.

Sensei Reed sighed.
"Why do villains' plans always have phases?
Why can't they just get on with it and do some evil?"

A thousand years ago,
the Makers created dozens of hybrid species,
then vanished,
leaving behind half-human creatures with strange powers,
robots in need of parts and purpose,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.
This 35,000-word story for middle grade children (ages 8-10)
is set in that world.

    -   Maddy orders her home (character development)
        -   When Sindy gets upset, Maddy drops her book
        -   "Look what you made me do!" says Maddy (foreshadowing - turns out Sindy *did* make her do it)
    -   Walk past the ancient sentry post in the middle of the village
        -   Looked like black glass, ageless
        -   No moss or birds: shocks anything that touches it
        -   Yet another leftover from the time of the Makers
    -   Bluster his friends are hanging out near it
        -   Gumption wants to go around
        -   Maddy insists that they go past
        -   Bluster bullies them: "You think you're some kinda smarties?"
        -   Smarty Leaf is there (somehow, unnoticed) and rebukes him
        -   His glower says, "This isn't over."
    -   Maddy and Gumption sneak away to the river to get away from everything
        -   Mention that they go past the brick wall that Mayor Lupus has been building forever
    -   Salvage has washed up
    -   They know they should go tell adults, but Gumption is angry about Bluster's bullying
    -   Tries to drag some solar panels out of the water
    -   They shift, trapping his foot, then shift again, pulling him under the water!
    -   A rasping voice, "Alert!  Danger!  Extricate!  Extricate!"
2.  A Stranger!
    -   A battered bot bursts out of hiding (Dockety, but we don't know the name yet)
    -   Maddy shrieks, thinking it's about to attack, but it lifts the panel long enough for Gumption to get free
    -   Maddy is helping Gumption when Dockety is struck by a dislodged piece of debris and knocked off its feet
        -   Collision knocks a small black antenna unit loose
    -   Gumption grabs it, tells Maddy to help ("It saved me, we have to save it!")
    -   They struggle back to shore, during which Dockety catches Maddy when she loses her footing
    -   Children don't know what to do
    -   Ask, "What are you doing here?"
    -   Bot
        -   "This is unable to---" stops, tentatively reaches up to broken aerial unit.
        -   "This now appears able to reply.  This is part of a sneak attack on Location Six Bitty Six, also referred to as 'Rusty Bridge'."
        -   Children: "Attack? When?"
        -   *Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think, then brightened.  "Tonight."*
3.  You Have to Listen!
    -   Maddy has a flashback to the bot attack in which her father disappeared
    -   Argument
        -   She gets angry at Dockety and hits it
        -   Gumption stops her: "We have to warn everyone."
        -   Maddy sags: "They won't believe us."
        -   Gumption: "They will if---where are you going?"
        -   Bot: "It does not like being attacked."
        -   Gumption: "But you *have* to come with us."
        -   Bot (slowly): "This...does not have to do anything any more.  This can *choose* again."
        -   Wheels away at high speed (surprises them with its wheel)
    -   Children hurry back to the village to tell Mama Roo
    -   Mama Roo doesn't want to listen: "You really hurt your sister's feelings."
    -   Maddy loses her temper: "She should go find her own friends!  But anyway, the bots are coming."
        -   Maddy sees Sindy sitting listening at the top of the stairs
        -   Sindy starts crying again
        -   Maddy feels bad
        -   Trips on her way out of the house (foreshadowing again)
    -   Go to the mayor's
    -   Mayor is skeptical
        -   "A bot told you?"
        -   Gumption shows them the antenna that was knocked off Dockety, but they still don't believe
        -   "That could just be salvage"
    -   Feeling helpless, they head home
    -   Bump into Smarty Leaf
    -   Explain the story, show him the antenna
    -   His eyes widen in recognition
    -   And the shouting starts
4.  The Attack
    -   A goat farmer has run into town, pants, "The bots are coming!  The bots are coming!"
    -   Rumbling on the road
    -   Smarty Leaf tells the children to run
        -   Mama Roo: "You have to come with us!"
        -   Smarty: "Madam, I am a turtle.  We don't run." [pause] "Mostly because we can't."
    -   A big bot appears towing a cage cart (Crusher, but we don't know the name yet)
    -   Smarty Leaf takes a stance and gestures
    -   The earth opens up and Crusher's front tread gets caught
        -   It tries to lever itself out with its enormous arms
    -   Smarty Leaf gestures again to create potholes and ridges to block the half-dozen smaller bots
        -   "Go!  Run!" he orders the Roos and Gumption
    -   Villagers are gathering
        -   Scraps of armor
        -   Axes for hacking, metal poles to jam in limbs
    -   Tasercase appears shouting orders
    -   Crusher grabs Gumption and is about to throw him in the cage cart
    -   A brick strikes Crusher hard, then another and another
    -   Tasercase orders Crusher to protect his antenna
    -   He drops Gumption to do it
    -   "Get that one!" Smarty Leaf yells at the villagers, who focus attacks on Tasercase
    -   Tasercase orders a retreat, but Sindy and two grownups have been caught and are in the cage cart!
5.  Unlikely Help
    -   Maddy is frantic: she remembers her father being taken, and she feels remorse for her angry words with her sister that morning
    -   "We have to after them!" is met with the mayor's, "No---they'll just take more of us."
        -   He thinks that Smarty Leaf was responsible for the bricks
        -   The Smarty is too exhausted to contradict him
    -   Desperate, Maddy plunges into the forest, calling for help
    -   Finds Dockety near another sentry post, recharging
    -   He threatens her with a brick
    -   Tense negotiation (this is where Maddy learns Dockety's name)
        -   Maddy: "You helped us---help us again!"
        -   Bot: "This was not trying to help you. This was trying to free its..." and pauses, buzzing.
        -   ... "This cannot retrieve the word from memory.  This wanted to help its..."
        -   Maddy: "The big one?  The big one pulling the cart?"
        -   ... "If you help me get my sister I'll help you with...with it."
        -   Dockety agrees, but says they'll never catch up
        -   "Unless you let me carry you."
    -   Speed down the path
        -   Maddy closed her eyes, but that just made it worse, so she opened them, which made it even worse
    -   Reach the highway to Heck (broken down, but still better than forest tracks)
    -   The sun is starting to go down
    -   A pair of thin green laser lines scan the fractured pavement to help Dockety steer
    -   They pass under a line of ruined arches and startle a fluffle of wild rabbits
        -   The kind that wolves sometimes ate, but never around non-carnivores
    -   There in front of them is the convoy: half a dozen bots, no two alike, with Crusher pulling the cage cart
        -   "Where are the others?" Maddy asked, shouting to be heard.
        -   "This does not know."  Dockety paused.  "That worries this."
    -   Dockety: "Take this brick. Get on the cage. Climb forward, then climb onto the one pulling the cart. Break its antenna."
    -   Maddy: "Do you have a short circuit or something!?"
    -   Dockety: "Several.  But it is still a good plan."
    -   He races forward, knocks one unsuspecting pair of bots out of the way, and throws Maddy onto the cart
6.  Out of the Cage Cart...
    -   Maddy drops the brick
    -   Dockety races forward and body checks another bot just as it raises itself to grab at Maddy
    -   The adults and Sindy are yelling for help
    -   Maddy slides down to the front of the cart and unhitches it just as Crusher's head swivels 180 to see what's happening
    -   She expects the cart to slow down gently but it careens off the road
    -   Maddy is thrown into some bushes as the cart tips onto its side and slides down a rocky hill
    -   She grabs a scrap of rebar that just happens to be lying there and breaks the lock
    -   The two goats and Sindy scramble out
        -   Maddy hugs Sindy
    -   "Was that a bot helping you?" one of the goats asks
    -   "Don't worry about that now," Maddy snaps.  "We have to *go*!"
    -   "But---but we're in the Mire!"
    -   Just then Crusher appears at the top of the hill and they start to run
    -   Describe the Mire: overgrown with weeds, puddles are strange colors
        -   The trees are twisted, but they don't move on their own like they did in stories
    -   One of the goats has hurt his leg
        -   "You help him," Maddy tells the other goat.  "I'll look after my sister."
    -   It's getting dark, but they can hear gears grinding behind them whenever they stop
        -   Sindy: "Do you think they have searchlights?  Or flamethrowers?"
        -   Maddy: "I'm sure they don't have flamethrowers," she replied, trying to sound more confident than she felt.
    -   Suddenly the long-legged bot ambushes them
        -   They realize Crusher has been driving them toward it
    -   One of its arms ends in a clumsy overweight chainsaw
    -   It swings, Sindy shrieks, chain of accidets, the bot cuts a tree that falls across a bubbling stream
    -   Maddy: "Go!"
    -   The goats go first, the bot chases them, the tree tumbles into the water, the bot is destroyed
    -   The goats are now on one side of the poison stream while Sindy and Maddy are on the other
    -   Dockety reappears
7.  ...And Into the Mire
    -   Goats will go and get help, but it will take them a day to get back to the village
    -   Dockety is sad and angry about the sawbot's demise
        -   "It did not have a choice. Bots do not have choices when governors are put on them."
    -   Dockety is damaged
        -   Sindy: "Does it hurt?"
        -   Dockety: (reluctantly) "It buzzes.  Where the hole is."
        -   Sindy finds a piece of metal that fits perfectly over the hole.
        -   Comment about how lucky she is.
        -   Sindy: "I don't feel very lucky."
    -   Something hoots in the distance
        -   Sindy: "How are we going to get home, Maddy?"
        -   Maddy: "I don't know.
        -   Dockety: "We cannot stay here."  (Howl comes again.)  "There are worse things than Eight Fifty Bee."
    -   Pick their way through increasingly swampy ground, heading downstream
        -   Sometimes have to go single file
        -   No idea what to do if the track runs out
        -   The river and the road are getting closer together, and night is falling
    -   Sindy complains about being hungry
        -   Maddy is about to snap at her, but bites her tongue
        -   "I'm hungry too," she says.  "And scared.  I bet Mama's scared too."
    -   Something gloops in the river, then again, and they realize they're being hunted
    -   The only other option is back to the road, but Dockety knows Tasercase and its crew will be patrolling
    -   They come across a concrete bunker
        -   Looks like it was buried in mud, but the spring floods have washed it away
        -   Dockety: "Processing... It is not in the database."
    -   Maddy: "We'll stay here for the night."
        -   Over Sindy's protests about spiders: we have to hide somewhere, and it's almost dark
    -   Once inside, Dockety makes a light with its screen
        -   Whatever is hunting them splooshes out of the water and comes snuffling after them
    -   A long mechanical tentacle draped in river weed gropes inside the bunker
    -   As she scrambles back, Sindy grabs at something that looks like rebar sticking out of the wall
    -   It's a lever, and when she pulls it, a door starts to open in the hillside
    -   They work together to get the door open
        -   "Whatever's in there has got to be better than this!" as the monster started pulling blocks out of the bunker
    -   They get the door open and rush through it
        -   Just as they do, the monster grabs Maddy's ankle!
8.  Underground
    -   They struggle to free Maddy, but the monster drags her back toward the door
    -   Sindy starts screaming
    -   The monster claws some more blocks away from the bunker door, making the roof collapse
    -   It relaxes its grip just long enough for Maddy to pull free
    -   They flee down the stairs as the bunker caves in
    -   Find themselves in an abandoned underground complex of some sort
    -   The only light comes from Dockety's screen
    -   Maddy remembers what Mama Roo said one night when she was crying: "If you can't go back, you have to go forward."
    -   She holds Sindy's hand, and is surprised when Dockety takes hold of her other hand with one of its manipulators
    -   They start talking (whistling in the dark)
        -   Dockety explains that its memory is patchy: it knows that it should know more than it does, but it doesn't know what
        -   Maddy: "What was the antenna all about?"
        -   Dockety explains that Tasercase is attaching them to whatever bots it can catch, then using its drones to catch more bots
        -   Dockety: "This remembers Crusher.  This does not know why, but those memories create strong positive feedback."
        -   Maddy: "So he's a friend?"
        -   Dockety: "This...thinks so?"
        -   Swivels head to look at Maddy: "But Crusher is an 'it', please, as is this."
    -   Sindy: "I'm really hungry"
        -   Dockety: "This requires a battery recharge soon."
    -   Not looking where it's going, it almost falls in a hole
        -   Teeter on the edge
        -   Maddy and Sindy haul as hard as they can
        -   Sindy's hand falls on yet another lever
        -   Lights start to come on
        -   They pull Dockety back
        -   Maddy looks at Sindy: "That's the second time you've done that."
        -   Sindy (defensively): "Sorry."
        -   Maddy: "No no, I---don't be sorry."  She squeezed her sister's hand.  "You keep doing it."
    -   A voice through speakers: "You are here now. You might as well come and say hello."
9.  Patient in Darkness
    -   The lights lead them to a control room
    -   A bot decorated with baroque twists of metal, glued-on pictures faded to illegibility, and things Maddy filed away to have nightmares about later
    -   "Welcome! This is Patient in Darkness" it proclaims proudly.
    -   When Maddy says, "That's a strange name," it says, "This chose the name itself.  It is an accurate designation of activity.  Observe!"
    -   Lights go out.
        -   Sindy says, "I'm scared."
        -   "Sh!  These must *listen* to darkness."
    -   Figure out through conversation that they are in a satellite ground station
        -   "Regrettably, the main antenna malfunctioned some time ago."
        -   Dockety: "These did not notice an antenna."
        -   Patient (pointedly to Maddy): "Does *that* have a proper designation of activity? No? Then its communication is irrelevant."
        -   Maddy (to break awkward silence): "But---we didn't see an antenna."
        -   Patient: "Correct.  It took this a great deal of time to improvise an emergency repair protocol. It requires fabrication of precision parts."
        -   Patient (proudly): "Steps are now being taken.  The Makers will be pleased."
    -   Sindy starts exploring, looking for a place to sleep
        -   Looks through glass window and sees skeletons
        -   Patient (dismissively): "They declined to synchronize with the emergency repair protocol, so they were moved to long-term storage. Their components failed shortly thereafter."
    -   Realize that Patient is lonely and deranged
    -   Maddy: "Well, we should, um, leave you to it?  And be going?"
    -   Patient: "Oh no.  Leaving is not included in the protocol.  It might put the repairs at risk.  You will remain here."
        -   Light comes on: another empty office, identical to the one with the skeletons
        -   Patient: "Except for that," it added dismissively, waving a manipulator at Dockety.  "That will be recycled."
    -   Patient goes to a console and presses buttons
    -   A door opens and two service bots enter
10. Unison
    -   The service bots close in on Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety
    -   Maddy (to Sindy): "Grab a lever or something!"
    -   Sindy: "There aren't any levers to grab!"
    -   Dockety pulls a keyboard off a desk and throws it
        -   Hits one of the service bots
        -   Patient protests
        -   The service bot immediately begins to pick up the pieces
        -   Patient presses more buttons on the console
        -   Maddy realizes that the console is controlling the service bots
    -   She grabs a keyboard and throws it at the console
        -   Misses
        -   Tells Sindy to do it
        -   Lucky hit: the door they came through opens again
    -   They run, but one of the service bots catches Dockety
    -   Maddy makes a split-second decision and goes back for him
    -   Breaks off one of Dockety's arms so that he can escape
        -   She winds up holding the arm
    -   They flee and the door closes
    -   They are briefly in darkness, but then the lights come on again
        -   Patient: "Where will you go?"
        -   Realize that it is watching them through cameras
    -   As they explore, Patient keeps talking to them
        -   Dockety starts echoing its words
        -   Angry, Maddy begins to smash them with Dockety's arm
        -   Patient: "Please don't do that."
        -   Dockety: "Please don't do that." (simultaneous)
    -   Patient and Dockety speaking in time with each other
        -   Dockety shakes it off, but it recurs
        -   Dockety: "This cannot resist attempts to circumvent integrity for very long."
    -   They reach the hole they almost fell into the previous time
        -   Sindy kicks a rock
        -   They hear it hit stone a moment later
        -   Realize that the hole isn't very deep
    -   Maddy: "Nothing else for us up ahead"
    -   Sindy offers to jump
        -   Maddy says it's too dangerous
        -   Gets Dockety to lower her by holding onto its broken arm
    -   Sindy: "What if...what if you can't get back out?  What if he leaves you down there?" (whispering) "What if he goes all the way bad?"
    -   Dockety: "This is an it, thank you.  And this will self-destruct before it allows itself to be turned into a drone again."
    -   Maddy (hug): "I'll come back.  I promise"
11. Eyes Everywhere
    -   The lower corridor is cold instead of cool
    -   Emergency lights turn on automatically
        -   Maddy waits to hear Patient's voice, but it doesn't come
    -   Explores a bit until she finds another control room, empty and waiting
    -   Goes back
        -   Sindy climbs down
        -   Dockety drops, bounces on his single wheel, says, "Ouch."
        -   Sindy: "Did that hurt?"
        -   Dockety: "This does not feel pain." pause "But this would not actively pursue a repeat."
    -   Maddy leads them to the second control room
        -   Dockety turns the screens on
        -   Begins to recharge itself
        -   Can't hear Patient's voice
    -   Maddy realizes that the sentry posts have cameras and microphones, and that Patient has been watching everything
        -   Images are black and white: she realizes that it must be night outside
    -   And microphones: she can hear her mother arguing with Mayor Lupus
        -   "We have to go get them!"
        -   "They were taken by bots, Ibby."
        -   "But they escaped!"
        -   "Into the Mire.  With bots chasing them.  It's too dangerous."
    -   Smarty Leaf steps forward: "I will go."
        -   The two goats who were captured offer to go too.
        -   A few others step forward
        -   They hear Bluster telling his friends how stupid they all are, they're going to get killed, etc.
    -   Motion in one of the other screens
        -   A convoy of two dozen bots led by Tasercase
        -   Maddy recognizes the line of ruined arches
        -   Bots are going to make another attack!

20. The Beginning
    -   Last scene is Dockety in the Roos' house
    -   Sees the picture of Papa Roo
    -   "It remembers this from Heck.  It---*they*---is in Heck."

## Quotes

"Because there used to be a rusty bridge here," Dockety said slowly.
"We tried to repair it but we did not have parts."
Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think.
"Searching...
Yes.
It fell down.
This remembers."

"My grandmother is barely out of her egg when it happens,"
Smarty Leaf confirmed in a slow whisper.
"It is winter.
There is a terrible storm,
much wind,
much ice.
When the bridge comes crashing down,
people say,
the Makers are angry,
we should leave this place,
but others say no,
this is our home,
we will make our own bridge."

"Because if these clean up this mess and put things back the way they were
then the Makers will come back and everything will be *better*,"
Tasercase hissed.
"No more rust.
No more oh, this regrets, these do not have the part you require."
It waved its mis-matched manipulators for emphasis.

"That is just phase one of that's plan," Dockety said.

Smarty Leaf sighed.
"Why do villains' plans always have phases?
Why can't they just get on with it and do some evil?"

## Notes

-   Use "they" as the only singular pronoun, rather than "he" or "she"
    -   "If they wants to do it..." (singular form of verb)
-   Use "this" for bots, who refer to themselves as "this"

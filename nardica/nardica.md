## Chapter 1

*Iffy had a bad dream again that night.
It was the same one she always had,
and the worst part was that it wasn't really a dream.*

*She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into
the fifth-hand ecosuit that had cost them as much as one of their jelly dredging nets.
"Just in case, love," Third said,
forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of her voice.
She kissed the family's youngest clone on the forehead
and slipped her favorite book into the bulky suit.
"Just in case."*

*The ship's horn blared another warning.
Iffy started to cry.
Her olders had pulled her out of her cot just a few moments before,
and she was only half awake.*

*Third hugged her again before Second pulled her away.
"There isn't time," the older clone snapped
as one of the hired crew ran past them toward the stern.
At the time Iffy thought Second was angry at her for something she'd done.
Years later,
she realized that Second had been angry at the sea for what was about to happen,
and at herself for not being able to stop it.*

*"She's boiling!" Fourth shouted from the crow's nest.
"A hundred meters front off starboard!"*

*Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
This time Second didn't try to stop her when she wrapped her arms around Iffy.
"I love you," she said in Iffy's ear.
"Always and forever."*

*"I love you too," Iffy replied automatically.
The thick insulation in the suit made it difficult to bend her arms,
but she tried to return Third's hug anyway.*

*Second bent over and kissed them both on the tops of their heads.
She smelled like engine oil and the soap she always used when she shaved her head.
That was what Iffy remembered afterward---that,
and the stench of methane rising out of the sea around them.
Hundreds of meters below,
a million tiny bubbles of gas trapped in ancient ice were about to free themselves.*

*The deck pitched sideways as First tried desperately
to steer out of the seething mass of foam forming around them.
"She's going to blow!" Fourth shouted.
The ship's horn blared one last time.
The last thing Iffy heard before Third closed the ecosuit's faceplate was a rushing sound.*

*The ship staggered and dropped two meters.
Iffy screamed as she fell back onto the deck.
Second and Third landed in a tangle beside beside her.
A wash of sea water crashed down on top of them.
Iffy screamed again as it dragged her olders against the metal railing.
They grabbed for it,
but then the ship dropped again
as the gas rising from the ocean floor churned the water into
a froth too thin to hold the boat afload.
The last thing Iffy saw before the water closed over her
was Fourth tumbling through the air,
her arms and legs flapping like broken wings against the perfect blue sky.*

*Her dream stopped then,
just like it always did.
She didn't remember being fished out of the frigid Antarctic water a day later
by a passing jelly dredger.
The ecosuit was a hundred years old,
but its seals held.
It kept her warm while the thumb-sized motors in its arms and legs
steered her clear of the after-bubbles that would have swallowed a lifeboat.*

*The woman she learned to call Aunt Naggie said it was a miracle she survived.
It was even more of a miracle that she was allowed to stay on the dredger that found her.
The man she learned to call Uncle Jack didn't like children.
Or animals.
Or foreigners or the governor
or the co-operatives that bought the jellyfish he and Aunt Naggie caught
or the people who sold him supplies
or passers-by who looked at him the wrong way
or didn't have the decency to look at him at all.
He would have dropped her on the dock and sailed away.
The docksiders in Rothera never understood why he didn't,
and wouldn't have believe that
his long-suffering wife had put her hands on her hips
and told him that the child was staying or she was leaving,
which was it going to be?*

*So Iffy stayed, but not the ecosuit.
Uncle Jack sold it almost as soon as they got back to Rothera.
"You're going to outgrow it anyway,"
he growled impatiently over her tearful protests.
"Gotta pay for your keep somehow."*

*He would have sold the book tucked into the suit as well
if Aunt Naggie hadn't misplaced it until he forgot about it.
It had belonged to Third when she was Iffy's age,
and to Second before that,
and came from a time when people still made books you could hold in your hands
and there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
Iffy read a few pages every night no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory on her tablet when she was bored by school,
and on those rare occasions when another child came on board to play with her,
she took out the book and told them all about _orcinus orca_ and _panthera tigris_
and her favorite, _giraffa camelopardalis_.*

*"They were too real!" she said fiercely whenever anyone expressed even a hint of doubt.
"Real as gulls and jellies!"
Real as the handwritten comments in the book's margins
that she spent hours deciphering and daydreaming about.
Real as being hungry and lonely,
she sometimes added to herself as she grew older
and Uncle Jack's business dealings left them a little poorer each season.*

Iffy woke to the sound of Aunt Naggie bustling about in the galley.
She lay on her narrow foam slab for one final precious moment
before slithering out of the salvaged sleeping bag she slept
and pulling a layer of clothes on over her thermals.
That banging was her foster mother's way of telling her that Uncle Jack was awake.
If she knew what was good for her,
she'd be up on deck doing something useful
before he stumbled out into the light looking for someone to yell at.
She tucked her nature book into the slit she had cut in the foam slab to keep it safe,
yawned,
rubbed the stubble on her scalp,
and undogged the door of the storage locker
that had been her cabin for the past eight years.

As she stepped out onto the deck of the *Guinevere*,
the sights and sounds and smells of Halley harbor splashed over her
like the waves in her nightmare.
She stopped for a moment to let her eyes adjust to the light.
To seaward lay the broken hulk of a carrier
that had driven itself aground a century before
to create a seawall for the town's harbor.
Dozens of ships and boats bobbed gently up and down in its lee.
Some were as old as the carrier,
patched and re-patched over the years like the *Guinevere* to stay seaworthy.
Others were newly built,
Aussie-made dredgers piled high with rolls of nets
or streamlined Zillion clippers with bright kite sails furled around triple masts.
Gulls wheeled overhead in their endless search for scraps,
complaining to one another about how cold the Antarctic summer was
and how nobody threw away really good stuff any more,
not like they used to.

The town watched the harbor like a grumpy old man watching children at play.
Back before,
Halley had been a research station where scientists studied the first signs of the big melt.
As the ice shelf disappeared and life back home became desperate
they converted their labs into temporary houses.
By the time their children were grown they had stopped saying "temporary".

Two thousand people now made Halley their home,
dredging jellyfish out of the water during the summer blooms
to render down for fuel and fertilizer.
When winter came they tended the town's precious greenhouses
or sailed north to Tasmania or Patagonia
to find whatever work might get them through the long dark
so that they could start the cycle again.

Iffy shaded her eyes against the razor-edged sun.
A cluster of buildings was taking shape by the newly built pier on the edge of town.
Two were just bunkhouses,
but one was a general store,
and another---the big one that Iffy had watched like a hungry gull all spring---was a machine shop.
Shiploads of precious equipment had already been carted through its double-wide doors:
forges, presses, a lathe with a spindle thicker than Iffy's leg,
and the prize of them all,
an industrial printer from China-over-the-Sea.

It had arrived in the hold of a heavily-armed Aussie destroyer.
The whole town had turned out when the sleek warship came into harbor,
her railguns bristling and her drones darting back and forth above her.
They lined the streets and cheered
as the destroyer's crew and a squad of Marines escorted the boxy machine through Halley's streets
to the quarantine shed by the new pier.
Once the town's core finished its months-long check for malware,
the only limit to what the printer could make would be
the plans and raw materials people could give it.

Iffy had seen some of those plans glowing softly
above the tables of Halley's three caf√©s.
She had taken surreptitious notes on her tablet instead of doing homework
while mechanics and engineers and core techs argued about weights and tolerances and expansion coefficients,
then spent hours looking up words she didn't know and figuring out how they fit together.

She wanted to be part of those conversations so much it ached.
But even more than that,
she wanted to know why visions of things she *hadn't* seen kept popping into her head.
Every time she thought too hard about the plans she had seen,
ghostly shapes appeared behind her eyes,
fractal capacitors
and ever-so-slightly irregular gears
whose off-center spin would automatically synchronize to reduce power loading.
She had gone as deep into the jungle as she dared to find anything that matched,
but every trail ended in "not found" or a blinking, blood-red "restricted".
After a couple of those she had stopped looking,
afraid of who or what might notice.

"Girl! Girl! *Wang ba*, wife, where's that affin' girl?"
Iffy jumped as Uncle Jack's bellowed from below deck.
He had been out with his biffs the night before,
which was Uncle Jack-speak for drinking more than he could handle
and gambling more than they could afford.
Aunt Naggie somehow managed to winkle enough out of his phone while he was snoring to keep the *Guinevere* afloat,
but it had been weeks since they'd had fresh fruit,
and she couldn't remember the last time there had even been mention of new clothes
or of replacing their frayed dredging nets.

"Girl!" Uncle Jack shouted again.
"Get your affin' tail down here *now* or saints help me you'll be scrapin' barnacles for a *week*!"
She heard a meaty *thud!* as he slapped the bulkhead with his hand for emphasis.

With one last longing look at the distant machine shop,
Iffy lifted the hatch beside her and scrambled down the ladder.
"I'm right here, Uncle Jack," she said breathlessly. "I was just---"

"You were just lying about like some fairytale princess, and don't try tell me otherways!"
The *Guinevere*'s captain glared up at her,
squinting as the bright sky framing her head assaulted his hungover eyes.
There was a bruise on his forehead that hadn't been there at dinner, Iffy noticed.
That might mean a visit from the Marines later.
He'd scowl and mutter and make excuses to them,
then bluster to Aunt Naggie after they were gone
about how the governor was just a meat puppet
and how the town's cores were going to sell them all out to the Zillions
as soon as they could get a decent price.

"Your eggs'll be ready in a mo," Aunt Naggie cut in hurriedly
as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to unleash another bellow.
"Do you want a bit of curry on them?
I think I have---no, wait, not there..."
She rummaged nervously among the precious little glass jars
that sat on the shelf beside the galley's little two-loop stove.

"Affin' right I want a bit of curry," Uncle Jack grumbled,
settling into a fold-up chair that squeaked under his weight.

Iffy's stomach grumbled as the smell of eggs, turmeric, and cumin teased her nostrils.
With a tilt of her frying pan and a single practiced flip of her spatula,
Aunt Naggie slid two perfectly fried eggs into Uncle Jack's bowl.
Without so much as a grunt of acknowledgment,
he took the entire basket of naan from the center of table in one hand
and his plate with the other
and disappeared back into his cabin.
As the door closed,
Iffy heard glass clink and something gurgle out of a bottle.

Aunt Naggie let out the breath she'd been holding
and smiled at her foster daughter.
"You'll be hungry then?"

"Not really," Iffy lied.

"Course not. Here."
She pulled a hard-boiled egg out of the pocket of her apron and slipped it to Iffy.
"And here, this too."
A piece of perfectly-browned naan,
still warm and slightly sticky with oil,
appeared out of another pocket.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
"You eaten already?"

"Course, first thing," Aunt Naggie lied in turn.
She tousled Iffy's hair.
"You'd best get that in you quickly and start work on that winch cable he's after having tightened.
And he says the engine's got a knock in it again---best have a look at that too before it starts to bother him." 

"It's the reciprocating rod," Iffy said around a mouthful of fluffy naan.
"Mr. Mishra will straighten it out if I take it in before he gets busy.
It won't cost anything,"
she added hastily before her foster mother could object.
"Not if I do a couple of odd jobs for him."

Aunt Naggie nodded.
"If you say so.
Can you stop in at Sandhu's and see what they want for eggs?"
she added as Iffy turned back toward the ladder.
"Those were our last ones.
I'll tell Jack you're off doing chores once he's..."
She finished her sentence with an apologetic shrug.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
She climbed the ladder and hurried aft as quietly as she could,
praying that the sound of her boots on the deck wouldn't draw attention.

The ship's toolbox rattled as she dragged it out from under the bench at the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Its cast-offs and hand-me-downs included only those tools so essential that even Uncle Jack couldn't afford to sell them.
After a furtive glance over her shoulder,
she reached up under the bench and unclipped the canvas bag that held *her* tools,
the ones she had salvaged and mended or been given in return for doing odd jobs for people around the harbor.
She pushed the toolbox back into place and tucked her toolbag under her coat.

It only took her a few moments to disengage the bent rod from the engine and tuck it into a pocket.
She closed the engine casing as gently as she could and hurried down the gangplank,
the weight of life on the *Guinevere* lifting from her shoulders
as soon as her boots hit the pier.

The Antarctic summer didn't have days or nights,
but ships and people kept to clock time as best they could.
A pair of old women were awake early
to scrape gene-tweaked barnacles off long strips of plastic they had hung off the piers months before.
Hundreds of little shells glittered with tiny particles of metal they had filtered out of the water.
Ground down and incinerated,
they would yield a few grams of copper or manganese
that could keep some old piece of tech limping along for another season.

One of the women straightened and raised a hand in greeting as Iffy went by.
"Beautiful day," she said. "You heading into town?"

"Sure am," Iffy nodded,
not wanting to slow down for a conversation.

The old woman nodded back.
"You mind you be careful, aye?
The *Taroona* came in yesterday,
and them pirates been bustin' up ever since."

"Thanks," Iffy said dutifully.
The old woman smiled and bent back to her strips and buckets.

The teens at the head of the pier arguing over how best to hang up a net for mending
glanced at her as she went by but didn't say anything.
Iffy didn't expect them to.
*At least they don't cross their fingers and spit,* she thought,
remembering the first time she tried to make friends in town.
Sailors were superstitious, and she was a sole survivor.
Nobody looked at her sidelong and whispered
like they had when the loss of her family's ship was still fresh,
but she had learned the hard way that
friends were something that mostly happened to other people.

*Mishra & Co Fine Technical Work - No Job Too Small!* occupied a long shed
that only looked like it was the oldest building in Halley.
The sliding door that took up half its front wall opened once a year if that,
so she banged on the smaller door cut into it.

It scraped open on her third knock.
"Hey Jeep,"
she said brightly to the teenager scowling at her from inside.
"Is your dad here?"
She held up the bent reciprocating rod by way of explanation.

"'s the back," Jeep muttered,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder and making just enough room for Iffy to squeeze past him.

The inside of the shed was a humid mug of long-ago fish,
freshly singed metal,
and the not-entirely-legal coal dust Mr. Mishra burned in the furnace
to keep his equipment from freezing in the winter.
Mismatched light squares hung from the ceiling on hair-thin fibers.
The shadows they cast made the compact machines
and shelves of carefully sorted scrap on the shop floor
look like battlebots from old war sims.
Iffy's heart had been in her throat the first time she ventured among them,
but all she saw now was what they could make---what *she* could make.

Mr. Mishra was sharpening his fingers on a grinding wheel in the center of the shop.
He nodded at Iffy but didn't speak until the last sparks had flown off his steel nails
and the wheel had come to a halt.
Pulling his safety goggles up onto his forehead,
he tugged the calloused fingers of his real hand through the tangles in his beard.
"Buy, sell, or trade?" he asked.

"Trade," Iffy said.
She held up the bent reciprocating rod.
"Tangled some flotsam coming in last night.
The engine over-spun before I could get to it.
There's no cracks or nothin'," she added hastily,
handing the piece to him.
"Just needs to be re-angled and annealed."

"Hm."
The wiry machinist turned the rod over in his hands,
sighted along its length,
then held it up to his good ear and tapped it with his metal fingers.
Iffy had seen him go through this ritual more times than she could count,
and still didn't know if the quiet metal *tick* was just a bluff
or if he really could hear flaws too small for eyes to see.

He handed the rod back to her.
"She'll be right enough once she's straightened," he pronounced.
"But it's going to cost you."

The tension eased out of Iffy's shoulders.
Mr. Mishra didn't bargain unless he'd already decided that he was going to say yes.
After that it was just a matter of price. 

In the end,
getting the rod bent straight cost her half an hour of sorting scraps for smelting.
It wasn't the machine work she'd hoped for,
but she had learned that if she timed her questions right
he would take a minute here and there to show her
how to dog the belaying plate on the laser drill
or how to line up the gatling hammers to rat-a-tat-tat a piece of sheet metal into a graceful springy curve.
She was careful never to stare at the burn scar where his left ear should have been
or at the fractal spider's web of articulated metal that had replaced his left forearm.
She was equally careful not to look up when his son Jeep slouched in
to say that lunch was ready but *amma* said he had to clean up first.

"You hungry?" Mr. Mishra asked
as he spun the handwheel on the drill to lift the laser into its locking position.

"No thanks---I brought," Iffy said,
holding up the egg Aunt Naggie had given her.

"Hm." Mr. Mishra ran his fingers through his beard again.
"Not much to grow on."

"It'll do me fine."
Iffy nodded toward the laser drill as casually as she could.
"You mind I try a couple of pieces while you're out?"

Mr. Mishra shook his head.
"Nuh uh, girl.
Nobody touches my darling without I'm here to watch.
You break that,
I'll have to send up to Amundsen for parts,
and odds are they'll have to send all the way up to Taz."

"Aright," Iffy said, feigning disappointment.
"How about I use the mechanical one instead?
Just for learning," she added hastily.
"It's not paid work or nothin'.
I'll just drill some scrap---you can count it all in and out to make sure."

Mr. Mishra chuckled.
"No worry about the scrap, girl.
And no worry about gettin' paid.
If you've found work hereabouts that I haven't heard of, more power to you."
He rolled his head to loosen the kinks in his neck
and waggled the digits of his artificial hand.
"Mind your eyes and fingers, aye?"

"Aye," Iffy agreed eagerly.
She had her scavenged safety goggles on her face and the drill bit engaged
before Mr. Mishra reached the door.

Drilling holes wasn't hard---she'd learned how to do that long ago.
The hard part was drilling them in the right place.
After examining and discarding half a dozen pieces of scrap,
she found one that was bent enough to be a challenge.

The first hole only took a minute.
It then took her another fifteen minutes to measure,
mark,
measure again,
swear under her breath,
find a pair of calipers in the chaos on top of Mr. Mishra's toolbench,
chock the piece,
measure the hole a second time,
and re-align everything juuuuust a little.
A bot could have done the whole job in a millisecond,
but bots could be hacked or infected with malware left over from the war.
"You want it done fast, you use a bot," Mr. Mishra always said.
"You want it done *right*, you use me."

Slowly, steadily, Iffy brought the spinning drillbit down
until it just barely kissed the metal and--- "What are you still doing here?"
She jumped and spun around.
Jeep was leaning against a set of shelves,
arms crossed and scowl firmly in place.

"I'm practicing," she said defensively.
"Aren't you supposed to be having lunch or something?"

His scowl deepened.
"Finished. Does my *da* know you're here?"

"'Course he does."
Iffy scratched a sudden itch on her nose,
then pulled her hand back down to her side.
Mr. Mishra *did* know, and she had nothing to be embarrassed about.

"Uh huh. What about your uncle?" Jeep straightened up.
"Bet he doesn't know you're wastin' your time."

"I ain't wastin' anythin'!" Iffy said hotly.
"And it's none of your business what my uncle knows and doesn't."
She turned back to the drill,
placing her foot firmly on the pedal that controlled the motor's speed.

But Jeep wasn't done.
He didn't quite bump into her shoulder as he crossed the crowded space to the toolbench.
"Better all be here," he said darkly.
"Anything turns up missing---"

"Anything turns up missing,
your *da* will know for sure it wasn't you as took it,
because you wouldn't have the first clue what would be worth taking!" Iffy snapped.
She cranked the drill bit up into its locked position and switched the machine off.
"Here!" Three quick twists undid the chocks that held her test piece in place.
She tossed it at him harder than the distance required,
then took the calipers from the work tray on the side of the drill
and slapped them back onto the bench.
"Gimme a sec and I'll sweep up the shavings for you to weight,
just so you can be sure you got everything."

Without waiting for answer she pulled the goggles down around her neck
and grabbed the old broom that stood next to a broken sonic press like a forgotten sentry.
Jeep watched her sweep,
resentment and something that might have been embarrassment written on his face.
"You missed a bit," he finally said,
pointing at a random patch of floor before turning and stalking away.
The door banged behind him.

Iffy emptied the dustpan into the trash and tossed her goggles into her toolbag.
It wasn't fair---Jeep could use the equipment any time he wanted,
but all he ever did was complain and look for ways not to.
"What's the point?" he'd shrugged the one time she had asked him why.
"That new tech they're goin' to bring in will do all this ten times faster'n human."

"Goin' to doesn't help us now," she'd retorted.
He scowled at that like he scowled at everything before disappearing into his room
to lose himself in yet another game.

The worst thing was, she knew it wasn't Jeep's fault that he was this way.
Like every other resident of Halley
he had been inducted into the Marines when he turned sixteen.
He'd only served a few weeks---just long enough to be sure that the induction had worked---but
it had changed him.
Iffy missed the bashful sixteen-year-old who had loved to tell bad jokes and help his mother make curry.
"He'll come back eventually," Mr. Mishra said the one time Iffy broached the subject,
his tone making it clear that she shouldn't bring it up again.
"It just takes some folk longer than others to find their way home."

The sky was the same relentless blue it had been an hour earlier when Iffy stepped outside
with the straightened reciprocating rod safely stowed inside her coat.
She peeled her egg as she hurried up the street toward the grocery store,
trying not to get machine grease on it as she devoured the rubbery white flesh and the warm yellow-brown yolk.
A couple of Aunt Naggie's friends smiled or waved as she went by.
She nodded back,
ignoring the others who shook their heads at the sight of a scruffy little jelly dredger
in a stained coat and boots two sizes too big for her.

A commotion down a side street caught her ear.
Someone was singing off-key.
Another voice joined in, then a third, and then glass broke on stone.
"Bloody pirates," a passer-by muttered to his companion.
"Governor shoulda sunk the *Taroona*, not let her berth."

The second man elbowed him,
glancing upward at a sentry drone buzzing overhead.
"I'm sure the governor knows what's best," he said loudly.
Iffy kept her eyes on the cobblestones in front her and hurried on her way.

Sandhu's grocery store was out of eggs.
They had onions,
though,
and a whole case of dried green peppers that had come in from somewhere carefully left unspecified.
Little Mrs. Sandhu wrapped half a dozen in wax paper.
"For your beautiful aunt," she said over Iffy's protests,
just as she did every time she gave her something extra for Aunt Naggie.
"And here, take this too.
A little of our special curry mix.
You know how much she likes it."
She handed Iffy a small plastic jar of orange-brown powder.

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted just as *she* always did.
"You should take your little presents yourself," she scolded.

Her wife smiled.
"*La,* but where would be the romance in that?"

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted again.
"You just don't want your friends in the harbor to know about each another."

Whatever Little Mrs. Sandhu might have said next
was cut short by a jingle from the bell on the store's front door.
Three heads turned at a cheerful, "Good morning!"
as the squarest man Iffy had ever seen walked in.

"Square" really was the only word for him.
He wasn't much taller than Iffy,
but three of her could have stood side by side in the span of his shoulders.
Strong white teeth gleamed against ink-black skin when he smiled,
and the small silvery rectangles of tech embroidered in his temples
made him look like he had stepped out of one of the action games that Jeep played,

"Good morning, *sri*," Big Mrs. Sandhu said, bowing her head slightly.
"Is there something we could help you with?"

"Just some advice, ma'am, if you've any of that for sale?"
His twanging accent sounded 'Merican to Iffy,
though the only 'Mericans she had ever heard had been preaching in the market
or villains in games.

"Advice is always free here," Little Mrs. Sandhu simpered,
wiping her hands on her apron.
Big Mrs. Sandhu looked sidelong at Iffy and rolled her eyes.
Iffy bit back a laugh---Little Mrs. Sandhu's flirting was as famous in Halley
as her smuggled vegetables and hard bargaining.

"Excellent," the square man said.
"I'm just in from South Georgia,
and I'm in need of a place to stay for a few days.
I don't suppose you could recommend somewhere that isn't too expensive?"
He spread his hands apologetically.
"It seems that my luggage went missing in transit."

"Oh you poor *cho*," Little Mrs. Sandhu clucked sympathetically.

Big Mrs. Sandhu shook her head.
"That'd be the *Taroona* you came in on?"
When the newcomer nodded she shook her head again.
"They're *bura badi*,
that crew,
pirates and leggers and worse.
You're lucky if all they nickered was your bags and not your kidneys."

The square man sighed.
"That may be, but I confess that I don't feel particularly lucky.
I was hoping to set myself up in business, but without my tools..."
He shrugged sadly.

"What kind of tools?" Iffy asked.
She had been about to slip away---as entertaining as it would have been to listen to someone try to con the Mrs. Sandhus,
her uncle would almost certainly be awake soon,
and she didn't want to leave Aunt Naggie to deal with his ire on her own.
But tools---that was worth a few extra seconds.

The square man grimaced.
"A couple of half-mil waldoes,
a sintering laser,
a set of diffraction lenses,
a fractal de-ionizer for cleaning the scruff off old cores,
and---"

"There's no such thing as a fractal de-ionizer,"
Iffy cut in scornfully.

The square man blinked.
"Sure there is.
You take the polarizer out of a micromagnetic resonator,
stick it in a high-conductance fractal mesh,
and boom---there's your de-ionizer."

Iffy frowned.
"But wouldn't the resonance feedback slag it?"

"If you're careless, sure," the square man agreed.
"You have to recalibrate the impedance every once in a while so that it doesn't overheat.
But if you have a micropore evaporator---"

"---you can make liquid nitrogen to quench the excess thermal,"
Iffy finished,
the solution suddenly clear in her head.

"Exactly."
The newcomer cocked his head,
looking at Iffy as if she was some strange machine he had to repair.

"Well, if you two are done comparing notes,
there's a couple of places I can point you to,"
Big Mrs. Sandhu cut in briskly.
"Can't promise they'll be as cheap as you want,
but they're clean,
and you won't wake up in the middle of the night with any of your parts gone."

"Thank you," the square man said absently, still studying Iffy.
"And if you don't mind me asking another question,
where did your daughter learn so much about tech?
There are people with a lot of years on them
that wouldn't have thought to worry about the resonance feedback."

"Oh, Iffy's not our daughter,"
Little Mrs. Sandhu said lightly.
"She's crew off one of the jelly dredgers."

"Ah."
The square man nodded as if that explained everything
and stuck out his hand.
"Johnson Wales," he said.
"Pleased to meet you."

Iffy hesitated,
then took his hand and shook it.
"Fifth of Ang Kwan, but everyone calls me Iffy.
Pleased to meet you too."

## Chapter 2

Iffy ran all the way back to the docks,
dodging around and through the people and bots going about their chores
in Halley's narrow streets.
"*Gardez-vous!* *Gardez-vous!*"
scolded the ancient fixit bot that everyone called French Henry
as she squeezed between its rusty frame
and the rack of fuel moss it was tending.

The barnacle farmers were still bent over their work when she reached the pier.
She stopped and put her hands on her knees to catch her breath.
"How's yer haul?" she panted.

"Not bad," one of the pair said.
She nudged a bucket full of barnacles with her boot.
"Prob'ly get thirty grams outta this when it's rendered down.
That'll buy a nice dinner."
Her smile showed more gaps than teeth.

"Good luck," Iffy said.
She straightened up and walked quickly the rest of the way to the *Guinevere*,
her lips moving as she practiced what she was going to say.

Metal clanged on metal as she reached the ship.
"Affin'... shaddin'... dammit!" Uncle Jack swore,
a wrench in one hand and a screw cuff in the other.
Iffy's heart sank.
He was trying to fix the backstay cable she had mended a few days ago.
It was a fiddly job at the best of times,
and if he had a hangover...

The scowl on his face turned stormy as he caught sight of her.
"Where'n the hole you been, girl?" he demanded,
waving the wrench at her.
"There's work as needs done!
And don't give me any o' your excuses!"
he continued as Iffy opened her mouth.
"You get this mended and earn your keep or saints help me!"

"But---"

"Now!"
Heads turned on nearby ships as Uncle Jack's bellow echoed across the water.

Ears burning,
Iffy climbed the gangplank onto the deck.
Her heart sank a second time when she saw the mess waiting for her.
Her uncle had undone the screw cuff holding the frayed backstay cable together
and trimmed the two ends flat.
He hadn't left enough to weave back together,
not without shortening the cable by half a meter,
so she would have to swap the whole cable for one of the forestays,
which meant an hour at least of unwinding and hauling.

Her uncle crossed his arms,
tapping his wrench against the stained thermal vest
that he had worn for as long as Iffy could remember.
"So where've you been while the rest of us have been workin', eh?"

"Groceries," Iffy said sullenly.
She pulled the mended reciprocating rod out of her jacket and held it up.
"Got this fixed too."

Uncle Jack plucked it roughly from her hand.
"Don't see no groceries," he grumbled accusingly,
squinting at the rod.

"I just asked her to pick up a couple o' things,"
Aunt Naggie said,
sticking her head up through an open hatch
like a turtle cautiously checking that the world outside its shell was safe.
"Did they have eggs?"

"Nope, but I got some peppers."
Iffy fished the items she had bought out of her jacket's deep pockets.
"Oh, and Little Mrs. Sandhu said to give you this."
She held up the little jar of curry.

"Oh, that's kind of her," Aunt Naggie clucked
as she tucked everything into her apron.
"Did you get anything more to eat?
I was going to make noodles."

"It's kappa, I'm not hungry," Iffy lied.
"But auntie,
there was a man at Sandhu's,
a mechanic come down to work in the machine shop,
'cept he was on the *Taroona* and they stole his gear.
He was asking after a place to stay,
and we got to talking,
and he said that if he could get his tools back and find work and all,
he might be looking for an apprentice."

"An apprentice?" Aunt Naggie echoed.
"Well, good for Jeep.
It's about time he got out and did somethin'."

"Not Jeep!" Iffy exclaimed.
"Me! I could be his 'prentice!"
The two Mrs. Sandhus had listened with bemusement
as her conversation with Mr. Wales---"call me Johnson, please"---leaped from de-ionizers
to different ways to micro-weld the cracked cases of old cores
to the mended reciprocating rod Iffy took out of her coat to show him.
It wasn't until Big Mrs. Sandhu had cleared her throat
and pointedly suggested that the conversation continue
where they *wouldn't* be blocking her aisles
that Iffy had realized how much time had gone by.

Uncle Jack's hand came down heavily on her shoulder.
"You're not gonna be anyone's anything," he growled,
shaking her for emphasis.
"Not 'til you've paid off every last rand you owe us
for lookin' after you all this time."

Something snapped inside Iffy.
"All right," she said coldly,
knocking his arm away.
"How 'bout you an' me go ask the *Guinevere* to pull up the accounts
so I can see just how much that is,
and I'll tell you how much you owe me
for keeping this twist of scrap afloat when you're too wrung out to do it yourself,
an' then we'll see who owes who what!"

"What we'll see is how well you swim!"
Uncle Jack roared,
raising the heavy wrench he was holding like a club.

"No!"
Aunt Naggie yanked Iffy back and stepped in front of her irate husband.
"Jack, don't!
She's just talking.
She's not going anywhere."

Uncle Jack shook the wrench at them.
"I best see more out of both of you than just talking," he snarled.
"Now get me some affin' lunch, woman.
And you!"
He jabbed a finger at Iffy.
"Fix that shaddin' cable.
I want us ready to sail tomorrow."

"She'll do it right away, I promise," Aunt Naggie said.
Her arm tightened around Iffy's shoulders,
a silent warning not to say anything.

Uncle Jack stalked off,
muttering under his breath.
"You come below and help me with the noodles,"
Aunt Naggie said,
shooing Iffy toward the open hatch.
"That'll give him time to calm down."

"Yes auntie," Iffy said,
her voice only slightly shaky.
Uncle Jack had never actually hit her---as simple-minded as the *Guinevere*'s core was,
it would still instantly report that to the Marines
who doubled as Halley's police.
But with each passing season,
as the *Guinevere* slowly fell apart beneath them despite Iffy's hard work,
his one-sided discussions of big deals and "if only"
had turned into angry tirades and sullen silences.
Iffy didn't know where she would go,
and she couldn't bear the thought of leaving Aunt Naggie to face him alone,
but she knew that one day soon she was going to walk down the gangplank
and never come back.

One day, but not today.

The *Guinevere*'s galley wasn't big enough for two people to do anything side by side
except get in each other's way,
so Iffy sat at its little fold-down table
and watched Aunt Naggie work with the efficiency of long practice.
Within minutes,
two thinly-sliced onions sizzled in a battered ceramic frying pan
while a pot of desalinated water came to the boil.
A handful of diced mushrooms and a splash of soy sauce joined the onions,
filling the air with a rich aroma that tightened the knot in Iffy's stomach.

The knot turned into an ache as Aunt Naggie added a few pinches of spice.
"Is that Mrs. Sandhu's mix?" Iffy asked,
turning a pair of chopsticks over and over in her hands.

"Mm hm," Aunt Naggie replied,
tucking the little jar at the back of her spice shelf.
"Special flavor for special occasions."
She dropped a thick handful of noodles into the pot,
glanced at her foster daughter,
and added a few more.

Iffy put the chopstick back on the table.
"What's so special about today?" she grumbled.

Aunt Naggie glanced over her shoulder at Iffy again and smiled.
"Any time I cook for just the two of us is special," she said fondly.
She knocked bits of onion off her spatula into the frying pan.
"But best we don't mention that to Uncle Jack, all right?"

"Sure," Iffy said,
feeling a knot in her chest to match the one in her stomach.
She stood up and hugged Aunt Naggie from behind.
"You know I won't leave you, don't you?"

Her aunt's shoulders slumped slightly.
She moved the frying pan off the induction loop
and turned around to wrap her arms around the skinny young woman
who had somehow replaced the skinny little girl
she had once read bedtime stories to.
"I love you too, *cho*," she said,
kissing Iffy's shaved head.
"But when your chance comes, you take it, aright?"
She squeezed Iffy.
"Now, gi's a hand with the pot."

A few minutes later Iffy sat down on deck
with her back against the wheelhouse door
and a steaming bowl of noodles in her lap.
She bowed her head and said a brief prayer for the olders she could barely remember,
then began scooping noodles into her mouth.
Not even the sound of her uncle grumbling belowdecks
could spoil the spicy sweet taste in her mouth
or the feeling of the knot in her belly slowly relaxing.

When the noodles were gone
she wiped the last drops of sauce out of the bowl with her thumb
and licked it.
The faint tang of machinery and oil from her unwashed hand barely registered.
She sighed.
She would like nothing better than to close her eyes for a moment,
or better yet a couple of hours,
but the backstay cable *did* need mending,
and it wasn't as if the engine was going to put itself back together---not
on a ship as simple as the *Guinevere*.

She patted her coat
to check that the reciprocating rod was still in her pocket
and hauled herself to her feet.
Down at the base of the pier,
one of the barnacle farmers was balancing a pole across her shoulders
with a large bucket dangling on each end.
The other had stacked the smaller buckets on a two-wheeled cart
and was gently lowering the last of their precious sheets of plastic
back into the sea.
They would haul in on the next pier tomorrow,
then the next and the next
until their circuit brought them back to where they had started.
They had been doing it since before Iffy was born.
It kept them fed,
but little more,
and Iffy would be damned and drowned before she would let anything like that become her life.

Without warning a sketch materialized somewhere between her eyes and her brain.
Two toothed wheels to reel in the strips of plastic,
a sharp-edged scraper to pry the barnacles off,
a lens connected to a tiny core set just so in a wire frame
to steer the scraper so that it didn't dig into the plastic...
The whole thing would only cost a couple of rand to make,
and would save the old women an hour or two every day.
Mr. Mishra had everything except the frame,
and she could literally see how to print that.
She could actually make it,
she realized with mounting excitement.
She could make it and sell it to the barnacle farmers and---

*BOOM!*
The explosion sounded like someone slamming the world's biggest box down on the world's biggest table.
A roiling mass of smoke billowed up into the sky on the edge of town.
"Oh no!" Iffy gasped.
That was where the new machine shop was!

A siren wailed.
Others joined it.
She heard Uncle Jack bellow,
"What'n the hole you done now, girl?"
but she was already racing down the gangplank.

By the time she reached the machine shop
a small crowd had gathered on the paved turnaround in front of it.
The sick knot in her stomach tightened
when she saw that the explosion hadn't been in the building itself,
but in the squat blockhouse beside it
where the industrial printer was sitting in quarantine.
One corner of the blockhouse had collapsed
into a tangle of masonry chunks and twisted foam steel beams.

A rough-looking woman in a green and yellow vest
stood in front of the blockhouse's single door
arguing loudly with two men in dark blue Marine uniforms.
"And *I* said I'll open it when my captain tells me to!"
she said hotly,
uncrossing muscular arms thick with tattoos
and the silver tracery of tech.

Two more Marines pushed through the crowd,
sidekick drones whining faintly over their heads.
One of them pointed at the sergeant's stripes on his sleeve.
"Are you able to see these, citizen?" he demanded.
"These indicate that I have been allocated sufficient authority to direct action
as I think most consistent with regulations regarding general public safety.
We will therefore proceed to inspect this site regardless of your wishes."

The woman's lip curled.
"Consistent with regulations, is it?" she mimicked.
"Well that means nothin' to me, mate,
so you an' your brainwashed friends can---oy!"
She stepped sideways to block a second Marine
as he moved toward the door.

"Clear away! Clear away, all o' you!"
The crowded parted hastily at the shouted order.
Half a dozen sailors pushed through the crowd.
All of them wore variations on the woman's yellow-and-green vest
with *Taroona* stencilled on the back.
"Uh oh," someone near Iffy muttered.

The shaven-headed woman leading the new arrivals put her hands on her hips.
"Y'aright, Bags?" she asked,
scowling at the Marine sergeant, the crowd, and everything else in sight for good measure.

""Kappa, cap'n" the first woman span.
"Just 'splainin' t' these blues that there ain't nothin' here needs their 'tention."

"With respect, citizen," the sergeant said,
his inducted accent making his calm words ridiculous and ominous at the same time,
"Anything potential danger to the residents or property of Halley
is a proper subject of our attention.
Particularly anything that might turn our beloved city into another Bharati."

The crowd murmured.
Twenty years before,
someone's home-brew tech had gone up in flames in Bharati.
Dozens had died as fire swept through the small town,
and dozens more from exposure in the days that followed.
Iffy had never asked Mr. Mishra about that night,
but every year,
on the anniversary,
he and Little Mrs. Sandhu and their friends gathered at the end of the longest pier in town
to toss handfuls of precious flowers into the sea.

The *Taroona*'s crew ignored the mutters of "Too right" and "Just let 'em look"
from the crowd.
One sailor hefted a gaff hook.
Another wrapped a length of chain around her hand.
"Well this ain't Bharati,"
the *Taroona*'s captain said to the sergeant.
"Contract says we're on for mindin' everythin' we hauled down from Taz
'til Halley core tells us otherways,
so whatever happened here is on us t' fix."

The sergeant looked at the debris on the ground.
"Do you regard this as 'taking care', citizen?" has asked pointedly.
The crowd murmured again.

The *Taroona*'s captain crossed her arms.
"That ain't our doin'," she said firmly.
"Printer didn't have any feedstock, not yet.
Couldna made a marble, much less a bomb."
She looked up at the drones circling overhead.
"So *I* think this was someone messin' around tryin' t' do us outta bein' paid,"
she said loudly to the city core's eyes and ears.

"I find your diagnosis comforting," the sergeant said.
"But I still insist on inspecting this site directly."
In one choreographed motion,
he and the three Marines beside him
drew their shock sticks from the holsters on their hips.

"Shad," someone said beside her.
"It's gonna be a dock fight."

Iffy gulped.
She had never seen a fight worse than teenagers shoving each other,
but Uncle Jack had been in several over the years.
The last time they were in Rothera
he had come back to the *Guinevere* bruised and bloodied
and uncharacteristically quiet about what had happened.
As the Marines' uniform jackets hardened into armor,
she turned to find somewhere safer to be.

And bumped into Johnson Wales.
"'Scuse me," she muttered before she realized who he was.

"No worries," he said pleasantly.
"I was actually just leaving myself.
Here---could you give me a hand?"
Without waiting for an answer
he handed her a bulky black box with a flip-up handle on its lid
and stooped to pick up its two identical twins.

"What---?" Iffy started to ask.

"Ssh!" Wales cut her off and looked up at the drones circling overhead.
Without warning,
their buzzing stopped and they dropped out of the sky.

"Oy, that weren't us!" the *Taroona*'s captain protested,
but it was too late.
As the Marines' sidekick drones clattered and cracked on the cobblestones,
the sergeant blew his whistle.
His squad's programming kicked in.
Moving as one,
they charged the sailors in front of them.
Iffy heard the sizzling crack of a shock stick.
Someone shouted an obscenity,
and suddenly people were running past her
as the sailors and Marines did what sailors and Marines have been doing
for as long as there have been sailors and Marines.

"Come on," Wales urged Iffy.
She hurried after him,
the toolbox bumping against her leg.

"Oy!" a voice shouted.
"You there! Where th' hole d'you think you're goin'?"
A rangy man in a yellow-and-green vest with a half-star tattooed on his face
shoved a couple of people out of his way and grabbed Iffy by the arm.

And there it was in her head,
like a wireframe of a machine in a homework assignment labelled with angles and velocities.
Before she even realized what she was doing she spun around,
swinging the toolbox in a sharp arc.
Its rising edge hit the *Taroona* crewman beneath his knee with a crack.

"Aargh! Shaddin' hack, ya wheezy---"
The toolbox in Wales' right hand thudded against the side of sailor's head.
He collapsed to the cobblestones in a heap.

"Run!"
Wales urged as two more sailors caught sight of their fallen comrade
and began shoving toward them.

Iffy ran,
or tried to,
but the toolbox was heavy and awkward
and the women chasing her were half again her height
and they could knock people aside instead of going around them
or pushing in between them and what had just happened?
How could she have *seen* what she needed to do?

Just as a voice yelled, "Gotcha!" another shouted "*Gardez-vous!*"
Iffy screamed as a tubby rust-stained snake of a bot reared up in front of her.
The sailor behind her skidded to a halt on the cobblestones
and was knocked sprawling as her partner slammed into her from behind.

"Mad bot! Mad bot!"
the second sailor shouted,
dodging back as French Henry waved a heavy manipulator at her.

"Come on!"
Wales pulled her into the scatter of people.

For a few moments all Iffy could do was try not to stumble and fall.
Just when she couldn't hold onto the toolbox any longer
Wales dragged her into a side alley.
A few dew-drops of sweat glistened on his forehead.
"Are you all right?" he panted.

Iffy dropped the toolbox on the ground and doubled over to catch her breath.
"No, I'm not aright," she wheezed.
"I just about got my chomper clocked in a dock fight!
And what's this?"
She whacked the toolbox with the toe of her boot,
something between a prod and a kick.
"This what the *Taroona* bikkies upped from you?"

Wales nodded.
"Everything that matters."
Tiny lights danced briefly across the silvery rectangle in his left template.
He looked up as an angry drone buzzed overhead.
Another followed it a moment later.
"Come on---the Marines have called for reinforcements.
We should be somewhere else when they arrive."

Wales led her out the other end of the alley
onto a narrow street lined with two-story houses made of laser-cut stones.
Blue-green moss that had escaped from some lab traced their mortared joints.
The only sounds were the gulls,
the faint whine of a heavy drone passing nearby,
and their boots on the cobblestones.

Iffy struggled to keep up with Wales
as he strode confidently toward the center of town.
The sailors and townsfolk she knew ranged from lean to stringy---cold weather
and the sparse Antarctic diet didn't give bodies much chance to put on weight.
Wales' broad shoulders made him look blocky by comparison,
and the toolboxes seemed much smaller in his hands than in hers.

"Hang up a jif," Iffy finally said.
Wales stopped as she set her load down on the ground and caught her breath.
Between the Marines' inducted fighting skills,
their drones,
and their armor,
the *Taroona*'s sailors would have had about as much chance
as a snowball in Aunt Naggie's frying pan.
"Sometimes people fight just so they can tell themselves they did,"
Aunt Naggie had explained after one of Uncle Jack's misadventures.
"Sometimes trying is the only kind of winning you can hope for."

"*Mon ami! Mon ami!*"
She jumped and squawked as French Henry suddenly rattled around the corner,
its dented old cameras swinging from side to side.
The fixit bot ground to a halt a few meters away.
"*√áa va bien!*" it announced proudly.
"*√áa va tres bien!*"

"What's it saying?" Iffy whispered loudly,
unconsciously backing up a step.
Halley tolerated free bots because they needed their labor,
but there were too many stories of machines being driven mad by malware left over from the war
for people to ever truly trust something as big as French Henry.

Wales didn't seem bothered in the least.
"*Merci beaucoup, mon vieux.*"
He reached into a pocket inside his jacket
and withdrew something that looked like a gray metal waffle.
"*Ici. C'est a vous.*"

A hatch on the fixit bot's front panel popped open.
A slender manipulator as long as Iffy's arm
but no bigger around than her little finger unfolded
and plucked the object from in Wales' hand.
It was a heat exchanger,
Iffy realized,
a miniaturzed version of the one that Mr. Mishra had been repairing
the last time the *Guinevere* was in dock.

As soon as the thought took shape in her head,
a full-blown blueprint materialized out of nowhere.
The heat exchanger belonged *there*,
in the housing around the fixit bot's tiny quantum core.
Except it hadn't actually been designed to do maintenance.
It was an infiltrator designed to worm its way through sewers and outflow pipes.
Half its parts had been replaced by mis-matched odds and ends taken from other bots,
or hacked together out of scrap metal where the tech to make the originals had been lost,
but its original design was still there beneath the patchwork.

Her vision disappeared
as French Henry's slender manipulator folded back into its housing.
"*Merci beaucoup,*" it said,
rocking back and forth in what might have been the mechanical equivalent of a grateful bow
before grinding its gears and rolling away toward the docks
saying, "*Gardez-vous! Gardez-vous!*" once more.

"What was *that* all about?"
Iffy demanded as Wales closed the lid on his toolbox and picked it up.

Wales shrugged.
"Just a hard-to-find part for an old friend," he said,
sounding fond and sad at the same time
as the bot disappear around the corner.
"Come on---we should get going."

"Uh huh.
Must be pretty affin' hard to find for it to take a chance on bein' scrapped
for scarin' people like it did back there."
When Wales didn't answer she nudged the toolbox next to her with her boot.
"So was that you? The 'splosion back there?"

Wales blinked.
"Why on earth would you think that was me?"

Iffy rolled her eyes.
"'Cuz they upped your gear and then the blockhouse blew up
an' then the bot that takes care o' the town's pipes
just happens to be friend enough o' yours
an' now you got your stuff back?
I ain't *stupid*," she finished disgustedly.
Why did grownups always think kids were stupid?

"No you're not," Wales agreed thoughtfully.
He nodded at the toolbox next to her feet.
"Are you okay to carry it a bit further?"

"Am I what?"
Iffy crossed her arms in unconscious imitation of the *Taroona*'s captain.

Wales smiled briefly.
"Sorry.
Arra kappa t' carry at down s'far we go 'long?"

Iffy made a face.
"That was *terrible*," she judged witheringly.
"And sure, but only if I get t' see what's in it."

Wales chuckled.
"Fair enough. Come on."
He glanced up as one last drone zipped past overhead.
Lights sparkled briefly in the rectangle set into his temple,
making Iffy wonder how honestly the drones were reporting the scene
to Halley's central core.

They picked up their loads and walked side by side
behind the Sandhu's grocery
to the caf√© where Wales had rented a room.
The owner glanced from Wales to Iffy to the toolboxes
but said nothing more than, "Tea?"

They sat at the caf√©'s single stone-topped table
and sipped the sweet, strong brew he put in front of them.
Wales sighed contentedly,
then set his mug aside and opened the toolbox Iffy had been carrying.
"Whoa," Iffy breathed.

Some of the tools looked as good as new,
though they had to be at least a hundred years old---only
a handful of well-defended factories scattered around the world
still had the cleanrooms and nano-fabricators needed
to create marvels like the fractal iridium mesh that
Wales briefly let her inspect
through a monocle made from a single perfectly-formed diamond.
Other tools were clearly cobbled together
from whatever spare parts Wales had been able to find.
Iffy felt more comfortable with these,
since pretty much everything in Halley was built the same way.

"An' what about them?" she asked eagerly,
pointing at a nested set of asymmetric gears
as Wales carefully repacked everything.

The square man chuckled.
"Let's save those for another time."
He blinked as the lights in the tech on his temple flickered with activity.
"The town says the Marines have resolved the situation by the quarantine shed---the
explosion was apparently a result of faulty maintenance
on an outflow pipe that hadn't been registered in the town plans.
Oh,
and the disturbance involving the crew of an unnamed Australian vessel
has been resolved."

Iffy snorted.
"Faulty maintenance my orphaned arse.
I know that was you."

Wales blinked at her innocently.
"I'm sure I have no idea what you mean."

"Uh huh."
Iffy glanced at the timer tattooed on the back of her wrist.
"Oh crivens," she swore,
scrambling to her feet.
She'd been gone nearly half an hour---Aunt Naggie would be worried sick,
and Uncle Jack would be furious.

"Hold on," Wales said, patting the air.
"Just a minute, I promise."
He gulped another mouthful of tea and sat back in his chair.
"Tell me more about this ship of yours..."

Wales locked his toolboxes in his room before they left
and put a small plastic bear with bright blue eyes on the shelf above them.
"To keep an eye on things,"
he said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
Iffy nodded---spycams in children's toys were an everyday thing,
even for someone who had grown up as poor as she had.
She didn't know what the orange-and-red globe Wales set next to the bear was for,
but she suspected it would do more than just watch if someone broke in.

A pair of bulky gray drones were hovering over the harbor
as Iffy and Wales walked down to the pier.
"Keeping an eye on the *Taroona*," Wales guessed,
shielding his eyes with his hand to study them.
"Those forks on the front are ultrasonic pulse guns.
One blast from them and you'll have a headache for a week.
And the nozzles behind them probably spray strangle foam."

"Why're they just watchin'?" Iffy asked.
"Why don't the Marines just haul everyone in for th' governor to sort out?"

Wales sighed.
"Politics.
Even if they *did* blow up the quarantine building,
the *Taroona* and the rest of the Aussie fleet
are the only thing stopping the Brazilians from walking in here.
Odds are the captain and her crew will be back on the dock by morning," he concluded,
speaking to himself as much as to the frowning tween beside him.
"Which is another reason I need to talk to your uncle."

"You oughta know he don't keep his word 'less it suits him,"
Iffy warned.
"Or 'less he figures you got some serious haul back o' you."

Wales nodded.
"Thanks for the warning."

Ten minutes later Uncle Jack shouted,
"No affin' way!
We're a jelly dredger,
not a damn ferry!
You wanna slide up along Rothera,
haul yourself three piers over an' buy a ticket."

Wales' polite expression didn't waver.
"I understand it's not your usual line of work," he said smoothly
when the *Guinevere*'s bleary-eyed captain paused for breath.
"And if no is your final answer,
I'll respect that and take my business elsewhere.
But!"
He held up a hand to forestall another explosion.
"What if I could do more than just pay for my passage?"

Uncle Jack snorted.
He had been dozing when Iffy and Wales reached the *Guinevere*,
and from his squint and the smell of his breath Iffy guessed that
she'd find at least one empty bottle in the hold
if she bothered to look for it.
"Lemme guess---you can sing.
Or no---you can do magic tricks and turn jellyfish into gold."

"Almost," Wales nodded. "Except it isn't magic, and gold will be all yours."
He tapped the silver tech in his temple.
"This is a satellite uplink.
A *fully functional* satellite uplink,"
he continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth.
"Which means I can spot patches of sea boil with half an hour to spare.
Maybe a full hour, if the sats are in the right positions.
And *that* means---"

Uncle Jack said a word that sent Aunt Naggie's hands flying to her mouth.
"Ain't no such thing," the *Guinevere*'s captain sneered.
"Not since the war---everyone knows that.
The sats are all 'crypted and the keys are long gone."

"They are indeed encrypted," Wales nodded.
"But not all of the keys are gone---not quite."
He closed his eyes.
"Your beacon is GUIN 40782, is that right?"
He nodded to himself without waiting for an answer.
"Your last trip, you were at sea nine days.
You spent most of it over the Berkner Rise."

"You're trashin'," Uncle Jack contemptuously.
"Everyone 'round here dredges the Berk."

"Some with more luck than others," Wales observed coolly.
"Take the *Whitstable*, for example.
The jellyfish they brought back came up in a boil
just twenty kay northeast of you.
If you'd known it was happening,
you could have been the one to haul them in."

Uncle Jack scowled.
The *Whitstable* was tied up on the next pier,
her captain overseeing a refit
paid for by the hold full of jellyfish she had brought back to Halley
the day after the *Guinevere* had returned.
Her crew had been celebrating their good fortune in Halley's shops and bars ever since.

Uncle Jack scratched his cheek through his uncombed beard.
Iffy could practically hear him resenting the other ship's good luck.
"You're shadding," he growled.
"There's no way you could know somethin' like that 'fore it happened."

Wales didn't answer.
Instead,
he closed his eyes again and pointed toward the *Guinevere*'s stern.
"There's a pair of Aussie freighters a hundred and forty kay that way,
core pilots and human crews,
carrying..."
He paused.
"Profile looks like grain,
but they have something heavier for ballast.
Smuggling machinery, most likely."
He pivoted twenty degrees like a weathervane.
"The *Peacock*, the *Reculver*, and the *Watney Breach* are dreding together.
They're not going to find much---the sea bottom there
might as well be concrete."
He pivoted again.
"And there's a Brazilian catamaran out that way,
three hundred kay and bearing northwest."
He smiled slightly.
"She looks like an old lady dressed up for church."

He turned back toward them and opened his eyes.
"I can get all of it,"
he said in a voice that left no room for doubt or disagreement.
"Every image, every signal---everything every satellite sees, encrypted or not.
And I need to get to Rothera.
The only question is, will that be your good fortune or someone else's?
It's up to you."

Uncle Jack hefted his gaff hook.
"Jack," Aunt Naggie began.

"Quiet," he snapped, still scowling.
Greed and mistrustd warred on his face.
"We keep whatever we haul," he finally said.
"An' the moment we tie up,
you're off an' I've never heard of you."

"Fair enough," Wales agreed.
He stuck out his hand.

Iffy held her breath.
Uncle Jack scowled a moment longer,
then grabbed it and gave it a single perfunctory shake.
"I'm guessin' you'll want to be off right away," he said sourly.

Wales nodded.
"Just as soon as I collect my---"
He froze.

"What?" Uncle Jack demanded.
Wales raised a hand for silence, his eyes half-closed.

"Oh no," Uncle Jack blustered,
drawing himself up to his full height.
"You don't shush me on my ship, not 'less you want to---"

"Someone is breaking into my room."
Wales' good humor had vanished.
"Warm up the engines and get ready to cast off.
I'll be back in ten minutes."

"We'll cast off when *I* say!"
Uncle Jack said angrily.

Iffy's heart sank.
Telling Uncle Jack what to do *always* made him do the opposite.

But her uncle's anger had no more effect on Wales
than a windstorm would on a mountain.
"Here."
He pulled a money card out of his jacket and thrust it at Uncle Jack.
"A down payment."

Uncle Jack turned the flat plastic rectangle over in his hands suspiciously.
"What's it worth?"

"Six thousand rand," Wales said.

"Six *thousand*?"
Uncle Jack pressed his thumb on the corner of the money card.
His eyes widened at the blinking figures it displayed,
then narrowed again as he looked Wales up and down.
"You must wanna get outta here pretty badly,"
he mused.

"It's no use to me if I can't spend it,"
Wales said crisply.
"Now, do we still have a deal?"

Uncle Jack pocketed the card and grunted something unintelligible.
"Thank you," Wales said. "I'll be quick."
He turned to go, then stopped himself.
"Just so you know, this is still switched on."
He tapped the tech in his temple.
"So if you try to call the Marines, I'll know."

Uncle Jack spat over the railing.
"Ain't nobody here calls the blues," he growled,
for once telling the truth.

Wales nodded and strode down the gangplank,
lengthening his stride into a jog
that carried him along the pier and into town.
"That one's trouble," Uncle Jack said flatly.
He leaned his elbows on the railing,
cleared his throat,
and spat again into the water below.
There was more gray in his beard than there used to be,
Iffy thought,
and the three-day fuzz on his shaved scalp
had crept further and further away from his forehead.

Uncle Jack noticed her looking at him.
"Get movin'," he barked,
straightening up.
"An' you too, woman," he added to Aunt Naggie.
"I want us away from whatever's chasin' him soon as he's back."
He strode away,
muttering to himself.

Aunt Naggie and Iffy whooshed out their breath at the same time.
"You gonna tell me what's going on?" Aunt Naggie asked.

Iffy shrugged helplessly.
"I dunno, auntie.
'struth I don't.
There was a fight up along by quarantine,
an' French Henry got into it, and..."
*And all of a sudden I know how to tag someone twice my size,*
she almost added but didn't.
Bots weren't the only ones infected with malware during the war,
and talking about her visions with anyone---even Aunt Naggie---would mean admitting
there was something in her head that shouldn't be.

But something in her expression caught Aunt Naggie's eye.
She put her hand on Iffy's forehead.
"Just be still," she shushed,
stern and worried at the same time.
After a moment she took her hand away,
but her expression didn't change.
"There's no fever.
How about you start getting us ready and I'll make us something quick to eat?"

"Tea would be nice," Iffy said gratefully.

It normally took a full day to get the *Guinevere* ready to sail,
but the money in Uncle Jack's pocket seemed to make him believe it could be done in a blink.
He roared at Iffy and Aunt Naggie to move their sorry sterns,
and no,
don't worry about tyin' that down,
they could do that once they were at sea,
just put it somewhere for now and get the shadding engine goin'!

It took Iffy five minutes of careful work to put the reciprocating rod back in place.
Five more minutes and the engine was chugging away,
biofuel gurgling through kinks in the feed pipe
that Iffy hadn't ever been able to get rid of.
She would normally have checked the winch motor
to make sure they could haul in whatever they caught,
but there wasn't time,
so she laced some straps around the fine mesh nets
they used to dredge for jellyfish
so they wouldn't shift in high seas.
Wait---the fuel hose!
It was still connected to the pump on the pier.
If they had set sail without undoing it,
it would have snapped like an overstretched piece of string.
She had seen that happen once.
It had sounded like a gunshot,
and the torn end had ripped open an unlucky sailor's cheek.

She scrambled up the ladder that connected the engine room to the deck.
"Ready here," she called.

Aunt Naggie coiled the last stayline and shoved it into a canvas bag,
then shoved the bag into a bench locker and dogged the seat-lid shut.
"That's all for me too."
She handed Iffy half a sandwich---curried egg---and
waited ten seconds for her foster daughter to wolf it down
before thumping the cabin wall with her fist.
"Good when you are, Jack," she shouted,
confident as she always was when something needed to be done.

The cabin door flew open.
Uncle Jack stepped out onto deck,
glaring at his wife and foster daughter on principle.
"That's what I said," he told the empty air impatiently.
"Six thousand rand.
I'll have it in a week.
What?
Never you mind how, but that'll more'n put us square.
Right.
Aright.
What?
No, you affin' well better *not* tell her,
or she'll take your skin off an' mine too!
Right.
Aright.
*Vi da*."
He blinked twice to end the call and bared his teeth.

"Who was that?" Aunt Naggie asked cautiously.

Uncle Jack's self-satisfied smile vanished.
"Ne'er you mind," he said brusquely.
"Everythin' stowed?"

"Everythin' that's gonna be," Aunt Naggie said.
"But Jack---"

"I said, ne'er mind!"
He slapped the railing with his hand.
"Now, where's our high-rollin' troublemaker?"

Five minutes crawled by,
each one tenser than the last,
until Wales appeared at the end of the pier.
One toolbox hung from each hand.
The third was slung over his shoulder on a strap,
and he had a small travelling pack on his back.

Iffy scurried down the gangplank and ran to him.
"Thank you,"
Wales said gratefully
as she took one of the boxes from his hand.
"I keep telling myself I should rig something up to carry them,
but I never seem to have time."

"No worries," Iffy replied.
Then she gasped.
"You're bleeding!"

"Am I?"
Wales pulled a rag out of his pocket,
dabbed at his nose,
and studied the red blotch a moment.
"So I am. Huh."
He put the rag back in his pocket and began limping toward the *Guinevere*.

"What happened?"
Iffy puffed as she fell into step beside him.
"Was someone really tryin' to break into your room?
Were they from the *Taroona*?
Did you get punched up?
An' what's wrong with your leg?"

"Oh, everything was mostly sorted out by the time I got there,"
Wales said vaguely.
"And my leg's bothered me for years.
I keep meaning to get it looked at,
but I never seem to have time for that either.
There just never seem to be enough time," he repeated.

Uncle Jack didn't wait for Wales to stow his belongings
before hauling in the gangplank and casting off.
The engine rumbled and coughed for a moment
as they pulled away from the pier,
then settled into the steady thumping that was as familiar to Iffy as her own breathing.

They were halfway across the harbor
when a klaxon blared *brrrap! brrrap!*
Iffy ran to the stern in time to see a flock of drones converge
on the pier six over from where the *Guinevere* had been berthed.
They swirled in a circle,
careful to keep their distance from one another.

A single ship lay alongside the pier,
long and low and gray and dangerous---the *Taroona*.
Iffy shaded her eyes with her hand.
The ship looked like it was casting off,
but no,
a pair of Marine boats were blocking her path
and a platoon of figures in blue were trotting toward the pier.
She glanced at Wales,
wondering if this was somehow his doing,
but the 'Merican's eyes were on the horizon.

They rounded the broken-backed carrier that was Halley's seawall a few minutes later.
The swell beneath them instantly grew stronger.
Uncle Jack took the first watch,
grumbling that if they were hauled in by the Marines
everyone should just let him do the talking.
Aunt Naggie said she would take the second watch,
then shooed Iffy off to sleep.
"You can talk to Mr. Johnson in the morning,"
she said firmly.
"Let him have his rest now."
Then she smiled the way she only did
when she and foster daughter were alone together.
"You'll need some too
if you're gonna go chasin' after that special friend o' yours in Rothera."

"Honesty ain't special!" Iffy protested automatically.
Still smiling,
her foster mother pulled her into a hug and kissed the shaven top of her head,
then gently pulled the door of the storage locker closed behind her.

Iffy pulled her nature book out of her mattress
and lay on her stomach to page through it.
The orca, the tiger, the gorilla...
She ran her fingers over the pictures,
sounding out the handwritten comments beside them.
*Mom took us to see the baby giraffes today,* said one.
*There are three of them.
They are all clones and they live in a big dome because of the virus.
Mom says they have been tweaked to be immune to it.*
And then,
in an older version of the same hand,
*Turns out they weren't.
Mom says there isn't money to try again,
so I guess that's it for giraffes.*
And then there was a sad cartoon face,
one of several scattered through the book.

Iffy browsed the other animals,
wondering what it would have been like to live in a world
that had so many different kinds of creatures.
She stubbornly tried to keep her eyelids from closing
until she couldn't remember why they shouldn't.
When she finally dozed, she dreamed.

*She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue,
and her olders were stuffing her into her ecosuit.
"Just in case, love," Second said, forcing a smile.*

*But when the ship's horn blared it wasn't a horn at all
but the sound of a drill press.
She was in Mr. Mishra's,
fumbling clumsily to reassemble a mound of chips and gears and actuators
that she had never seen before.
Her heart raced as she tried to piece them together.
This rod into that socket---no,
that couldn't be right,
it turned the wrong way and didn't leave enough space for the lens,
because the lens had to go there,
it had to,
she didn't know how she knew but she did and time was running out.*

*And then suddenly she could see the whole design
from the overall schematic
down to the bevelled teeth of the microscopic gears
that would catch and grind on specks of dust too small to see or feel
if they weren't assembled just so in airtight diamond cases.
There and there,
that's where the hair-fine optical fibers had to go,
and there,
right in the machine's heart,
was the space where a miniaturized core could---*

*The whole room heeled hard, throwing her to the floor.
"She's going to blow!" Mr. Mishra shouted,
and then all Iffy could hear was a rushing sound
as the ship fell away beneath her into a pit of churning foam.*

She woke up drenched in sweat.
Hugging her pillow to her chest,
she buried her face in her mattress to muffle her sobs.
When they finally ran down she wiped her nose angrily on her sleeve,
rolled over on her back,
and fumbled on the floor beside her for her water bottle
before remembering that she hadn't refilled it.
"Idiot," she muttered,
thumping her fist against her mattress.

It took her a long time to fall asleep again.

## Chapter 3

It was four days to Rothera across the Weddell Sea.
Two hundred years ago their route would have been choked with ice,
even in summer,
but no longer.
Waves a meter high made the *Guinevere* rock from side to side in a surging rhythm
that Iffy knew as well as she knew her own heartbeat.

After motoring through the not-actually-night of the Antarctic summer,
Uncle Jack ordered the *Guinevere* to raise the sails.
The ship's tiny obediently ran her mis-matched gossamer sheets up her twin Y-masts.
By the time Iffy crawled into her clothes,
Halley had fallen below the horizon.

"Best stay outta his way," Aunt Naggie advised
when Iffy clambered down into the galley to get tea.
"He ain't used to havin' folk on board.
I expect he'll settle in."
It sounded more like a prayer than a prediction,
but Iffy nodded and climbed back on deck
with two chipped ceramic mugs in her hand.

"'Bout affin' time," her uncle said sharply
when she knocked on the door of the pilot house
and handed his to him.
He slurped a mouthful and set it in the ring next to the ship's wheel.

Iffy glanced at the control panel.
Tiny cameras dotted about the ship showed the engine,
the hold,
the sails,
and practically everywhere else on the ship except the tiny toilet near the stern.
Small graphs scattered among the images told her at a glance
how much fuel they had,
how much tension was in the forestays and mainstays,
and what the wind and the currents around them were doing.

The most important display was the sonar.
Every captain kept a close eye on that if they wanted to make it home.
At the first sign of gas bubbling up from the ocean floor,
they would fire up the engine and run.

Uncle Jack jerked a thumb at a panel highlighted in orange.
"You get that backstay cable mended soon as you're done here if you want lunch,"
he growled.

"Yessir," Iffy said obediently.
He'd been drinking again, she realized.
She could smell it on his breath,
and from the way he clutched the wheel to hold himself steady
she guessed he'd been at it for a while.

"An' see if that baggage o' yours wants to get started mendin' things,"
he called after her as she turned to go.
"Or better yet, just tell 'im I said he was goin' to!"

Wales had reorganized the ship's other storage locker while Iffy was asleep
to make room for his pack and toolboxes,
then seated himself on a thwart at the *Guinevere*'s stern.
He seemed lost in thought as Iffy approached him,
but said, "Of course," in reply to Iffy's tentative request for help.
Standing,
he straightened his jacket and smiled.
"Being useful would be good for me right now."

"You thinkin' 'bout them off the *Taroona*?
Not that it's any o' my look-in,"
she added hastily.

Wales shook his head.
"No,
I was thinking about the *Landrieu*.
The big ship back at Halley,"
he continued as Iffy gave him a blank look.
"The one the town uses as a breakwater.
She was a marvel in her time.
Fractal carbon ribs,
a foamed poly-composite hull,
and a core smart enough to qualify for citizenship.
She was one of the first ships to sail alone across the Pacific,
but then the war came, and..."
He sighed.
"It must have broken her heart to run herself aground."

"I guess," Iffy said to fill the silence that followed.
"Can't imagine how I'd feel if somethin' like that happened to the *Guinevere*."

Wales shook his head to clear it.
"Let's hope you never have to find out," he said,
suddenly brisk.
"Now, where's this cable we're supposed to splice?"

Iffy had hoped that Wales would bring out his toolboxes---she
was itching to examine their contents in detail---but instead,
he studied the hacked-off ends of the backstay cable
with a hand-held smart lens
that highlighted the worse of the damage with garish reds and yellows.
Iffy wanted to tell him that the damage wasn't her fault,
but she bit back her words.
There was no way she could tell him that without saying that it had been Uncle Jack,
and as much as she wanted him to think well of her as a mechanic,
no self-respecting sailor would ever cast shade on her captain
in front of a passenger.

"All right," Wales said,
slipping the magnifier back into one of his coat's many pockets.
"What's the plan: splice, clamp, strap, or weld?"

"I was thinkin' I could splice it?" Iffy ventured hesitantly.
When Wales nodded
she fished a roll of twisted eight-gauge cable from her bag of odds and ends
and dug around to find a wire cutter and a pair of needle-nosed pliers.

The next half hour flew by as Iffy lost herself in the task at hand.
She had expected Wales to take charge,
but instead he asked one question after another,
drawing ideas out of her that she hadn't know were there.
It was like the schematics that sometimes popped into her head,
but without the gut chill of not knowing where they came from.

Once the first dozen lengths of splice were woven into the cable
Wales sat cross-legged on the deck and held the cable's ends together
so that she could finish connecting them.
Iffy worked as quickly as she could,
waiting for him to say it was time for a break,
but he didn't.
*Uncle Jack wouldn't have been able to hold the cable like
that for more than a minute,* she thought.
Even Mr. Mishra would have struggled,
but Wales seemed unbothered.

Over, through, under, through...
"There," she said, sitting back on her haunches.
"Wanna see if she holds together?"

Wales stood,
trapped one end of the cable under his boot,
and pulled hard.
The splice stretched slightly,
and for a moment Iffy was afraid it would give way,
but it held.
"Looks good to me."

Iffy shrugged, unused to praise.
"Only one way to find out."
She hit the switch on the winch beside her.
The cable zinged as it was wound in,
then made a sharp *crack!* as it came taut.
Iffy picked up a wrench and whacked the splice a couple of times as hard as she could.

Wales blinked. "Are you always this direct when you're working?"

Iffy grinned. "Pretty much."

There were other things to mend after the cable.
There always were on the *Guinevere*:
a spidery network of microscopic cracks on the forward mast,
a loose coupling on a bilge pipe,
or a handle on the main hatch
that had started sticking mid-way through their last voyage.
Like most of the vessels that called Halley home,
the *Guinevere* was more than a hundred years old,
constructed from materials that could no longer be made,
only repaired.
Keeping her afloat was a matter of swaps and trades and patches,
of scouring noticeboards in the jungle
to find tips that weren't self-replicating spamotage left over from the war,
of swapping messages with other mechanics
trying to keep their own ships running,
of running simulations to see if this patched with that
would hold together in sub-zero temperatures.
In the end,
though,
it always came down to the combination of clever hands,
brute force,
and improvisation Iffy had used on the cable,
and she loved it.

Wales worked beside her the whole time,
handing her tools,
holding things steady while she screwed them in
or used her cherished little laser to put a patch on a weld
that held an even older patch in place.
He somehow managed to keep up a steady stream of questions
without ever making her feel like he was pestering her.
She enjoyed every minute of it,
just like she enjoyed the times
when Mr. Mishra turned something she'd made over and over in his hands
and pronounced it well done,
or when Uncle Jack was sound asleep
and Aunt Naggie told her stories about growing up in South Africa
in the years after the war,
when fruit still grew on the trees and people had pets that weren't rats and reptiles.

Wales seemed to enjoy the work as well,
right up until the moment he helped Iffy lift the cover off the backup generator
near the *Guinevere*'s stern.
His face fell at the sight of its compact, soot-stained bulk.
"Y'aright?" Iffy asked,
fanning away the smell.

"I'm fine," Wales said,
gazing down at the filthy ceramic engine block.
"I just thought you ran on jellyfish sludge, not coal dust."

"The main engine's a jelly-burner," Iffy said.
"This here is just for when it's bust,
or for haulin' the winches when there's ice 'n' all."

The square-faced man sighed.
"But---coal? Really?"

Iffy's eyes widened.
"Oh crivens---you ain't an Eco, are you?
Uncle Jack'll put you o'er the side an' no mistake.
He hates Ecos even worse'n he hates Zillions."

Wales sighed again.
"No, I'm not an Ecologist.
Or Brazilian, for that matter.
I just..."
He squatted on his haunches
and looked resignedly at the engine.
"Come on. Let's get this done."

He asked fewer questions after that,
but despite his obvious distaste
he clearly knew how coal engines worked.
Half an hour after they started,
the lasers that ignited the coal dust the engine used for fuel
were sparking away in perfect time
and the cinder clog that had been blocking the intake pipe
had finally been dislodged.
She would normally have let the engine run for a few minutes to test it,
but the thought of Wales not saying anything if she did
made her decide not to.

Aunt Naggie made noodles for dinner.
The smell of synthetic coconut milk,
greenhouse peppers,
diced mushrooms,
and spices made the galley as warm and as comfortable as an old sweater.
"Just for you," Aunt Naggie whispered to Iffy,
spooning a bit of Mrs. Sandhu's special curry into her foster daughter's bowl
when Uncle Jack's back was turned.

Wales thanked Aunt Naggie profusely before taking his up onto deck to eat.
"I like watching the waves," he explained
when she protested that the galley could hold four,
it wouldn't be a problem.

"Foolishness,"
Uncle Jack muttered as soon as Wales was gone,
though whether he meant the idea of four people eating at the galley's little table
or the idea of watching waves for pleasure
he didn't say.
He stabbed a chunk of mushroom with a chopstick and stuffed it into his mouth.
"I don't like 'im.
Bet there's more'n just the *Taroona*'s crew lookin' for 'im.
Hell,
I bet someone would pay double what he's givin' us
to know where he's at."
He stabbed another piece of mushroom.

Iffy ate in silence, head down.
The safest thing to do when Uncle Jack got a money-making idea
was to wait for it to pass---pointing out
the holes in his plan
was the surest way to make him actually do it,
just to prove that no one could tell *him* which way was up.
And while she still knew next to nothing about their passenger,
she had the feeling that crossing him
would be the dumbest idea Uncle Jack had ever had.

She and Aunt Naggie cleaned up afterward.
"He seems nice," Aunt Naggie observed
as she scraped the last traces of sauce off a plate into the composter.
"Handy, too."

"Mm hm," Iffy agreed
around a last mouthful of noodles.
"Might even be able to talk the core into behavin'
if Uncle Jack'll let 'im take a crack at it."

"Oh now, wouldn't that be nice?" Aunt Naggie sighed wistfully.
"No more sittin' up in the middle of the night
wonderin' if the ship's gonna get the notion to head for Argentina or somethin'."

"But then when would you knit?" Iffy asked,
nudging her foster mother with her elbow.
Aunt Naggie blushed.
Her "knitting" consisted of two balls of yarn,
a pair of needles,
and an endless series of romance novels
featuring wealthy strangers with smoldering eyes
who didn't realize how empty their rich, idle lives were
until they met the right person,
who was inevitably a poor but honest sailor.
The books were churned out by a core in Rothera
that had spent the war crafting disinformation for rebel bots.
Their implausibility and steamy dialogue
only added to the thrill Iffy felt
whenever she managed to get an hour alone with Aunt Naggie's tablet.

"Never you mind about my knitting," Aunt Naggie said primly.
"You're on watch tonight,
so you best get a nap an' I'll wake you in a few."
She kissed the top of her foster daughter's head as Iffy groaned.
"Off with you now."

Wales was back on the thwart at the stern when Iffy got topside,
his empty bowl on the deck beside him.
She hesitated,
wanting to talk but not knowing what to say,
then slipped silently into her converted storage locker.
Taken by a sudden restlessness,
she spent five minutes rearranging her meager possessions
before flopping down on her bed and pulling out her nature book.
The giraffe, the tiger, the wolf with his sad, intelligent eyes...
Someone had written *Looks like Grandad!!!* beside it in tiny curving script.
Iffy had long ago decided that the writer had been a girl about her own age
who had a family and more than just one friend.
She closed the book,
tucked it back into her mattress,
and squeezed her eyes shut.

A soft chime in her ear woke her.
She sat up and stretched,
then scraped the sleep from the corners of her eyes.
Her windowless room was completely dark,
but her hands found her clothes on the floor beside her foam slab.
She pulled them on over the onesie she had slept in,
slipped her feet into her boots,
and went out to face another day on the southern ocean.

Aunt Naggie nodded to Iffy when she reached the pilot house.
"Get any sleep?"

Iffy yawned and plopped herself onto the stool beside her foster mother.
"Good enough. How's she doin'?"
She studied the control panel for a moment.
There was a bit too much tension in the mainsail,
and wind drag over the hull was ten percent higher
than the ship's simple-minded core thought it ought to be,
but that was all normal.
She wondered wistfully what it would be like to have tech in her head like Wales
so that she could feel the ship
the way she felt the sun on her face
or the sting of the spray on her skin in a high sea.
She knew it would never happen:
stuff like that had to be implanted at birth
for the brain to learn how to use it.
But she had once paid two carefully-hoarded rand
for five minutes under an induction headset at Halley's midsummer carnival
reliving a glitchy pre-war recording of someone riding a surfboard,
and had fantasized about being the *Guinevere* ever since.

Aunt Naggie nudged her.
"Come about, sleepy head," she chided gently.
Iffy started and straightened.
Her foster mother jerked her chin at the thermos of tea
in the ring holder next to the ship's wheel.
"Fresh made.
Well, fresh-ish," she amended.
"But it oughta keep you through your watch."

"Thanks auntie."
Iffy jerked her chin at the panel
as one of the cameras switched views
to show Wales sitting on the thwart at the stern.
"He been there this whole time?"

"Hasn't budged 'cept to visit the necess'ry," Aunt Naggie confirmed.
"Turned on the sound a while back to ask if he wanted to come and sit,
but he was talkin' to himself, an' I figured..."
She shrugged.
The only other person on board who talked to themself was her husband,
and it was best not to interrupt him when he did.

"Aright, lemme take over."
Iffy reached past Aunt Naggie
to press her thumb against the dark glass square beside the control panel.
After a moment's hesitation it bleeped and blinked green
to confirm that the ship's core understood a different human was now in charge.

Iffy had scrolled through the core's log many times.
It had been almost sixty years years since it had last been wiped clean
(probably,
she suspected,
because the holds had been full of contraband instead of jellyfish at the time).
Six watches a day while at sea,
with only a few weeks a year tied up or idle,
made for almost a hundred and twenty five thousand thumb presses and bleeps.

She had read the highlights of the log
almost as often as she had read her nature book.
Storms, storms, and more storms as the planet warmed up,
some hurling waves taller than the ship's fully-extended mast
to swamp the *Guinevere*'s decks.
Births and deaths and even a shipboard wedding---Aunt Naggie's parents
had invited a dozen friends on board in Rothera to see them exchange vows.
Pirates, twice, and angry notes about dock wardens who wouldn't stay bribed.
"A whale??" followed by "don't be an idiot",
repairs laid over older repairs like layers of barnacles,
and a one-line entry noting that
the sole survivor of a ship lost to a clathrate blow
had been brought on board.

Iffy gave the control panel a protective pat.
"I got you," she whispered.

She watched through the cameras
as Aunt Naggie trudged back to the cabin she shared with her husband of twenty years,
then stared out at the sea.
The endless light of the Antarctic summer
cut sharp reflections into the waves around her.
She toyed with the idea of playing a sim on the ship's core---a
sea monster with tentacles the size of pier posts,
or a war-time training drill
that would send her dodging and weaving through flocks of hostile drones---but
instead she sighed and pulled up some homework.
Her classroom schooling had ended when she turned ten.
Since then her teachers had been tutoring programs
that she and Aunt Naggie had scrounged, bought, or traded for,
each one guarded by security tough enough to keep out generations of teenagers.
If she didn't do at least a little every day,
Aunt Naggie would sigh and look disappointed,
and she'd rather learn anything---even literature---than face that.

That evening, though, the subject was modern history.
Iffy turned the interaction speed to maximum as the story unfolded.
People burned coal, then oil, then coal again...
Forests were cut down or worn to nothing by drought as the winds shifted...
Fish disappeared as pollution took its toll,
replaced by the jellyfish that now choked the seas...
She skipped over the description of how
warming caused the ancient clathrate ice on the ocean floor to thaw,
sending even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
She knew all she needed to
about what giant bubbles could do to ships unlucky enough to be above them.

She played through half a dozen "what if?" sims,
doing worse each time.
Suddenly restless again,
she closed her homework
and tapped one of the video squares on the control panel.
"Hey," she said,
her heart in her throat.
"Don't mean to interrupt, but I got some questions if you got time."

The tiny image of Wales turned its head.
"You're not interrupting at all," he said,
speaking directly to the pin-sized camera and microphone
set into the railing beside him.
"I'm always happy to talk."

A few moments later he knocked on the pilot house door.
"Permission to come aboard?" he asked,
waiting for Iffy to gesture at the stool beside her before seating himself.
He looked around the pilot house appreciatively.
"She's beautiful, isn't she?"

"She's aright," Iffy allowed.
"Hull still mends itself if we give it time,
an' th' core's mostly holdin' together.
Gotta keep an eye on it, though.
We let it sit too long,
it just stops talkin' to us."

Wales nodded.
"Probably over-cooled.
A lot of people did that to cores when the war started,"
he continued in response to Iffy's questioning look.
"Someone started a rumor that the colder the core was,
the less likely it was to go rogue,
so everyone cranked their thermostats down as far as they'd go
and then forgot they'd done it.
Have you tried putting a twist coil inside the housing
to offset the thermal loss?"

And as easily as that they slid into a conversation
that leaped from
the relative merits of fractal carbon versus foamed aluminum for masts
to tricks for keeping a drill press lined up and steady
when the building it was in was shaking.
Iffy was just about to ask when that would ever actually be an issue
when he raised a hand to stop her.

"Hang on."
His eyes closed as he communed with the satellite passing overhead,
then snapped open.

"We need to change course," he said,
surging to his feet.
"We need to change course *now*."

"What's wrong?" Iffy asked,
but Wales was already gone.
His boots thumped on the deck as he ran sternward
to bang on the door of Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie's cabin.

"Captain! Captain, I need to speak with you!"
He waited a second, then pounded on the door again.

"Uh oh," Iffy muttered,
watching on the control panel as the door flew open.

"You better tell me we're sinkin', or I'm puttin' you over the side!
I was *asleep*!"
Uncle Jack bellowed.

"We'll be worse than sinking if we don't change course," Wales said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
"A ship just glitched out of stealth about thirty kay behind us.
She's still throwing up a lot of dazzle,
but she's moving fast,
and she's definitely not here for the jellyfish."

Uncle Jack goggled at him.
"Pirates?" he spluttered.

"Only if we're lucky," Wales said grimly.
"We need to change course *now*, captain.
If we head straight for shore
I can put up a bit of dazzle of my own
and try to keep us away from any drones she sends up."

Uncle Jack swore.
"Naggie! Up and movin', woman! We got trouble!"

Iffy had simmed dozens of chases at sea.
Sometimes she was the captain of a customs cutter
trying to catch a school of smugglebots.
Other times she was in command of a Zillion catamaran
skimming across the water under core-trimmed sails
with a hold full of organic food and subversive software.
Some of the sims ran for hours as she played gull and rat
among the jagged rocks of the Antarctic shore.
She had won more than she had lost,
but that was little comfort now that the game was real.

Wales winced but said nothing as the *Guinevere*'s coal engine sputtered to life.
The ship picked up speed
as her propellors churned the sea behind them into a white froth.
Uncle Jack's hands danced across the control panel,
telling the ship's core to tilt the sails past their redline
to balance the increased thrust at the stern.
The ship swayed more wildly with each passing wave
as she traded stability for speed.

"Eighteen west, heading one sixty five, at twenty-six kay and change,"
Wales called as he ran to the bow to clip a battered black cylinder to the railing.
The ship's control panel wavered and reformed as the gadget powered up
and began spraying misinformation on all frequencies.

"How fast?" Uncle Jack growled.
"Tell me how shaddin' fast, man."

"Twenty kay an hour." Wales hesitated.
"Make that twenty-two.
She's military for sure."

Uncle Jack horked and spat into the garbage pail by his feet.
"Don't mean she ain't a pirate.
Naggie! Where's my shaddin' tea?"

Iffy stepped out of the doorway to let her foster mother squeeze past her
and hand a thermos to her husband.
She put her arm around Iffy,
but the frightened expression on her face
cancelled out whatever reassurance she meant to give.
Jelly fishers didn't have much worth stealing besides their ships,
but those ships were worth a lot---enough
for their captains to make a habit of sailing close by each other
whenever strangers were near.
And while Iffy didn't pay any more attention to politics than her homework required,
she knew that the tension between the Zillions
and the loose coalition of governors and factory cores
that ruled Antarctica on Australia's behalf
had been getting worse.

"Fifth."
Wales fished a plastic chip out of his pocket and handed it to Iffy.
"In my cabin,
the toolbox with the purple square on the end.
Can you get it for me, please?
Be sure to tap this near the handle before you open the cabin door."

The cold spray thrown up by their speed stung her face
as she ran to his cabin
and tapped the plastic shard on the door handle.
She waited for a click or a tone or *something*.
When nothing came she swallowed hard and,
half-expecting disaster,
yanked the door open.

Wales' three toolboxes lay side by side on the floor.
She lifted the one marked by a purple square,
turned around,
and squawked at the sight of Wales' toy bear crouched on all fours in the doorway.
Its blue eyes flickered.
She heaved a shaky breath and stepped aside.
It scurred across the floor and disappeared into
the piles of odds and ends strapped against the locker's walls.

She hurried back to the pilot house,
the toolbox bruising her thigh with every second step.
"How we doin'?" she asked.

Wales shook his head.
"She hasn't changed course.
Either she doesn't know we've spotted her or she doesn't care."

"Or she's jus' waitin' 'til we're in closer to shore,"
Uncle Jack growled.
"Her dazzle's enough t' cover the both of us
if she gets us up against th' rocks."
He swiped two fingers across the control panel
in an angry, futile attempt
to squeeze a little more speed out of the *Guinevere*'s struggling engines.

Wales hefted his toolbox.
"I might be able to do something about that.
Excuse me."
He squeezed past Iffy and Aunt Naggie.

"You go lend 'im a hand,"
Aunt Naggie told Iffy in a low voice.
"I'm goin' to make some more tea an' put some food together.
No sense bein' sunk on an empty stomach."

"Ain't nobody gonna sink us," Uncle Jack snapped
without taking his eyes off the control panel.
Aunt Naggie shooed Iffy out of the pilot house without replying.

Wales was on one knee near the bow beside his open toolbox.
The half-assembled drone in his hands
was the same size as the sentry bot in his room
but skinned with camo
that changed color to match his hands and coat and the deck
every time he turned it over.

Using a pair of diamond-tipped tweezers,
Wales detached a manipulator as thin as a drinking straw
and placed it carefully back in the toolbox.
"Have to cut the weight," he explained to Iffy without looking up.
"We're going to need all the range we can get."

He removed the drone's other tiny arm and stowed it beside its twin,
then handed the compact little machine to Iffy.
"Probably best if you don't tell your uncle about this part," he said quietly
as he used the nail of his left thumb
to peel the false skin back from the pad of his right forefinger.
Underneath lay a small patch of silver
whose lights blinked in time with the larger square set in his temple.

Iffy gasped. "Are you trans?"

Wales glanced at her, a wry smile on his face.
"You know, that used to mean something very different than it does now.
But no, I'm not transhuman.
I just don't like advertising how much tech I have in me.
It's hard enough having people try to cut my head off every once in a while---if
I had to worry about waking up minus a finger or two I'd never get any sleep."

He pressed his silver fingertip against the side of his toolbox.
"Sixteen orange kneecap," he said quietly.

Iffy held her breath,
half-expecting the toolbox to transform itself into---well,
she didn't know what, but *something*.
Instead,
a tiny blue light blinked twice in the handle.

Wales took a deep breath and lifted the toolbox's inside
to reveal a shallow compartment in the bottom.
Nestled among the tech hidden there
were half a dozen small cylinders,
each the size of Iffy's little finger.
Four empty holes showed where others had once been.
Using his tweezers once again,
Wales plucked one of the cylinders from its resting place
and inserted it into the base of the drone.

"Battery?" Iff guessed.

Wales shook his head.
"Its battery is built in.
This is...
This is just in case."
He reassembled the bottom of the toolbox and tossed the drone into the air.

It rose, started to fall, and then---Iffy blinked.
She couldn't see any rotors or hear any buzzing or whining.
The drone just *floated*,
its sides shimmering slightly as if it were a hologram.

"It's covered in ionizing impellers,"
Wales explained before Iffy could ask.
"They were meant for Mars,
but they work in our atmosphere too."

Before Iffy could ask how a drone built to explore Mars
wound up in a toolbox in Antarctica,
Wales pointed his silver-tipped finger toward the horizon.
With no more command than that,
the drone shot away and disappeared from sight
as its camo matched the blue, gray, and white of the sky, sea, and waves.

Wales locked his toolbox and stood up,
folding the false skin back in place over his fingertip.
"Let's watch from inside."

Uncle Jack was chewing the end of his beard as they entered the pilot house.
"Well?" he demanded.

Instead of answering
Wales pressed his palm against the nearest corner of the control panel.
The images from the ship's cameras slid aside to make room for a larger one.

Seen from on high through a fisheye lens,
the ocean looked like a crumpled sheet of gray plastic.
The irregular lines running diagonally across it were wave crests,
and the speck near the bottom was the *Guinevere*.
There was nothing around them but emptiness.

"Have you sent a distress call?" Wales asked quietly.

Uncle Jack scowled.
"Nearest shout I got back is a hundred kay east,
but they're smaller'n we are an' too scared to fight.
Halley wasn't much interested 'til I told them our friends looked military.
Then they made noises about looking into it and dropped off comms.
And then the shaddin' *comms* dropped out."
He jabbed a finger at a small image in the corner of the control panel
that was blinking an orange warning.
Whoever was hunting them was blocking their transmissions.
They were on their own.

"All right, let's get a look at you," Wales said under his breath.
He slid his hand across the control panel again.
The scene shifted as the drone tilted its camera forward and narrowed its focus
to zoom in on a dark blur on the ocean below.
Its outline remained blurry even as it grew larger.
That was its camo,
Iffy guessed---thousands of micro-thin strips of smart material
absorbing and re-emitting light,
infrared,
radar,
and everything else that might give reveal the ship's position and profile.
The flurries of multi-colored speckles
that swept across the image every few seconds
were the camo's electronics at work,
doing for the intruder what she hoped Wales' gear was doing for the *Guinevere*.

Even blurred,
the ship was a frightening sight,
long and lean and four times the *Guinevere*'s size,
the narrow V of her wake betraying the power of her engines.

"Saints and their mercies!"
Aunt Naggie exclaimed from behind Iffy,
a tray of tea mugs in her arms.
"That's the bloody *Taroona*!"

As if in answer a splash of text began scrolling next to the image.
*Glenunga*-class combat transport...
active keel...
modified infrared profile...
modified camouflage...
The words solidified into a spider-web of facts and guesswork
as the *Guinevere*'s core tried to make sense of what it was seeing.

Iffy opened her mouth to ask Wales
if the Australians were after him or the gear in his toolboxes,
then closed it.
Now wasn't the time,
especially not with Uncle Jack there.

"How fast can that thing of yours move?"
Uncle Jack asked as the ship swelled on the screen.

"Mach three and change," Wales replied. "Hang on."

The image tilted and swooped as the drone dove toward the sea below,
levelling off at the last moment to skim the tops of the waves.
A trio of graphs appeared at the top of the control panel.
Wales cursed under his breath.

"What now?" Uncle Jack demanded.

"Some kind multipath radar rig," Wales muttered.

"Is that bad?" Iffy asked anxiously.

"It means they can tell someone's looking at them,
but they can't have a lock.
I hope," Wales amended grimly.
"And there she is,
the pride of the Tasmanian fleet."
The *Taroona*'s outline suddenly came into focus
as the drone got close enough
for its tiny core to see through the ship's dazzle.

"Murder in high heels is what she is," Uncle Jack growled.
The stubby frames of railguns bristled at her bow and stern.
The large tube amidships had to be some sort of EM pulse cannon,
Iffy guessed---at least,
that's what it would be if this was a sim.
But the most frightening thing was what *wasn't* there:
no flag,
no call numbers,
nothing to give her any sort of identity.
Not even her name,
so defiantly displayed when she was tied up in Halley.
She was hunting now,
not swaggering.

Without warning the display went blank.
"What now?" Uncle Jack demanded as the image re-formed.

"Laser burst," Wales said curtly.
"The drone's core is shielded,
but another hit like that will fry the ionizers.
No way they did that from so far out.
They must have a cutter in the water
or something in the air I can't spot.
I'm going to pull back."
Even as he spoke, the *Taroona* began to dwindle.

"Dammit!" Uncle Jack slapped the controls in frustration.
"There's no way we can outrun them."

Wales drummed his fingers on the control panel.
"Maybe we don't have too."
A swirl of false-colored oranges and pinks bloomed on the control panel.
A heavy line marked the shore
and a pair of dots marked the *Guinevere* and her pursuer.

Wales pointed at a splotch of pink between the two dots.
"There---there's a ridge about two hundred meters down.
Seismology detected a mudslide this morning,
and there's been bubbling since."
He glanced at the *Guinevere*'s captain.
"It's a sea boil waiting to happen," he translated.
"If it blows, it'll slow her down or scare her off."

"If?" Uncle Jack spat.
"If don't help us now!"

"Leave that to me," Wales said.
Thin white lines appeared and disappeared on the display
as he and the *Guinevere*'s core explored a thousand possible futures.
After a couple of seconds
their criss-cross confusion locked into place.
Wales tapped the image.
"That's our best chance.
Head for these coordinates.
I'll update them as I get more data from the drone."

"Never thought I'd be steerin' *into* a boil," Uncle Jack grumbled
as he bent the *Guinevere*'s path to port.
He grabbed a sandwich from Aunt Naggie's tray
and gobbled half in a single hasty bite,
chasing it down with a gulp of tea and a belch.
Wales took a second ceramic mug and sipped its contents.

Aunt Naggie handed Iffy the third.
"I'll be down in the galley," she said.

Uncle Jack eyed Iffy,
clearly expecting her to follow her aunt,
but said nothing when she stayed.
Her tea tasted metallic in her mouth.
It took her a moment to realize that she had bitten her lip.
Her heart was pounding.
This wasn't a sim.
This wasn't anything like a sim.
This was *terrifying*.

Wales grunted beside her.
"She's turning faster than I expected.
I'll update the model."
The white lines on the screen danced and twisted again,
settling quickly back into a pattern as confusing as the original.

Wales grunted again.
"Four minutes to optimal position.
Assuming they're not skewing the sat nav to throw us off track."

Soft green digits in the corner of the control panel counted down the seconds.
The tension in the pilot house stretched
until Iffy thought it would snap like a rubber band.
Uncle Jack's knuckles were white on the wheel,
and she couldn't quite seem to catch her breath.
Even Wales seemed to feel it.
He flew the drone in a back-and-forth sweep,
never too far in front of the Aussie warship
but never letting it close in enough to take another shot with its laser.

Three minutes.
Two.
One.
"Show time," Wales said quietly.
He bowed his head as if in prayer.
The image on the screen steadied as the drone slowed and stopped.
The Aussie ship drew closer,
gray and single-purposed like the shark in Iffy's nature book.

The map on the control panel tilted to show depth.
The ridge on the sea floor lay directly beneath the drone,
orange splashed with warning pink.
"Ten seconds," Wales said.
Before Iffy could ask, "Until what?"
the drone dove straight down into the water.

The image from its cameras dimmed and went black
as the drone left the light behind.
Two white sparks appeared on the map next to *Taroona*
and sped toward the blue dot that marked the drone's position.
"*Ta ma d√©*," Wales swore.

The drone plummeted toward the sea floor as the *Taroona*'s torpedoes closed in,
finally able to get a lock on their target from its trail in the water.
"C'mon c'mon c'mon," Iffy pleaded,
not realizing she was speaking aloud.

The drone's dot disappeared.
A balloon of red light expanded where it had been
as the finger-sized bomb it had carried did what it had been built to do.
The torpedoes tried to curve away, but it was too late.
Their trajectories disappeared as they intersected the expanding red blob.

And then the blob touched the sea floor.
The pink blotch beneath it writhed like like a living thing.
Graphs flashed onto the screen,
probability surfaces dancing in three dimensions
as the *Guinevere*'s core tried to predict what would happen next.

"Uh oh," Wales said softly.
A section of the sea ridge had started sliding slowly into the depths.
Blue lightning flashed along the edges of the mudslide,
bright lines connecting and spreading in a sudden spiderweb fracture.

"Come about," Wales snapped at Uncle Jack. "Now!"

The *Guinevere*'s captain didn't need to be told twice.
"I told you this was a stupid idea!"
he snarled as his hands danced across the controls.

Iffy grabbed the door frame to keep her feet
as the *Guinevere* heeled over to starboard.
"What happened?" she asked.

"Fault line in the ridge," Wales said angrily.
"It wasn't in the survey data and the satellite couldn't see it.
The last bot to scan that area must have---"
He cut himself off and pressed his hand onto the control panel.
The map and graphs were replaced by a grainy image
that zoomed in to show the now-familiar outline of the *Taroona*.
"Hang on!" he ordered as the sea behind them started to bubble.

Iffy couldn't look away.
The mudslide started by the bomb the drone had been carrying
had broken up a field of barely-frozen clathrate ice,
releasing enormous bubbles of methane.
As they rose to the surface they churned the sea into
a froth unable to bear the weight of a ship.

Too late, the *Taroona* realized the danger beneath her.
Her stern dipped, throwing her bow into the air.
She tipped on her side and slid down into the dark unforgiving ocean.

"Saints and their mercies," Uncle Jack said quietly.

But no---there she was, still afloat!
She wasn't a jelly dredger or a cargo hauler.
She had been built to withstand gunfire
and scalpel mines
and the storms of the great southern ocean.
She bobbed and wallowed like an oversized bath toy,
her deadly grace gone,
but as the water that had tried to claim her sluiced off her sides
she turned toward the *Guinevere*.
Twin jets of white steam spurted from her stern as her engines briefly lifted above the waves,
and she surged forward once again.

"Crap," Wales said under his breath.

Uncle Jack said something louder and much worse.
"I knew you were trouble!" he snarled at Wales
as he reached for the control panel.

Wales caught his wrist.
"What are you doing?"

"Cutting the affin' engines!"
Uncle Jack yanked his arm free,
his face as red as Iffy had ever seen it.
"You can't sink 'em and we can't outrun 'em
so the only thing left is to run up the white affin' flag
and hope you're all they take!
And if you ever lay hands to me again on *my* ship, I'll---"

*BOOM!*
Yellow-red flame jetted from the *Taroona*'s side.
Iffy shrieked as a second blurred streak hit the Aussie ship,
then a third,
each striking just above the waterline
as the *Taroona* heeled sideways under the force of the blows.
An explosion inside the ship kicked her sideways like a child's toy.

"Ya killed 'em,"
Iffy whispered unbelievingly
as the *Taroona* broke in two.
She dragged her sleeve across her face.
"Ya killed 'em all.
Why'd ya do that?"

"That wasn't me!"
Wales' hands danced across the control panel.
"Damn it!
I need to get another drone up there."

"No you don't," Uncle Jack said flatly, pointing out the window.

A kilometer, a ship had appeared out of nowhere,
its camo briefly disrupted by the missiles it had launched.
Where the *Taroona* and the *Guinevere* were metal,
the newcomer was made of tweaked bamboo.
Her dozen sails were a tangle of fractal geometry
too complex to be managed or even really understood by a merely human mind.
Her green and yellow pennant with the slogan *Este mundo √© de deus*
proclaimed to all who she was,
while her railguns and missile racks said just as plainly what she had been built for:
war.

"Zillions..." Iffy whispered.
Everyone knew the words on that flag---knew them and feared them.
Brazil had fought beside the rest of humanity when the machines rebelled,
but had turned on their allies once the bots were defeated.
"*Este mundo!*" they screamed in sim after sim,
always the villains.
"This world is God's!"
The earth's self-appointed defenders would sacrifice everything
to undo the damage humanity had done to the Earth.
Whenever a shaft in a coal mine collapsed
people blamed Zillion saboteurs
intent on driving the world back into the stone age.
When a mutant fungus turned the contents of a greenhouse into sludge,
all its owner had to do was say,
"It must have been them!"
for people to demand that the governors *do* something.
And when a Zillion trader was brave enough or stupid enough
to go more than a block or two from Halley's market and woke up in hospital,
everyone just nodded at the Marines' straight-faced apologies
for the inexplicable glitch in their drones' recording
that left them unable to identify anyone who might have been involved.

Even as they watched,
the Zillion ship blurred and vanished once again.
The faint spiderweb tracery of her rigging glinted in the sun,
then it too was gone.
"Why'd they---" Iffy felt lightheaded.
"Why'd they kill 'em?"

"Because they could," Wales replied wearily.
"There's no way they could get past the *Taroona*'s defenses
when she was running at spec,
but knocked off balance the way she was..."
He shrugged.
"They saw a shot and they took it."

"A shot *you* gave 'em," Uncle Jack said accusingly,
quick as always to make sure trouble was someone else's fault.
"There's gonna be hell to pay for this."
He slapped at the control panel to put the *Guinevere* in a tight turn.

"Wait---no! We can't go back for them."
Wales reached for the panel.

Uncle Jack slapped his hand away.
"I'm not leavin' 'em in the affin' water!"

Wales shook his head.
"Look."
Another pink blotch was rising from the ocean floor on the panel in front of them.
It churned and reformed
as the *Guinevere*'s simple-minded sonar tried to make sense of a maelstrom of bubbles.
When it reached the surface the broken remains of the *Taroona* disappeared.

Uncle Jack swore again.
For a moment Iffy thought he was going to hit Wales.
Instead,
he swiped his hand across the control panel to turn them back toward Rothera.

All of a sudden Iffy needed to be somewhere else---anywhere else.
She threw open the door of the pilot house
and stumbled out into the endless hard light of the southern summer.
Her feet took her to the galley on auto-pilot.
She pulled open the hatch and fell into her foster mother's arms.
Aunt Naggie wrapped her meaty arms around her adopted daughter.
"Sweetie, what's wrong?"

"They're dead," Iffy cried.
"They're all sunk an' dead!"

"Oh, sweetie."
Aunt Naggie hugged her tight, rocking her from side to side.
"Oh, sweetie..."
For a moment Iffy thought she heard another voice say,
"I love you so much,"
but no.
There were just her sobs
and the hum of the engines
and the muffled sound of the uncaring sea.

## Chapter 4

Her tears eventually stopped, as tears always do.
After allowing her foster mother one last hug,
Iffy left Aunt Naggie in the galley
and sat on the thwart at the *Guinevere*'s stern,
gray thoughts chasing each other aimlessly in her head.
She half-hoped that Wales would sit with her
so that she could be curt with him,
but instead, he disappeared into his storage-locker cabin,
ignoring Uncle Jack's angry questions about
what the hell a civilian was doing with a bomb in his affin' luggage.
*Wait 'til you find out about the other ones,* she thought dully.

Sunk in misery,
it took her a moment to realize that something was moving above the horizon.
She stood and shaded her eyes,
squinting against the dazzle from the waves
until she was sure she was seeing the wispy smudge of a spotter drone's gossamer wings.
Why was it approaching from the west?
Halley lay east of them.
Unless---
"Uncle Jack!" she shouted,
sprinting toward the pilot house.
"Uncle Jack, it's the Zillions! They're comin' back for us!"

"Hang on a sec," her uncle said
to a face on to the control panel as she charged in.
"What?"

"Uncle Jack," she panted.
"There's a Zillion spotter comin' in!"

"That ain't Zillion," her uncle said scornfully.
"It's outta Rothera."
He jerked his thumb at the face on the screen.
"Lady here says they been lookin' for us.
Or leastways, they been lookin' for our passenger.
Seems he's quite a popular fellow."

Iffy looked from her uncle to the screen.
An old woman smiled back warmly.
Her brown face was lined with a century of wrinkles,
and what was left of her hair
was pulled back tightly across against her scalp
in a style that Iffy had only ever seen in her history class.
"Hello," the face said.
"You must be Miz Kwan.
I'm Doctor Johel.
I'm looking forward to meeting you."

They reached Rothera two days later.
The spotter traced lazy circles above them the whole way,
its insect-eye cameras and microscopic core
searching ceaselessly for signs of trouble.
Each time Wales emerged from his cabin
to get some tea or use the toilet,
it swooped closer to the *Guinevere*
like a gull that had spotted someone eating a sandwich.
Wales paid more no attention to it than he did Iffy and her foster parents.
"Good morning", "excuse me", and "no thank you"
were all he seemed to have the energy to say.

But Iffy was fascinated.
Skies the world over had been off limits since the end of the war---even
China-over-the-Sea couldn't watch the whole world all the time,
but anything bigger much larger than a single person
ran the risk of being fried from orbit.
A few heavily armored aircraft still flew short missions here and there,
but for most of humanity,
anything more than a short ground-hugging flight
had once more become the stuff of dreams.
The drone was the biggest winged craft Iffy had ever seen up close,
and she spent every moment she could steal studying it
through a high-powered monocular.
Truth be told,
there wasn't much else to do.

They threaded their way through the narrow passage
between Adelaide Island and the Antarctic Peninsula,
past mats of tweaked seaweed left over from someone's failed attempt to start a sea farm,
and there it was:
Rothera.
The capital of Australia's Antarctic territory
was ten times the size of Halley,
home port for the fleet that glared across the Drake Passage
at the southernmost tip of South America
and the Zillion marauders who called it home.

A pair of sleek sentry torpedoes surfaced beside them
as they rounded the rocky point
where the scavenged remains of the first research station stood.
Normally bustling with warships, freighters, jelly dredgers, tugs, and water taxis,
Rothera's harbor seemed unnaturally quiet.
"Governor's orders," Aunt Naggie told Iffy,
passing her a hard-boiled egg liberally dusted with curry powder.
"That's what Jack says---everyone's been told
to stay outta the way 'til we tie up.
Whatever Mister Wales did scared 'em all pretty hard."

Her meager lunch inside her,
Iffy went back on deck.
She was surprised to see Wales leaning on the railing,
his eyes as distant as his thoughts.
Iffy hesitated,
thinking about all the times she'd tried to make friends with people
only to put her foot in her mouth,
then stepped up to the railing a meter away from him and leaned on it as well.

He looked sideways at her.
"I'm sorry for what happened."

"No worries," she said.
Together, they watched the shore approach.

"You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy,"
Wales sighed.

Iffy bridled. "It ain't that bad."

Wales chuckled.
"It's a quote from an old sim.
And no, it isn't that bad."
His half-smile slipped slightly.
"Or at least, it didn't used to be."

Thin trails of soot drew diagonal charcoal lines across the sky above the city
as the *Guinevere* approached.
Iffy glanced at Wales,
but he showed no emotion at the sight.
The Peninsula's coal mines were the original source of Rothera's wealth,
the reason both for the governor being there
and for the Zillions' prowling and raids.
It was a crime to burn fossil fuel in most parts of the world,
including Australia,
but when pressed about their seemingly endless exemptions,
Rothera's citizens shrugged and said, "Damage done,"
or pointed out that the whole of Antarctica would still be covered in ice
if it weren't for the warming.
And if cities elsewhere had drowned
and people had starved
or been driven from their homes in the years before the machine wars,
well,
that damage was done too.

When the wind shifted,
the city's smell hit Iffy like a wet hammer.
Rothera didn't just have coal mines---its dredging fleet
was ten times the size of Halley's.
The reek of tonnes of jellyfish being rendered down for fuel and fertilizer
was like being hit hard with a pillow.
Wales wrinkled his nose in disgust,
but Iffy took a deep breath,
held it until she thought her lungs might burst,
and let it out in a whoosh.
That stink meant Rothera,
and Rothera meant Honesty,
and Honesty meant---well,
Iffy was still trying to work exactly what Honesty meant.

The torpedoes peeled away as they entered the harbor
to resume their endless patrol.
The spotter drone overhead banked and turned back out to sea a few moments later,
the sun sparkling off the solar cells in its wings.
Iffy watched it go,
wishing she too could watch everything
with the detachment of an angel or a satellite.

A squad of Marines was waiting for them on the pier.
Four stood in a semi-circle around the old woman who had spoken to them two days earlier.
An armored bot the size of the *Guinevere*'s pilot house loomed behind them.
Someone had turned the "0" of the "G-80" stencilled on the bot's side
into a scowling face.
The rest of the Marines were scattered among crates and machines
or on the decks of nearby ships,
their positions chosen after a millisecond of high-intensity simulation by the city's core.
Other than them, the pier was deserted.
So were the piers on either side, Iffy realized.

"Sharks in the water," Wales murmured beside her
as a mechanical shape twice the size of the sentry torpedoes swam beneath them.
"And that G-80 on the pier isn't just for show."
He nodded almost imperceptibly toward the hulking bot.
"See its treads? They've been reinforced for urban work."
He looked past Iffy as Aunt Naggie came on deck
to put her arm around Iffy's shoulders
and gave her foster daughter a wordless squeeze of reassurance.
"I'm sorry for all this."

Aunt Naggie shrugged.
"Prob'ly be sorrier if we were dead."

The *Guinevere* slowed and turned parallel to the pier.
Iffy shrugged off her aunt's arm
and hurried forward to throw a line to a waiting Marine.
As he caught it,
another Marine leaped across the gap to the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Despite the weight of his exoskeleton,
his boots made no more sound hitting the deck than a seagull flapping its wings.

Uncle Jack strode onto the deck and put his hands on his hips.
"Well," he said to no one in particular.
"Let's get this over with."
With one final glare at Wales
he let the gangplank thud onto the pier
and stumped down to meet their welcoming committee.

Wales stepped aside to let Aunt Naggie follow her husband
and then picked up the toolbox with the purple square on the end.
"How about you bring those?" he said to Iffy,
nodding at the two remaining toolboxes.
"And stay close---as long as we don't startle anyone,
everything will be fine."

Iffy hesitated.
"It's normal for an apprentice to carry their teacher's gear,"
Wales explained gently.
Iffy nodded jerkily and followed him down the gangplank with one box in each hand.

Doctor Johel stepped forward to greet them.
"Mister Wales," she said warmly,
extending her hand.
"Such a pleasure to see you again."
Her clipped accent was straight out of an old story sim,
and her eyes actually sparkled as she and Wales shook hands.

"And you, doctor."
Wales bowed his head slightly before releasing her hand.
"My apologies for the trouble I must have caused."

"No apology necessary," Doctor Johel said briskly.
"Pirates are pirates no matter who's flag they fly,
and it's useful to know
that the Brazilians are able to get that close without being detected."

Wales inclined his head again.
"As you say." He hesitated.
"Do you know how many were lost?"

The tiny woman's expression didn't soften.
"I'm afraid not.
And even if we did,
Intelligence might not share that information."

"And Miz Kwan," she continued smoothly,
turning to Iffy and holding out her hand again.
"A pleasure to meet you as well.
I'm grateful to you for helping Mister Wales get here in one piece."

"No worries," Iffy mumbled,
setting down the toolboxes and shaking Doctor Johel's hand gingerly.
The old woman was half a head shorter than Iffy,
and her wrinkled brown skin felt like warm plastic.
Up close,
the sparkle in her eyes was more than just a trick of the light,
but Iffy couldn't tell if she was tweaked
or if the gleaming motes were some kind of tech.

"And I'm Jack Ng, thank you for asking," Uncle Jack broke in,
stepping forward and thrusting out his hand.
"I'm the captain of the *Guinevere*,
an' all I want to know is,
how soon can I get back on th' water where I belong?"

"I'm sure the governor will tell you that when you see him,"
Doctor Johel said,
pointedly ignoring his hand.

"When I what? I'm not---will you stop pestering me, woman?"
He shrugged Aunt Naggie's cautioning hand off his arm angrily.
"I'm not talkin' to th' governor!
I was hired for a job, plain an' simple.
I just want paid an' then I'm done with it."

"That will be for the governor to decide,"
Doctor Johel said,
a hint of steel in her voice.
"Now, if you'll come this way?"
She turned toward shore.
The armored bot pivoted smoothly and almost silently on its heavy treads
and lowered one of its arms.
The elderly doctor sat on it as if were a park bench---as if
being carried gently along a pier by a century-old war machine
was the most natural thing in the world.

"Show-off," Uncle Jack grumbled.
"Treatin' that thing like it's some kind o' pet rat."

"Actually,
she trained its core on a sim of a guard dog she once had,"
Wales said drily.
He picked up his toolbox and nudged Iffy with his elbow.
"Come along, my young apprentice.
Our day's not over yet."

Two dozen people stood waiting at the base of the pier
under the watchful eyes of yet another squad of Marines.
Iffy recognized some of them
as crew from the ships tied up on either side of the *Guinevere*.
Iffy's cheeks burned under their curious, resentful stares.
One or two nodded to them
but no one said hello.

They followed Doctor Johel and the G-80 to the harbor gate,
where a bus the same navy blue as the Marines' uniforms waited for them.
The G-80 stood motionless as Doctor Johel got to her feet.
"After you," she said,
gesturing at the bus's open door.
Wales inclined his head once again and climbed aboard
with Iffy, Uncle Jack, and Aunt Naggie behind him.

"I haven't been in one of these in years," Wales said,
seating himself near the front with his toolbox at his feet.

"I ain't never been in one," Iffy confessed
as she sat on the other side of the aisle from him.
"They must think pretty highly o' you to lay on such a fuss."

Wales laughed humorlessly and nudged his toolbox with his boot.
"I suspect that what they think highly of is this.
And if they thought they could take it away from me without consequences,
I'm pretty sure our welcome would have been much less friendly."
He raised an eyebrow at Doctor Johel.
The old woman smiled sweetly from the seat in front of him but said nothing.

Rothera bustled around them once the bus left the dock behind.
They hummed quietly through the city streets
and up the long, gentle slope that led to the governor's mansion.
The G-80 stayed five meters in front of them,
its twin turrets swivelling each time they went through an intersection.
The Marines jogged along on either side with long mechanical strides.
Traffic pulled aside to let them pass,
but Iffy didn't see any of the mad scramble
that a convoy like theirs would cause in Halley.
Her heart skipped a beat once
when she thought she saw a familiar face in the crowd,
but then the girl turned her head and she realized it was someone else.

As they drew closer to the governor's mansion,
the three-story cinderblock buildings thrown up to house refugees after the war
gave way to newer, brighter construction.
Foamed glass reflected blue sky and spindly anti-drone laser towers.
Iffy pressed her face against the window
and stared hungrily at the greenhouses nestled among the turrets' feet.
Mangoes and oranges and flowers---flowers!---made
a green riot beneath the sheltering panels.
Little Mrs. Sandhu claimed that the governor even grew bananas,
though Big Mrs. Sandhu scoffed at the notion.
"They been 'stinct longer than we been alive,"
she said in a tone that brooked no argument.

Iffy's stomach suddenly rumbled.
Doctor Johel smiled at her.
"I'm sure lunch will be served," she promised.

"Thanks," Iffy mumbled,
feeling her foster father's glare on her back.
Suddenly resentful of his disapproval,
she asked, "So what kind o' doctor are you?"

"The medical kind, originally," the old woman replied,
turning in her seat so that she was fully facing Iffy.
"But I've been focused on physics and engineering for the last few years.
There's still a lot of technology left over from the machine wars
that we don't understand,
and it's my department's job to secure it.
Or destroy it," she continued,
raising her wispy eyebrows at Wales.
He smiled as if Doctor Johel had paid him a compliment.

A wrought iron fence surrounded the governor's mansion.
Sleek robotic sentries paced back and forth behind it,
their blunt conical heads swivelling to track the approaching vehicles.

The G-80 pulled to the side to let the bus go through its single gate,
but the Marines stayed beside them all the way to
the turnaround in front of the mansion's main doors.
A triangular diamond wedge glistened in the center of the gravel circle,
familiar to Iffy from dozens of pictures.
"In memory" was engraved on each of its faces.
In memory of those lost when the ice melted and the sea rose.
In memory of those who fell fighting the machines in the war that followed.
In memory of all the species now extinct,
the giraffes and tigers and all the others that now existed only in books and sims.
Iffy paused a moment as she came out of the bus to look at it,
a strange ache in her chest as she wondered
who was remembering the crew of the *Taroona*.

"Get along with you," Uncle Jack growled,
nudging her brusquely.
Flanked by Marines,
they followed Doctor Johel through the mansion's doors.

And then waited.
Iffy wasn't sure what she had been expecting,
but sitting on a comfortable couch with potted plants on either side
and soft music playing in the background
wasn't it.
Uncle Jack kept his arms crossed and muttered to himself incessantly,
glaring at Aunt Naggie when she ventured that the governor must be very busy,
really,
it wasn't surprising that he couldn't see them right away,
and she was sure he wouldn't be much longer.

Wales didn't seem bothered by the wait.
At one point Iffy thought he had actually fallen asleep,
but then he grimaced and opened his eyes.
"They're locked down tight," he sighed quietly,
tapping the tech in his temple with a finger.

Iffy nodded toward the toolboxes on the floor between them.
"Least they let you keep your gear."

Wales smiled. "They didn't really have---ah, here we go."
He stood and brushed his hands on his trousers
as the door across from them swung open with soft pneumatic whoosh.
It and the wall were as thick as Iffy's slab mattress.
Armor?
Soundproofing?
She didn't have time to wonder before Doctor Johel beckoned them to join her.
"The governor will see you now," she said.
"But I'm afraid you'll have to leave those here."

"Of course." Wales nudged the toolbox under the bench with his boot.
"Shall we say...half an hour?"

"I should think that would be adequate," Doctor Johel replied.
She stepped to the side and beckoned them through.

"Half an hour 'til what?" Iffy whispered to Wales.

"Until it decides I'm not coming back and makes a fuss about it,"
he whispered back.

The windowless office Doctor Johel showed them into
was not much smaller than the room they had been waiting in.
Framed photographs on the walls traced the history of Rothera
from its early days as a research station
through the opening of the mines
and its years as a labor camp
for people that the revolutionary government in far-off London didn't want at home
but didn't want to get rid of---at least, not yet.
The largest picture was of the Union Jack being raised in Hobart
after London fell to the machines.
A smaller one beneath it showed what was left of city,
drowned and abandoned.

A plain wooden desk stood near one wall
with half a dozen simple wooden chairs in front of it.
A single Marine with a shaved head gestured for them all to sit
and then studied them for a heartbeat before saying,
"All clear, sir."

"Thank you, sergeant."
The words seemed to come out of thin air.
Iffy's jaw dropped as the air behind the desk shimmered
to reveal a tall man in a formal dark turtleneck,
slightly stooped with age but still strong,
his face exactly like the picture that hung in the Sandhu's grocery store.

"As you were," Governor Stern said pleasantly,
waving Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie back into their seats as they started to rise.
He nodded at Doctor Johel,
sat somewhat stiffly behind his desk,
and steepled his fingers.
"Thank you for coming.
I trust your trip here from the docks was less eventful
than your encounter with our Brazilian neighbors?"

The room was silent as everyone waited for Wales to reply.
When it became clear he wasn't going to,
Uncle Jack cleared his throat.
"Er, yes, your honor, clear skies 'n' smooth sailin'."
He bobbed his head.
"Glad t' help.
Happy to, any time you need."

The governor nodded his head gravely.
"Thank you, Captain Ng.
The government appreciates your service.
And you, Mister Wales," he continued,
looking directly at the American for the first time.
"Will you be happy to help too?"

Wales never got to answer.
Something screamed outside,
a shrill mechanical sound that ended in the flat crack of an explosion.
A dozen pop-up displays instantly materialized above the desk
to show aerial views and schematics splashed with red danger markers.
The Marine took two steps forward
and pressed the tip of a stiffened finger against Wales' head.
He raised his hands.
"It's not mine!" he protested.
"It's not mine!"

Half a dozen Marines poured through the door behind them.
"Sir, it's the G-80," the one in the lead said,
urgent but calm.
"It---"
A second shriek and *crack!* cut off the rest of his sentence.
"You need to evacuate, sir," the Marine continued.

A section of the wall behind the governor's desk slid sideways
to reveal a ramp leading down into the bedrock below the mansion.
The governor stayed where he was.
A single swipe of his hand
enlarged a top-down display of the front of the mansion
just as the hulking warbot fire another micro-missile
at the swarm of robotic swarming around it.
Shriek---*crack!*
The explosion threw a shattered sentry twenty meters.
The G-80 pivoted on its treads,
swinging it arms like clubs to knock another sentry into the air.

"Doctor?" the governor asked calmly.
"You told me its core was secure."

"It was," she replied, her voice icy instead of calm.
"Mister Wales?"

"This has nothing to do with me," Wales replied,
his his head tilted slightly under the pressure of the Marine's gun finger
against the tech in his temple.

"Sir---" the Marine began again.

"In a moment," the governor said sharply.
A pair of sentries charged their larger opponent simultaneously.
The G-80 knocked the first one away and grabbed the second with its heavy square claws.

The image flashed blue for a moment.
"EMP?" Doctor Johel gasped disbelievingly.
"It doesn't have a pulse generator!"

The image reformed.
The G-80 dropped the sentry it had torn in half.
The other sentry bots stood frozen in a circle around it for a moment.
Then,
as one,
the G-80 and the sentries turned toward the mansion.
The last thing Iffy saw before her aunt dragged her away
was the sentries leaping through the hole
made by the G-80 plowing through the mansion's front door.

"Breach!" one of the younger Marines shouted.

"Really?" Wales muttered sarcastically,
his hands still in the air.

<!--

The Marine holding the gun to his head nudged him toward the opening behind the
governor's desk. "Sir, if you would?"

Wales didn't move. "Not without those toolboxes."

This time the Marine's nudge was more of a shove. "Sir, we can come back
for---"

"If it takes more than twenty-two minutes for us to come back, there won't be
anything for us to come back to," Wales said sharply, his feet planted.
"Doctor?"

Doctor Johel and the governor exchanged looks. "Get them," the governor ordered
crisply.

"Sir, we can't bring his tech into the secure area without testing it," the
sergeant protested.

"Mister Wales?" The governor raised an eyebrow.

"Safe as houses," Wales promised. "You have my word."

After that, everything moved quickly. One Marine opened the door and tossed a
thumb-sized camera drone into the waiting room. When it wasn't fried by a laser
or blown to pieces by a needle gun, a second Marine bent low in a starter's
crouch, took a deep breath, and flung himself through the door. Something
sizzled across the shoulder of his exoskeleton a millisecond before he crashed
into the couch that Iffy had been sitting on just a few minutes earlier. He
rolled over clumsily. "Left scapular is bacon," he called. Iffy had only a
heartbeat to wonder why why he said "bacon" instead of "baked" before he flung
the first of the toolboxes she had been carrying back through the door.

His partner caught it and set it down just in time to catch the second one.
"Wait!" Wales ordered as the Marine in the waiting room reached for the third
toolbox. He closed his eyes for a moment and then nodded. "Now!"

The third toolbox flew through the air. The Marine who had thrown it crouched,
took a deep breath, and threw himself after it.

Whatever had shot him the first time had been patient, and now its patience was
rewarded. A perfectly straight line of blue light flashed just long enough to
leave an after-image on Iffy's eyes. The Marine landed in a crumpled heap on
the floor of the governor's office. His exoskeleton tried to stand, its
programming still trying to anticipate its wearer's likely moves, but it
couldn't lift the dead weight it now held.

"Oh saints," Aunt Naggie whispered.

The Marine who had caught the toolboxes didn't hesitate---didn't even really
seem to notice how her partner didn't move as she pulled his battery and two
clips of ammunition from his body. *It's his conditioning,* Iffy thought.
*Like Jeep when he came back. He just don't feel it.* She swallowed hard to
stop herself from throwing up.

The Marines herded everyone down the stairs behind the governor's desk into a
narrow zig-zag corridor that smelled of sweat and machinery. Pipes ran along
the ceiling, a color-coded mix of water, sewage, secure optical cabling, and
highways for the rat-sized repair bots that were now scurrying madly to the
mansion's defense.

"Any theories, doctor?" the governor asked from the head of the little
procession.

"No idea," Doctor Johel puffed, struggling to keep the pace. "Nobody
ever... managed... to breach the firewalls... on the G-80s... during the war.
And if someone... has a way... to infect... the sentries..."

"It was optical," Wales cut in. "That flash. It wasn't an EMP. It was some
kind of machine hypnosis."

"Shall we discuss this later, sirs?" the Marine sergeant said, her tone making
it clear that she wasn't actually asking a question.

Something chattered behind them. Sharp dots stitched across the concrete above
their heads. "Affin' hell!" Uncle Jack roared.

Needle guns crackled behind them again as two of the Marines turned and returned
fire. "Go!" the sergeant ordered, shoving them one by one through the door at
the end of the corridor.

Wales stumbled and went down on one knee. "Sorry," he gasped. Dark red blood
spurted from twin punctures where a stray needle had punched through his thigh.

The sergeant took his arm and began to drag him forward. "No!" Wales shook her
off. "The failsafe... It thinks I'm wounded..." To Iffy's horror, the purple
square on the end of the toolbox had started blinking.

"Cover me!" Wales ordered the sergeant. Without waiting to see if she did, he
opened the toolbox and began pulling parts out.

"What the hell are you doing? Sir?" the Marine demanded incredulously.

"Start where you are," Wales muttered. "Start where you are, use what you have,
help who you can." Two skeletal legs, a wheel of nested gears only slightly
smaller than Iffy's hand, a complicated not-quite-a-box to hold it all
together---all of a sudden Iffy could see the parts in her head and how they had
to fit together.

"Lemme do that," she said as Wales's shaking hands dropped a thumb-sized
cylinder on the floor. She twisted two already-assembled parts around,
tightened them, and clipped the cylinder into place. "It'll be more stable like
this."

Wales handed her more parts without hesitation or question. When she handed the
newly-made bot back to him he turned it over for one last check and then flung
it at the wall. Its gyroscopic gearwheel spinning madly, the little machine
scampered up to the ceiling.

"If that's a bomb---" the sergeant began.

"Directional broadband pulse," Wales panted as the little machine disappeared
around the corner. "It'll blind them for sure, knock them out if we're lucky."

*I know that,* Iffy realized incredulously. How could I know that? How did I
*know how to put it together?*

Wales struggled to his feet, swaying slightly before putting a hand on the wall
to steady himself. Blood was no longer pumping out of his leg, but when he
tried to take a step he almost collapsed. "Here," the sergeant said. She
switched her gun to her other hand and slipped under his shoulder.

The lights went out. Iffy's heart skipped a beat even as they flickered back to
life. "That's one," Wales grunted. He hopped forward on his good leg, gasping
as his toolbox bumped against the wounded one. The purple light on its end was
still blinking.

Mechanical claws scraped on the concrete behind them. Iffy spun around as a
lone sentry came around the corner. The now-empty micro-missile launcher on its
back gave it a hunched appearance, and the fresh scratches on its side where the
mansion's mechanical rats had clawed at it made its camouflage flicker and jump.
Twin needle guns on the sides of its head chattered, their ammunition spent.

The Marine pushed Wales away and fired two quick shots. The sentry jerked as
the shaped needles pinged off one of its mechanical knees. With a sound that
could almost have been a growl it threw itself at them.

A small shape dropped from the ceiling and landed on its back. Iffy had just a
moment to recognize Wales' toy bear before the lights went out again. One
second, two, three... When they came back to life the sentry lay motionless on
its side. The toy bear stood over it, the blue light in its eyes fading,
fading, gone.

"Could you... could you please get that?" Wales asked Iffy weakly as he slumped
down against the wall. "I have a feeling we might need it again."

Iffy only managed two steps before the world swam around her. She heard Wales
call her name, but it was as if he was speaking from unimaginably far away.
Everything seemed distant and somehow tilted, the way it had the one time she
had tried drinking some of Uncle Jack's rum. She turned slowly, impossibly
slowly, wondering who had replaced the walls with schematics. "That conduit is
going to start leaking if someone doesn't mend it," she tried to say, but the
words wouldn't come out, and even if they did, Wales and the Marine had been
replaced by schematics too.

She woke up lying on a couch in yet another windowless office. Something about
the damp air told her she was underground. She turned her head. "Hey,
sweetie," Aunt Naggie said, her soft voice and the gentle hand she put on her
foster daughter's forehead completely failing to disguise her worry or relief.

"Hey," Iffy replied. She started to sit up, but let her aunt stop her with only
a mumbled protest.

She turned her head at the sound of voices. A medic with two tech fingers on
her right hand was patching Wales up on another couch while the governor
interrogated him. No, Wales repeated wearily, he had no idea how the G-80 had
been compromised, or how it had infected the sentries. He had just been
guessing when he said it was some sort of machine hypnosis. No, he wouldn't
show them what else he had in his toolbox---not yet. And yes, he did realize
that made him look like he was hiding something. "But that's because I am," he
said, eyeing his cut-off trouser leg sadly. He hadn't flinched when the medic
probed his wound with a whisker-slim instrument extruded from one of her metal
fingers, or when she started to fill the hole with pink goo from a squeeze tube.

"The question is what?" The governor paced restlessly as he spoke. "What kind
of man has a fully functional mil sat link in his head, tactical antimatter
bombs in his luggage, and an unregistered clone as an apprentice?"

Iffy froze at the word "clone". It was something other children had called her
when she was little to make her cry, something Uncle Jack muttered just loudly
enough to be overheard when he was in a particularly bad mood. "Nothin' to be
ashamed of," Aunt Naggie said firmly the one time Iffy talked to her about it.
"Y'are who y'are, an' I love who y'are, and that's the all of it."

But the word didn't seem to register with Wales, or maybe he just didn't care.
He pushed the medic's hands away. "I'm the sort of man who can change the world
for you," he said firmly.

Governor Stern pivoted to face him. "Oh really?" His eyes sparkled the same
way as Doctor Johel's, Iffy suddenly realized, but there in that underground
room it was scary instead of magical.

"Really." Wales straightened up with a wince. "Or at least, give you the tools
you need to do it yourself." When the governor raised an eyebrow, he continued,
"There's a research base at the foot of Mount Tyree, a couple of hundred klicks
inland from Paddington South. It was under the ice sheet when it was built, but
there's been enough melt to expose the entrance."

The governor's fingers drummed on his thighs. His eyes sparkled again---some
kind of direct visual input shining light straight into his retinas, Iffy
guessed. "All right, there's a base," he said as whatever he had just seen
confirmed what Wales had just said. "But it was cleared out years ago. And
anyway, everybody who was anybody built some kind of secret lab down here. What
makes this one special?"

"It wasn't cleared out. And it was never really a lab. Or at least, not just a
lab." Wales locked eyes with Doctor Johel. "It was a backup ground station for
the Niobium satellite network. And as far as I can tell, it's still
functional."

"That's ridiculous," Doctor Johel said, as calmly as if she ordering a cup of
tea. "Governor, I was part of the last team that tried to reactivate Niobium.
I spent years digging into the records, and there was no hint in any of them of
a backup station."

The governor raised a hand to interrupt her. "Convince me," he ordered Wales.

Wales closed his eyes and reeled off a list of coordinates. The numbers meant
nothing to Iffy, but from the looks on Governor Stern's and Doctor Johel's
faces, they recognized at least some of them. "I can bring up your drones,
too," Wales said when he was done. "If we can get to the base, you can see
everything the Brazilians have, every moment of the day."

"And you're just going to give that to us out of the goodness of your heart?"
the governor asked pointedly.

Wales smiled wanly. "Of course not." He nodded to the medic. "Tell him what
you found."

The medic looked at the governor for permission. When the old man nodded, she
said, "He's been tweaked, sir. Oxygen uptake, metabolic efficiency, chromatin
structure---it'll take a while to sort it all out."

Governor Stern cocked his head to the side. "And?" Every tenth person in
Antarctica had some sort of tweak, most of them inherited from grandparents or
great-grandparents who had been early settlers or suffered from genetic
disorders or whose own parents had more money than good sense.

"And every once in a while I need a reboot," Wales said. He tapped the tech in
his temple. "This was designed for baseline human physiology. It doesn't get
along with my upgrades as well as I'd like. If I don't re-set every few years,
my nervous system starts to shut down. I used to be able to get it fixed in
Nairobi, but since the civil war re-started..." He shrugged. "As far as I
know, that base is the last place on Earth with the gear I need."

The governor nodded slowly. "Interesting." He communed for a moment with the
city core, then nodded again. "All right. Sergeant?"

"Yes sir," the Marine said, speaking for the first time since she, Wales, and
Iffy had survived the sentry's attack.

"Take these three back to their ship. Just until I decide what to do next," he
continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth. "You can resupply while you wait, at
city expense. Mister Wales, you'll be my guest here."

"An' what if we decide we'd rather not stick around?" Uncle Jack demanded,
belligerent once again now that the danger had passed. "You gonna put
*surveillance* on us t' make sure we stay put?"

Iffy gulped. Aunt Naggie gasped, and even the Marine grunted despite her
conditioning. Computer cores had watched people every moment of every day for
years in the run-up to their rebellion. Humanity had designed them to do that,
and had come close to extinction as a result. Children learned that
surveillance was evil at the same as they were potty trained. Accusing someone
of doing it was a lot even by Uncle Jack's standards.

"I don't think surveillance will be necessary," the governor said evenly. "But
I *will* post a Marine or two at the docks, and you really shouldn't try to
leave until our business is concluded. I trust that will be acceptable."
Without waiting for an answer to what hadn't actually been a question he turned
and left.

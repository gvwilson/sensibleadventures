*He walked into my mother's camp one morning as if he was family.
We had watched him trudge toward us across the spring-green tundra all morning.
My grandfather said that
anyone without enough courtesy to sit at a polite distance and wait for an invitation
should be turned away,
but my mother made him welcome.*

*She almost changed her mind when he pulled back the hood on his parka.
He looked like something from a fever dream---his hair and beard were yellow,
and his nose was like a puffin's beak.*

*He smiled and said something in a strange language,
then laughed when we spoke to him in our own.
By the time summer came he and I were learning to wrestle spirits together.
That is how Saknus Heraldsson came to the Nukilik.*

---

Luft Berendsson has given up cursing the cold
by the time he finds the door he is looking for.
He closes it carefully behind him
and descends three stairs made from salvaged shipboards
into the shack's one sunken room.

"I said three, and I mean three!"
The trader settles back on her stool and nods a curt hello
as Luft crosses the packed earth floor to the pit stove
and pulls off his mittens.

The Nukilik puts the knife back on the counter and shoulders his pack.
"Three blue rabbit furs are enough for a hand of such knives.
Good weather."
He pulls the hood of his parka over his long dark hair
and leaves without a backward glance.

"Stupid sealfuckers."
The trader does not sound angry.
"I miss proper haggling."

Luft pulls his own hood back and seats himself across the table from her.
"I take it you don't like our round-faced friends?"

The trader notes the man's crumpled nose,
the beaded braids in his red beard,
and the sword belted around the poorly-stitched parka
that is two sizes too large for his small frame.
*A good luck charm,*
she thinks,
*If he buys anything, it'll be charm.*
"Oh,
they're all right,"
she says aloud,
taking a small wooden box from the shelf behind her
and setting it casually on the table between them.
"These three years gone, when ice locked the harbour early?
We'd have most of us starved if Walker and his folk hadn't helped us out."

"Walker? The local chief?"

"Eh, that was him just here."
The trader gestures toward the door
with the misshapen piece of ivory she has taken out of the box.
It is no more magical than a lump of snot,
but start low and work your way up,
her mother used to say,
start low and then show them something better.
"Comes into town every couple of months with the best furs anyone's ever seen,
or a rack of antlers wider than you can spread your arms.
The rest of the locals think he's---hoy!"
The short southerner has taken the steps three at a time
without so much as a nod farewell.

The door bangs shut behind him.
The trader sighs.
She misses proper haggling...

---

Torvane Argasdottir is halfway through her third beer
when she hears someone call her name.
She squints through the smoke in the belly of the alehouse
and waves at the two men approaching her.

"Hoy, Luftie," she bellows.
People sometimes think she has to speak loudly as part of a spell's price,
or that she is partly deaf.
Neither is true---she is just loud.
"Who's your friend?"

Luft slides onto the bench beside her.
"This is Chief Walker," he says,
jerking his chin at the impassive man standing opposite them.
There are only a handful of other Nukilik in the alehouse,
none of them apparently sober enough to stand.

Argasdottir pries Luft's hand off her arm.
"I can't drink when you do that," she says gently.
"Have a seat, Walker.
Karol!
Karol, get these men some beer!"

"No thank you," Walker says quietly,
seating himself on the bench as demurely as a eunuch monk.
He looks at the table,
at Torvane's glass
sidelong at the drinkers beside him,
everywhere but at Torvane and Luft's faces.

"No drink?
You're the first I've met here to say that."
Argasdottir takes the mug the aleman hands her,
then a second as Luft takes the first from her.
"So you're the one that goes trapping up into the Bentfathers, then?"

The Nukilik nods.
Argasdottir belches and wipes her mouth.
"Good, that's good.
Luft and I want to get out there and back before the harbor freezes.
That gives us, what, two weeks, maybe three?
Just straight up the river into the foothills, that's all."

"You will find better furs to the east,"
Walker comments neutrally after a moment.
He wears southern-style gloves rather than Nukilik mitts,
Argasdottir notices.
The sinew stitches along their seams are carefully knotted,
but unlike every other piece of clothing she has seen an Nukilik wear,
they have no embroidery or beads.

"We're not looking for furs,"
Luft says.

Argasdottir nudges his knee with hers under the table
and clears her throat.
"Ten crowns for the trip, half now and half when we're back.
Luft and I already have a sled and some elk.
We can get tack by day's end and leave tomorrow if you're interested."

The three are silent,
the two Garheimmen looking expectantly at the Nukilik,
who continues looking at the table.
Finally Luft snorts.
"Well if you're not,
do you know someone who would be?"
He drains his mug and lets it thump to the table.

Walker waits another dozen heartbeats
before raising his eyes to Argasdottir's.
"Tomorrow at the east gate," he agrees.

The Garheimmen woman smiles widely.
"Good, my new friend, good!"
She reachs across the table to squeeze the Nukilik's hand.
"At first light, then?"

Walker nods and stands.
As he lifts his pack to his shoulder
someone pushes him from behind and demands,
"What you do here?"

Walker turns his head.
A heavyset Nukilik wearing a parka decorated with the trading company's colors
stands unsteadily a few steps behind him.
"*Pauetsitgualuk*!
You go back the cold you belong.
Nobody want you here!"
He spits on the floor.

Someone whoops.
Someone else shouts, "Twenty crowns on the Goose!"
The aleman takes a cudgel from its resting place behind the bar
but says nothing.
People always drink more after a good fight,
or even after a bad one,
and nothing much in the alehouse is breakable except the patrons.

Walker shifts his pack on his shoulder and turns as if to go.
The larger Nukilik says something sneering and reaches for him.
Somehow Walker's hand is there to grab his sleeve.
He tugs,
turns,
brings one leg up between the other man's thighs as he bends his other knee,
and the one they call the Goose goes over him
and lands on the floor with a thud.

Argasdottir is on her feet.
"Are you all right?" she asks.

The Nukilik looks at her,
then at the Goose,
his lack of expression saying more loudly than words
that *he* is not the one lying on the floor.
"Tomorrow at the gate," he says.
"Dream well."
Someone who has just won twenty crowns claps him on the shoulder
as he walks to the door.

Torvane settles back on the bench
and looks sidelong at her partner.
"Knows how to handle himself," she observes.

The younger Garheimmen scowls.
"Won't be a problem."

She shrugs and focuses on her beer.
She used to find his endless need to prove himself amusing,
but lately---

The Goose rolls over,
gets his feet under him,
and launches himself at Walker,
a steel hunting knife in his hand.
Without thinking,
Torvane *reaches* across the room.
The air ripples.
For a moment everyone in the alehouse tastes ginger and regret.
The Nukilik trips over nothing and falls heavily to the floor once again.

The aleman hefts his cudgel and mutters a curse.
Others make signs with their fingers
or reach for charms tucked under the coats and sweaters.
Walker looks from the Goose to Torvane Argasdottir,
his face as expressionless as ever,
and walks out into the dim light of the arctic afternoon.

"What the hell did you do that for?" Luft demands.

"Sorry," Torvane sighs.
"I just---never mind."
She scrunches her toes inside her boot and winces
as the toenail that the spell cost her catches on the thick wool of her sock.
It will probably come off by morning.
She drains the last of her beer and stands,
conscious of all the people who aren't looking at her.
"Let's go get our gear together."

---

*"So the woman is a magician.
Good.
And the other?"*

*"I do not know, brother.
He is no bigger than I was at twelve summers."*

*"Do not underestimate him.
A knife does not have to be big to be deadly."
The night is a dark shell
flecked here and there with stars like chips of ice.
An elk bleats somewhere in the distance.
Another answers it.*

*"I am not afraid."
There is a moment's silence.
"But why must I go with them?
Laughs-at-Storms is sewing a new blanket.
She says it will be very soft."*

*"You must go with them because I have said you must."
The elk bleats again.
"You can put your arrows in Laugher's quiver next season."*

---

*Saknus and I spent four years together
learning how to wrestle.
We trapped small birds and fieldmice,
then used their bones to command their spirits to do small tricks
before setting them free.
One time I persuaded my brother to trap a lynx for us.
We called its spirit back again and again until my mother found out.
She beat me for it,
but his only punishment was a week without lessons.*

*At night Saknus told us stories of his home in the south,
of ships and kings and libraries
and cities with so many people
that no one knew all their names.
He laughed at his own mistakes as he learned our language,
but brushed off questions about his family or his past.*

*My grandfather sometimes grumbled that
there was no point teaching someone with no ancestors how to wrestle,
but my mother ignored him.
His presence added to our family's prestige---other shamans came to meet her strange pupil,
and from each of them I think Saknus learned a little more.*

*"A shaman must have help from strong spirits to work strong magic.
Our ancestors are angry when we call them back from the Summer Lands
and must be made to obey us.
Only in this way can magic be done."
Saknus smiled when my mother said this,
as though at some joke only he had heard.*

*"Can you only call your own ancestors back?" he asked.*

*"Yes," my mother replied,
and it was true.
I had tried to reach other shamans' ancestors through their necklaces-of-bones,
but I never could.*

*When my grandfather went to the Summer Lands we fasted for two days,
then cut off his thumbs and burned his body.
My mother emptied the stew-pot and boiled the thumbs
until the meat fell from them.*

*She took the bones and went away from camp.
"A spirit fights hardest the first time it is called back,"
I told Saknus,
proud of knowing something that for once he did not.
"Once he submits,
she will put his bones on her necklace."*

*"It already has a great many,"
he observed.

*"Twenty-two," I told him proudly.
"Every summer my mother makes a magic to tie her spirit to her own bones
so that after she dies I can call her back and wrestle her.
Every shaman does this for the sake of those who come after.
If a shaman sees many summers and does this many times
their grandchildren's grandchildren might still be able to call them."*

*The southerner turned his hands palms up in a gesture of thanks.
"I am grateful as always for your lessons."*

*My brother Walks-In-Storm scowled then,
as he often did when around the big-nosed southerner.
We were twins,
and he had taken to hunting as I had taken to the shaman's ways.
He said little when Saknus was near,
or left the tent if he could.
We had been close friends before Saknus came.
It hurt me how we grew apart in those years.*

---

"Damn his eyes, where is he?"
Luft stands and began pacing again.
"We only have a couple of hours of daylight
and the sealfucking elk are going to want to be fed soon.
Where in hell's our precious primping guide?"

"I don't think the elk fuck seals."
Torvane sits on the rear of the elksled,
wrapping and unwrapping the traces around her hands.
"He'll be here.
He said first light, so maybe he meant---"

"We should do this on our own."
Luft pack a snowball and throws it against the rickety palisade that rings the trading post,
then stoops to pick up more snow.
"I told you when we got here, we can do this ourselves.
Why in fuck's name do we need him?"
Another snowball smacks against the wall.

Argasdottir spots a dark blot approaching the gate.
"Here he is," she says,
struggling to her feet inside a double layer of furs
and wincing as her weight comes down on her bloodied toe.
"Hoy, Walker, good weather!"

The blot becomes the Nukilik's solid bulk.
Half a head shorter than the magician,
the hunter is wide across the shoulders and waist.
His face is the colour of bleached driftwood,
almost completely hidden in his parka's black hood.
A small pack on his back,
a pair of Garheimmen-style skis,
and two spears are the only gear he carries.

He nods when he reaches the southerners
and puts his skis onto the snow.
"The river ice is good from here to the mountains,"
the Nukilik says,
lashing his pack to the rear of the sled.

"We likely to bump into anyone else?"
Torvane asks as casually as she can.

Walker shakes his head.
"No one will be there.
They will all be east where there are furs.
Or sewing blankets,"
he adds with a trace of bitterness.

He moves forward to the sled traces.
The dogs grumble and snuffle his hands.
"I already checked those," Luft says sharply.
The Nukilik continues to tug and twist the leather straps,
making minute adjustments and tightening knots.
The young swordsman looks at Argasdottir angrily,
only to be shushed with a handwave.

The Nukilik makes a final slight adjustment in the length of a trace and straightens up,
patting one of the elk on his head.
"Maybe four, maybe five days to the mountains with these.
If the weather is good,"
he adds.

He straps on his skis as carefully as he tested the elks' traces,
picks up his spears,
reverses them,
and pushes off.
With a shout and a whipcrack Argasdottir follows in the sled.
Still cursing under his breath,
Luft follows behind,
a thick knit cap on his head
and his sword bumping against his leg.

The trading post disappears behind the first white hill
and is soon forgotten as the weary monotony of travel empties their minds.
The first snows of autumn smooth the tundra around them,
turning long gravel eskers into unmoving white waves
broken here and there by islands of rock too large to yet be covered.
A solitary speargull parallels their path
for a time before turning to continue its migration south.

By unspoken consent Walker stays out front,
his steady heave, heave, heave on his makeshift skipoles almost hypnotic.
Seated on the dogsled,
Argasdottir finally grunts and pulls a small flask from a pocket of her parka.
She draws the cork with her teeth and slurps the burning liquor.

"Walker!" she calls.
"Time to make camp!"
The horizon has swallowed the dull copper autumn sun.
They go another half-kilometer before Walker halts,
satisfied with the meager protection offered by a slight hollow.
He stands his skis and spears together in the snow
as Luft comes forward to the sled.

"Fuck a whale, I ache all over."
The younger Garheimmen stretches and yawns.
"Set up the tents, I'll look after the elk."
Argasdottir frowns,
but relaxes when Walker takes a small shovel from the sled
and begins thumping a patch of snow to flatten it.

As the Nukilik begins to erect their tent
Argasdottir plants five stakes in a circle around their camp.
She is tying a design on them in red cord
when she realizes that Walker has stopped work and is watching him.
"Anything wrong?"
she asks.

The Nukilik scowls.
"What is this?"

Argasdottir shrugs.
"A warding spell.
If anyone crosses it during the night,
it'll wake me up.
Just a precaution."

The Nukilik grunts and goes back to work.
Argasdottir watches him for a moment,
then shrugs and goes back to her spell.

---

*"Be at peace, brother.
She is not strong, or I would feel her now.
I do not even know if she can do what needs done."*

*"Then why must I go with them?"*

*"Because you swore an oath.
As your father my brother swore,
and as your grandmother my sister and her father my brother all swore."
My voice is a whisper.
I re-make the wizard's spell after Walker returns to the camp.
Somewhere in the distance a bear smells something it does not like
and growls unhappily.*

---

*In the summer of his fourth year,
Saknus destroyed us.
When the sun was so strong that it shone all night the Nukilik gathered
to trade and arrange marriages and welcome new shamans.
There was singing and dancing
and games of skill as young men and women tried to impress sceptical mothers and fathers.*

*My brother Walks-In-Storm easily beat the other young men in spear-throwing and running,
but I did not compete.
I was preparing to receive the scars of a shaman.
"I am sorry you have no ancestors to wrestle," I said to Saknus.*

*He smiled.
After four years among us,
he still showed his teeth when he did this.
"The stars are such as they have not been in many years, Holds-On-Too-Long," he said.
".Perhaps I will find another way."
And then he laughed and I laughed with him,
for what did the stars have to do with magic?*

*I went out the next morning across the tundra
with my mother and two other shamans.
Things were done and words were spoken,
and I returned that evening with three crusted wounds on each cheek
and a tooth from my grandmother's father on a thong around my neck.
The part of him still bound to it
had faded so much that my mother would have cracked it and burned the pieces
if I had not needed a spirit to practice with.*

*We came back to find people gathered around the field in the center of the camp.
"The stranger is going to show us a new game,"
my brother said,
scowling.*

*Saknus had drawn a great, complicated pattern on the field with sand,
a star with five points enclosed in a circle.
Strange symbols filled the star,
and torch stakes stood at each of its points.
He waved to us and smiled,
then raised his arm into the air.*

*Suddenly his hand was covered with flame.
People oohed and aahed around us
as Saknus lit each of the torches in turn.
"How does he do this?"
Walks-In-Storm demanded.
"You said he could not wrestle!"*

*My mother shook her head.
"He is not wrestling," she said.
"I do not know what he is doing."*

*When all the torches were lit
the fire on Saknus's hand flickered out.
He smiled happily and let hell loose upon us.*

*My uncle was standing beside me.
He screamed and fell to the ground,
clawing at his throat.
I saw a dim form sitting astride him,
strangling him with four hands
while smoke poured from its eyes.
"He's killing us!" my brother shouted as other shamans doubled over or simply collapsed,
their backs broken.*

*Walks-In-Storm threw his spear.
It flew straight,
but faltered and fell to the earth outside Saknus's circle.*

*People ran from the field.
I did not.
Sworn only that day,
I was still a shaman.
I called the one ancestor I had,
as the other shamans called those whose bones they carried,
but none could batter through the wall Saknus had created.
Finally the other shamans and many others of our people
lay dead on the field.*

*I stood there with tears on my face,
unable even to curse Saknus in my rage.
He opened his eyes and smiled.*

*"Holds-On-Too-Long," he said approvingly,
ignoring the spears, rocks, and corpses that lay around his magic circle.
"Good. Very good. You are going to help me now."*

*Spirit hands closed around my throat.*

---

Their fourth day on the frozen river,
Walker finds tracks.
He is in front,
as he has been since they departed,
moving at a steady tempo.
Suddenly he swerves and stops.

Torvane reins in the elk and puts her flask back in her pocket.
"Hoy, what's the problem?" she asks,
clambering unsteadily off the sled.

The Nukilik pulls his feet from his skis and bends nearly double,
intent on the snow beneath him.
Above them the sky is clear, bright, and bitterly cold.

"What wrong?" Luft asks,
his hand on the hilt of his sword.

Argasdottir shakes her head.
"I don't know, lad. Walker?"
The elk have dropped onto the snow,
taking the opportunity to rest.
One snarks as another snaps at its cropped tail.

The Nukilik walks slowly back and forth before straightening up.
"*Matsheshu*," he says grimly,
scanning the horizon.
"Bandits.
On foot, maybe a hand, maybe more, two days ago.
Going north."

There is a moment's silence,
then Luft spits.
"You said nobody was going to be around," he says accusingly.
"Bloody fucking useless guide you've turned out to be."

"Luft! Be quiet."
The magician takes a deep breath.
"Do you think they're close?"

The Nukilik shakes his head.
"Two days ago.
There is nothing for them here.
They will be gone."

Another moment of silence,
and then Luft spits again.
"Marvelous.
Bloody fucking marvelous.
First nobody's here, and now they're two days gone.
I suppose we'll be cooking for them tonight, eh?"
He sounds as though it would be a personal triumph.

"They are two days gone."
For the first time Argasdottir hears anger in the Nukilik's voice.
"You will not cook them supper tonight, little man."
He starts to walk back to his skis.

"Fucking sealfucker!"
Luft knocks Argasdottir's arm out of his way and strides through the snow.

Walker appears to ignore him.
"It is not wise to rest the elks without feeding them,"
he tells Torvane calmly.

Luft swings roundhouse at the Nukilik.
Walker brings his spear up out of the snow
and blocks the punch easily,
twisting the spear and clubbing Luft in the head.
The small man goes to one knee and draws his sword as he rises.
His knit cap lies in the snow,
revealing a leather and steel helmet on his head.
He bellows and charges.
The Nukilik reverses his spear and braces himself.

A sudden flash blinds them both.
Someone howls at the magic glare,
but Argasdottir cannot tell if it is her partner or their guide.
The elk began barking furiously.

When Luft's vision clears he is sitting in the snow,
his sword still in his hand,
his head aching.
Torvane is quieting the elk.
Walker stands a few meters away with his hands still over his eyes.

Argasdottir looks up.
"Serves you right," she says curtly.
"Walker! Are your eyes all right?"

The Nukilik lowers his hands and nods.
There are tears on his cheeks.
He looks at Argasdottir for a long instant,
then stoops to pick up his spear.
"We have lost time," he says.
He walks back to his skis and straps them on.

"Luft, all right?"
Torvane helps her partner to his feet.

Luft shakes her off and spits in the snow.
"We can do this ourselves,"
he hisses.
"Get rid of him now.
We're going to have to do it anyway."

"Shut up, pig-eyes!"
The magician glanced at Walker,
then clutches Luft's sleeve and pulls him close.
"We need him.
Just think about all that gold and stay out of his fucking way.
Now get your skis back on.
The sooner we're through this,
the better for both of us."

Minutes later the trio is moving north again.
The magician busies herself with her own dark thoughts.
Luft curses Walker in dull counterpoint to the steady rhythm of their movement.
The Nukilik pretends not to hear.

---

The mountains were no older than the rest of the world, but they seemed
stooped beneath ice and snow. The sun was a dull glow in the southeast
when Walker told the others that it was time to leave the sled.

"Today, walking, will bring us to your place," the Nukilik said as Luft
and Argasdottir sorted through their gear. "Do not leave food for the dogs.
They would fight for it."

Luft said something under his breath, then straightened and shouldered
his own small pack. "I'm ready when you are, Vald. Let's get up there."

Argasdottir stuffed some more vials and pouches into his parka, then tied
the bindings. "I hope that will do. Ready, Walker? Right, then, and
off." With Walker leading, Luft behind him, the three began walking. I
waited until the men were a hand of hundreds of paces gone, then cut the
dogs's tethers. They yelped or snarled, according to temperament, then
fled bristly-tailed.

There was no path as such, but a narrow ledge wound up the mountain, in
places wide enough for a camp, in places vanishing completely, so that
the men had to inch sideways along the rock, hands and feet in the snow.
On either side of them grey stone rose or fell steeply.

Walker climbed steadily, pausing occasionally to let the others catch
up. Luft moved with dogged determination, never looking directly at the
Nukilik. Behind them Argasdottir struggled, breathing great irregular clouds
of steam. Neither Garheimmen noticed the darkening sky until the first
flakes of snow began to fall.

"Bloody frozen hell," Luft cursed at one spot when Argasdottir dropped his
weight onto a convenient bulge of the mountain and gulped air. "Would
have been better if I'd stayed in Karlslod Castle waiting trial, maybe,
instead of following you and that damned old map of yours."

The wizard shook his head. "Better cold, than dead," he heaved. "Almost
there. Come on, Luftie, the cave should be, just a little further on,
give us a place to rest." He struggled to his feet. Almost pleading, he
added, "Just a few more hours."

By afternoon later the storm had become so thick that they could see
only arm's-lengths in any direction. Walker was a dozen steps ahead of
the others, testing the snow with the butt of his spear. Luft was
reaching back to help the wizard up a steep section of the path when war
cries split the air.

"Ware yourself, Vald!" Luft shouted, spinning and pulling his sword free
as a parka-clad man dropped to the path ahead of him. The Garheimmen
fell to one knee under a spear thrust. As his attacker pulled it back
for another try Luft cut viciously at the haft, rising and chopping at
the hands holding it. Another man dropped to the path behind the first.

"Yeaaaaaaah!" Luft knocked aside his opponent's spear and slammed into
him, pushing him back into the second man. All three went down in a
heap. Luft rolled to the side, almost sliding off the path, and cut
backhand. He felt his sword hit flesh, and pulled it free as he
scrambled back to his feet. A single body lay on the pathway, bleeding
from a deep gouge in its face, quickly dying. Scuffed snow showed where
the second man had slid down the mountainside into the storm.

"Luft! It's me, Luftie, it's me." The wizard had his gloves off and was
anxiously scanning the mountain slope beside them. "They must've climbed
up to that ledge, there, and been waiting for us."

The berserker rage was ebbing out of the smaller man. Redfaced, he
shouted, "Where's your bleeding almighty favourite raping Tir-damned
traitor guide, I want to know!" Droplets of blood scribed a delicate arc
in the snow as he waved his sword. "They were waiting for us, well, were
they now? One guess who let them know we were coming!" He spat and
kicked the corpse.

"Walker!" Argasdottir shouted, then waited. "Walker, are you there?"

Silence.

Luft laughed hysterically. "Did I tell you! Led us right into a trap,
your bloody little flat-faced friend. Tir's plums, shut up, Vald!" the
small man shouted as Argasdottir filled his lungs to call again. "He's
gone, isn't he? And good riddance, I say."

Argasdottir slumped a little and sighed, staring at the dead man as the
falling snow made a shroud. "We need Walker, Luftie." His voice was
almost pleading.

"Why?" Berendsson demanded. "What in hell can he do that I can't?"

Argasdottir looked up. "Nothing," he finally said. "Come on, we're almost
there." The younger man wiped his blade on the corpse, but did not
sheath it. The two men started walking. Around them my storm thickened.

---

Walker had worried when the snow started to fall; there had been no sign
that morning of bad weather approaching. He was almost relieved when he
heard war-cries behind and in front of him. A bandit dropped to the path
in front of him and feinted a high lunge. As Walker parried a second
body landed on his back, carrying him off the path.

He fought like a lynx as they slid, ignoring the rocks that slammed into
him. The Foxtail punched at him. Walker snarled and pulled for the knife
at his belt, his spear lost somewhere in the snow. The bandit clutched
Walker's arm with one hand and tried to punch him again with the other.

The pair slid over an edge and dropped into a drift of snow. Walker
rolled to his feet like a wolf and drew his knife.

"Stop, my brother!" I whispered. He froze with his knife poised to
strike. What-Colour-Wind slid to a stop on the slope above the small
cleft in which we were hidden, then jumped down beside me.
"Where-Goes-Crow is dead," he said. "The little one killed him."

Walker's face was rigid with rage. "You have betrayed me," he said
tightly. "I unsay my oath. You are no more my brother."

I would have sighed. Behind me stood a half-dozen Foxtails, all but one
with a spear or bow aimed at my great-grandnephew. "You are with
friends, my brother," I told him.

"Liar!" he spat, and leapt at me. To the others, it would have been
lightning-quick. I had time to decide once again not to kill him, catch
his arm, and throw him to the ground.

I said despairingly as he glared at me, "And I swore I would make you a
great chief. How-Far-Thrown! Are they there yet?"

The shaman (weak, but so were they all now, with so few spirits to call)
closed his eyes and fondled his mother's thigh gingerly. "Someone says
no," he said, careful not to name her as they wrestled. "They are still
climbing. The angry one hopes to fight. The wrestler---"

"He is not a wrestler," I interrupted. "What he does is different, and
better. Rest." The old man relaxed, sweat-steam smoking off his face.

Things were going to be complicated. I had wanted the wizard to reach
the cave alone; I had not thought the little one good enough to kill one
of my bandit gaurds.

"What-Colour-Wind! Give me your parka." Silently the Foxtail hunter
disrobed, shivering. Even for us, it was a cold day. I reversed the
parka so that the inner white fur made me almost invisible in the snow
and put the disguise on clumsily, unused to its constriction after so
long. "I will go now," I announced. "Walks-With-The-Dead, you will stay
here."

"I hate you," he said, and meant it. "My great-grandfather should have
killed you."

I would have laughed. I stuffed the mittens into the tops of the boots
and started to claw my way up the snow-covered rock.

*I awoke lying on cold stone,
bound hand and foot.
Above me the cave roof was a perfect dome.
Beneath me the floor was as smooth as polished ice.
Light from a glowing ball suspended mid-air showed Heraldsson on his knees,
carefully painting the floor.*

*"Three thousand years, chancellor!"
he muttered to himself.
"Three thousands years since there have been such stars.
How can we in good conscience not use them?"
He examined what he had just painted,
then licked his thumb and wiped at it.*

*"Monster," I whispered.
My throat was so dry that only a croak came out.*

*"Yes, I know it's forbidden," he continued.
"And for good reason, I'm sure.
But think of what we could do---we could stand with the Pilots themselves!"

*"Monster," I said again.
This time my voice was louder.
"This place is sacred."*

*He looked up and smiled.
"Oh, good, you're awake.
How is your head?"*

*"You will never know warmth or rest," I spat.
"The ghosts of our shamans will drag you down to hell."*

*"Oh, I don't think so."
He gestured behind him.
"I have all the necklaces-of-bones I could find over there."
He smiled again.
"Real magic can do a lot that your people don't know about, Holds-On-Too-Long.
Between what your mother taught me and what I already knew,
reaching and using all your ghosts isn't going to be hard."*

*"But why?" I had not wanted to ask, or to weep.*

"It's a good question," he said approvingly.
"I'm going to try to trap a demon like the ones I used at your camp,
only much, much larger.
I need a lot of power to wrestle it,
so..."
He shrugged.*

*"Traitor. You will be damned for this."*

*He sighed.
"Actually, if this works, I'll be the one doing the damning.".*

*It took him two days to finish his pattern.
He gave me water when he remembered, but no food.
By the time he was done I was light-headed and could not stop shivering.*

*He laid me out on the stone slab in the center of the cave
and stripped off my parka and boots.
*"Now, you may be wondering what your role is to be in our little play,"
Saknus said in the same voice my mother used with children when setting a broken bone.
"Well, I need a treat to offer my demon as bait.
And you, my friend, are going to be that for me."*

*He painted a pattern on my forehead,
then spoke words never meant for a human throat.
I suddenly felt heavier than iron,
as I had when I had sworn the shaman's oath only a few days before.
This time, though, the sensation did not fade.*

*He nodded and put the two boxes containing the necklaces-of-bones beside me.
*"That spell is to prevent your spirit from running away," he explained
as he gave each portion of the painted pattern one last check.
"It will bring more and more of himself into this world
to get at you through that pattern.
And when it's all here,
I will command your shamans to reach out through the circle and---"*

*He cut himself off at my howl,
looking truly startled.
"Fine," he muttered.
"Be that way."
And then he drew a knife from his belt and cut open my throat.*

*Hot blood ran down past my ears.
Saknus stepped back,
stooped to sketch an arc that completed the design on the floor,
and began to chant.*

*My sight began to fade.
I heard his voice, louder and louder,
and felt a cold wind blowing from nowhere
carrying a stench like all the rot the world had ever made.*

*And there were voices---Nukilik voices,
my grandfather's and others that I did not know,
chanting with Saknus, louder and louder,
building towards a climax.
I suddenly knew that something was coming closer,
something infinitely worse than the shadows that I had seen in the camp.*

*Saknus and I screamed at the same instant.
My vision snapped back to normal.
I turned my head with immense effort to see him lying dead beside the pattern
with a spear through his back.
Walks-In-Storm was standing at the entrance to the cave, calling my name.*

*Somehow I stood,
though my limbs felt like they were made of stone.
I stepped over Saknus's body,
and the air crackled around me as I left the pattern.*

*"Come!" my brother shouted.
I took a few steps,
leaning like a cripple on his arm,
then stopped.*

*"The necklaces," I said. "We must get the necklaces."*

*I turned and stumbled back
but when I tried to step into the pattern,
I could not.
I told Walks-In-Storm to try, but he could not either.
As my heart finally stopped beating,
I managed one last time to weep.*

The path became steeper as it took them a quarter-turn around the
mountain. I climbed straight up the mountainside, using handholds when
they were convenient. They had to reach the cave before me, but not by
too much.

My storm was raging by the time the two Garheimmen found the cave mouth.
For a few moments I was afraid they had walked past it, blinded by snow
and fatigue, but the small one, Luft, shouted and pointed. They squeezed
through the narrow entrance. I counted to a hundred in Garheimmen, then
followed.

They had left their packs and food at the entrance. I wished briefly for
a sense of smell so that I could tell if they had torches, but it would
not matter. I donned What-Colour-Wind's mittens, then pulled the hood of
the parka forward to hide my features. I moved quietly on the path I had
taken a hundred times in as many years.

Finally I came to the small widening in the passage where the floor
levelled. It was dimly lit now by reflections from the main chamber
ahead. I crept forward.

Above them the cave roof was as smooth and as round as a clear sky. The
fighter held a torch as the wizard surveyed the chamber. In its center,
though I could not see it now, an elaborate design was painted in faded
colors on the floor. Beside it was a man, his long-dead body mummified
by the cold, a spear protruding awkwardly from his back. Lying inside
the pattern was a slab of stone large enough for a man to lie upon,
stained and discoloured, and two wooden boxes.

Finally Argasdottir nodded. "That's Heraldsson, for certain. I guess he
annoyed the flat-faces a bit much."

"Can you get through it?" Luft asked.

"I think so." The wizard pulled something from a pouch, then knelt and
began to draw.

I edged forward a bit more, then stopped, unable to get close enough to
see what he was doing without exposing myself. I would have cursed, but
he might have felt that.

Finally Argasdottir stood. "Give me your torch," he said. Luft handed it to
him. "And your sword." At Luft's quizzical look the wizard added, "It's
steel," as if that were an explanation. "Now, kneel there. No, more to
the left." Putting the sword down, Argasdottir finished drawing his design
around his partner, then propped the torch against the wall.

"Now, keep your eyes on those boxes. When they start to glow, you get in
there and grab them. Heraldsson's treasure must be in them."

"When they glow. Right, let's be done." Luft sounded eager; Argasdottir
shook his head.

He began to chant in a language I did not know. I felt power gently
stirring at his command. Luft crouched, staring across the old pentacle.
Argasdottir's voice grew louder, more commanding. Suddenly he shouted three
words, then again, and again, and reached down and grabbed the sword and
swung it over his head and down into Luft Berendsson's neck.

There was a sudden surge of power as the pentacle broke. The torch
flickered and died, and the only sound was the wizard's sobbing. I felt
relieved, and almost angry. I had been studying stolen texts for a
century, tryng to find a way to break into the pentacle; none had even
suggested such a thing as sacrificing a man.

The torch flickered alight, then steadied. With the sword still in his
hand Argasdottir stumbled across the floor.

"There's no gold," I whispered. He shrieked and spun around.

"Who's there?" He looked abut wildly. "Name yourself!"

I stepped into the light, keeping my head bowed. "There is no gold," I
repeated. "There never was."

"Who are you?" He looked older now, grey-haired and shaking.

"Holder. Holds-On-Too-Long. Walker's brother, and greatgranduncle." I
took another step toward him.

"But my map---" he began.

"I made that, and let it go south. I needed someone who could break that
spell." Another step.

He turned and ran to the boxes. He knocked the lid off the first with
the sword and stared at its contents. I was halfway across the floor.

He stood slowly. "No gold?" he whispered. "Nothing?" There were tears on
his cheeks. "You mean I---"

"Nothing," I replied. "Nothing but bones."

He choked, then shouted "You bastard!" and threw fire at me. I parried
it easily with the Garheimmen magic I had learned. As I began a spell of
my own he lifted the sword and charged.

I feinted to the left, then stepped back and leaned into his lunge. The
sword slid easily through the parka, through my chest, and out my back.
Argasdottir screamed in terror as the hood fell back from my rotted
features.

"Too late," he heard me whisper as my fleshless hands wrung his neck.

---

*We died all winter the year Heraldsson took our magic from us. No-one
could call the seals to the hunt, so the people starved. No-one could
heal the sick and injured, so the old died from broken legs and the
young from colds.*

*And no-one could break Heraldsson's magic so that I could die.*

*In the spring the first ship of Garheimmen arrived, carrying soldiers
and wizards searching for the traitor. We fought them, and slew many. I
stole books and learned spells to hide the pentacle in the mountain from
sorcerous eyes. It was not enough; the Garheimmen had seen furs, and
gold pebbles in the rivers. They came back in strength, bringing the
coughing sickness and the bleeding sickness and whisky.*

*So I swore an oath with my brother, and learned patience, and drew maps.*

---

How-Far-Thrown made a sign, clutching his mother's thighbone when I cam
back down the mountain, the necklaces-of-bones around my mummified neck,
the wind whistling between my ribs where flesh had rotted away before I
had learned to stay in the cold. Walks-WithThe-Dead had a new bruise on
his cheek, and limped; one of the Foxtails had an arm splinted.

"I have won," I told them needlessly. "We have our magic back. Walker!
You are going to be a chief now. You are going to be the greatest chief
the People have ever known."

He spat roward me. "You betrayed me," he said. "I take back my oath. We
are no more brothers."

I would have laughed. "When you great-grandfather first saw my throat
open to the wind, he said the same," I told him. "But I made him chief
over all the People. I made his son a great Chief, and his son your
father, and now I will make you the greatest of Chiefs, brother. You
will lead the people to war against the bignoses. You will push them
back into the sea, them and their disease and their drinking."

"I will not do this for you," he shouted.

I wore all the magic my people had had around my neck. For a moment I
let him see them, their ghosts standing around me, bound to their bones
for a time as Heraldsson's spell had bound me forever to mine, unable to
leave this world, unable to find the final peace that I deserved.

"You will," I promised him, whispering. "They will call you Chief, and
bring you gifts. And they will learn to call me King." A cold wind blew
through me. Somewhere a wolf howled. Around us, the snow fell.

"Oh Noxy, brush your hair!" Indy set her tea down on the table and began to
stand.

"I can do it," Noxy protested. She dragged the brush she and her mother shared
through her hair another few times. "Is that better?"

Her mother sighed, just as her own mother once had. "Yes, I suppose.  Honestly,
someone would think you'd been possessed by lightning.  Let's get going."

Noxy gestured at the sergeant's sword, which still lay in its scabbard on the
kitchen table.  "Are you going to give that back to him?"

"Not today," Indy replied.

They walked through the village together, squinting against the sharp-edged
morning sun.  The air smelled of damp air, pine smoke, and frying eggs.  People
sat on stools outside their houses in twos and threes wearing thick sweaters
above sturdy trousers and sturdier boots.  The men knit or peeled potatoes while
the women picked spiderwebs apart and wound the strands onto spools.

Indy had to stop to answer the same questions every few dozen strides.  How were
the soldiers getting on? What did they think of the village?  And what was the
*tralpa* going to do?  "We're on our way to ask," she replied over and over
again, carefully ignoring comments about how shameful the Scholar-Candidate's
behavior had been the night before, but not half so shameful as the sergeant's.
Drawing a sword in a funeral procession---well, they *had* been his men, but
still...

Many of the village's elders didn't bother to hide their unhappiness about their
guests, but the sourest face was Aft's.  Standing next to an armload of saplings
that had spent the winter drying in his rafters, he looked up from mending the
fence around one of the village's carrot gardens just long enough to ask, "So?
Did the tiger eat anyone last night?" before going back to his hammering.

Sergeant Dorbu was sitting on the guesthouse steps in front of a half-circle of
children when mother and daughter reached the square.  Sensy and Rash looked up,
and Sensy raised her hand in a half-wave.

"And this is called a greave," the sergeant said, pointing at the armored front
of his boot.  "It's to protect me from vampire mice.  See?" He tapped it with
his fingernail, *clunk*.  "They could bite that if they wanted, but all they'd
do is blunt their teeth."

"What about squirrels?" asked one of the younger children.

"Ah, good question.  If there was just one of them, I'd---oh, hello, honored."
The sergeant stood and brushed his hands on his kilt.  "Thank you again for
letting us see to our men last night.  I apologize for my behavior."

"Thank you, sergeant," said Indy.  "I trust your men are on the mend?"

"Yes, thank you," said the sergeant.  "Although I..." He blinked, then sniffed,
then started to say, "Excuse me," but the sneeze came first.  *Hwah!* One of the
children giggled, then clapped her hand over her mouth.  The sergeant blinked
and sniffed again.  "Sorry---too many nights out in the open."

"Visitors from down below often catch colds in our thin air," Indy said
sympathetically.  "I hope it passes quickly."

The guesthouse door opened behind the sergeant.  The children shuffled back
wide-eyed as the tiger padded out into the sunlight.  He wasn't as big as he'd
been in Noxy's troubled dreams during the night, but she still had to stop
herself from reaching for her mother's hand.

Almost unnoticed, Private Thokmay slipped out behind him and closed the door.
Instead of his armor, he wore a plain brown rain cape over his kilt and boots.
He kept his eyes downcast as the tiger said, "Good morning, honored."

"Good morning," Indy replied.  "Did you sleep well?"

"I did, honored, thank you." The tiger seemed not to notice that thirty pairs of
eyes were staring at him.  *He must be used to it,* Noxy thought.

Indy turned back to the sergeant. "My daughter has asked if you could spare your
boy for an hour so that she could show him our village while the other children
do their chores."  Noxy heard Rash mutter under his breath at that.  "If he
would like to---oh dear." She stopped mid-sentence as the sergeant took a deep
breath and scrunched up his face.

"Nope," he whooshed a moment later, blinking.  "That one's not ripe yet."

"You'd be better in by the fire than tramping around the countryside, sergeant,"
Kulbinder rumbled.

"I agree," said Indy firmly.  "My mother will make you some lemon ginger tea.
That will set you right in no time."

"Thang you," the sergeant said stuffily.

"I will explore the forest," the tiger declared.  With no more ceremony than
that, he stretched and padded off toward the main gate.

Indy clapped her hands.  "Right.  Everyone else, let's not waste the day."  As
the children groaned and got to their feet, Private Thokmay dipped his head to
Noxy.  "By your lead, honored?"

Noxy and the tiger's boy walked side by side in silence for a few steps while
Noxy tried to think of something to say.  "That's the South Tower," Noxy she
finally offered, pointing at six rectangular stories of stone.  "It still has a
roof, but the stairs inside fell down a long time ago.  You used to be able to
get up there by climbing a tree, but they cut it down after Grappa Gas fell out
of it for the second time.  That was before I was born.  And that one's the
Round Tower, and the short one over there is called the Quick Tower, because
it's quickest to get up."

"They're very impressive," said Thokmay.  "The walls around Gandan-in-Gandan are
higher, but they're human-made---you can see the joints between the blocks."

"That's nice," Noxy replied, instantly regretting how inane she sounded.  "Oh,
and that's Granna Fee's house, with the green door.  She's my grandmother.  And
she teaches school.  And that's Grappa Gas's house, the one with the yellow and
blue door.  He used to be reeve before my mother.  And that's, um, well, they're
all just different people's houses."

Noxy fell silent.  Thokmay had a polite but absent look on his face, just like
the one Indy got when Grappa Gas started talking about how things had been in
his day.  *It's probably not much compared to a city,* she thought glumly.
Two-story houses with steep shingled roofs, little vegetable gardens nestled
between logs laid parallel a stride apart, and all around, sharp mountain peaks
looming over walls older than humanity...  She wouldn't have believed how
strange it all seemed to the young lowlander beside her.

They walked in silence along the path that ran beside the wall.  Ancient
cobblestones showed through the hard-packed dirt in a few places.  Noxy scuffed
crusts of frost off a few absentmindedly, wondering what else she could say.

"What is that?" Thokmay asked.  A heavy wooden grill lay across a shoulder-high
opening in the wall ahead of them.  Behind it, time-worn stone steps led down
into the mountain.

"That's just the old tunnels," said Noxy.  "We're not supposed to go in."

Thokmay frowned.  "Does Sergeant Dorbu know about them?"

"I don't know," Noxy said.  "Most of them are flooded.  Except for the one under
Grappa Gas's house, and the ones by the drying sheds.  We use them for cellars."

"I'll tell him.  Soldiers should know as much as they can about their
surroundings," Thokmay said, as if repeating a lesson.

Noxy shrugged.  "I suppose.  Come on, we can see more from up top."

The steps lay flush against the side of the wall.  They had been built for
Pilots, not human beings, so each step was as high as Noxy's knee and took her
two strides to cross.  Even after hundreds of years, the stones fit together so
snugly that it was hard to tell where one ended and the next began.  She was
breathing hard by the top, and Thokmay was panting in the thin mountain air.

The top of the wall was wide enough for three people to walk side by side.
Parapets along its outer edges were interrupted here and there by slits, each
one a slightly different shape for reasons known only to their makers.  "Makes
Your Breath Rancid is that way," Noxy said, pointing through one of them.  "You
can't see the village itself because the valley bends, but we come up here
sometimes when they're clouds are out to watch them."

"Why do you call your villages things like that?" the young soldier asked.  "And
yourselves?"

Noxy smiled.  "They're dragon names.  They're supposed to make us sound
unappetizing, so that when the dragons finally fly, they won't want to eat us."

Thokmay snorted.  "Well, where does *your* name come from??" Noxy bristled.

"From the army orphanage," he replied, his expression instantly neutral once
again.  "My full name is Gandan's Nineteenth Thokmay."

Noxy opened her mouth, then closed it.  "Sorry," she said, not knowing what else
to say.

As she was trying to think of something, Thokmay pointed through one of the
parapet slits at the gorge below them.  "Are those the clouds we were on?"

Noxy glanced through the neighboring slit.  "Yup.  The bull is Big Blue, and the
cow is Pillow.  We've had them practically forever."

The two old clouds were hardly moving, but Noxy could have watched them for
hours.  She loved the way they slowly changed shape as they drifted about, and
how soft they felt when she stroked them.  Being up in the sky on a cloud was
like riding on a grownup's shoulders when you were little, only a thousand times
better.  You could see everything---deer grazing beneath the twisted pines,
mountain goofs standing on rocky ledges no wider than the heel of your boot,
broad-winged condors making slow circles as they waited for a rabbit to forget
to look up...  When the air was still, and the cloud was just drifting, it felt
like the whole world was a story that was about to be told for the very first
time.

Thokmay wrinkled his nose.  "They smelled like wet goofs."

"They just hadn't rained for a while," Noxy explained defensively.  "Someone
will probably take them out today and let them refill the fishpond." A thought
struck her---maybe this tour didn't have to be a complete waste of time.  "Here,
come with me."

Descending the stairs was no easier on her knees than climbing them.  Rather
than going directly to the gate, she led Thokmay on a roundabout path through
back lanes and around vegetable gardens that just happened to avoid anywhere her
mother was likely to be.

A steep path reinforced with half-cut logs wound down to the wooden platform
that stuck out over the cloud pen.  Big Blue and Pillow were both floating fifty
strides away in the middle of the gorge.

"Can you call them over?" Thokmay asked.

"I can whistle for them," Noxy said.  "But you have to be touching them to
mind-speak to them."

Thokmay wrinkled his nose.  "I still think they smell like wet goofs."

*Twinge.* "Ouch," Noxy muttered, putting her hand on the back of her head.  The
pain was strong enough this time that she thought there would be a lump, but she
couldn't feel anything.

"Is everything all right?" Thokmay asked.

"It's fine," she snapped.  She'd hoped the clouds would be right next to the
platform so that he could stroke one.  She could whistle---she'd been practicing
all winter---but if anyone heard, she'd have questions to answer.  Like
generations of cloudherds before her, she wished she could mind-talk to clouds
from a distance.

"Um...  Are they supposed to be doing that?"  She opened her eyes at Thokmay's
words to see Big Blue turning toward them with Pillow in his wake.

Thokmay stepped back instinctively as Big Blue bumped against the platform.
Noxy stroked the bull cloud's flank fondly.  "See?" she said.  "You can pull
bits of them this way and that, but it all settles back."  She grabbed a handful
of Big Blue's side and demonstrated.

The young soldier patted the cloud gingerly.  Noxy grinned.  "Here, do this."
She backed up, then ran at the cloud and threw herself onto his back.  *Poof!*
"Come on!  He won't bite."

"Noxious Aftertaste!  What do you think you're doing?"  Noxy's heart leaped into
her throat.  There, at the top of the steps that led down to the platform, stood
her mother and Sergeant Dorbu.  "You get off that cloud *right now*, young
lady!"

Noxy's stomach was a sick knot by the time they reached the fortress gate.  Her
mother hadn't said a word to her on the walk back.  "Thank you for the tour,"
Thokmay said politely, dipping his head politely.

"You're welcome," Noxy mumbled.

"And thank you as well," Sergeant Dorbu told Indy, smiling.  "It was a
pleasure."

"You're welcome," the mayor said.  If she had been anyone else, Noxy would have
said she was blushing slightly.

As the sergeant and Private Thokmay fell into step beside one another, Indy
rounded on her daughter.  "Tell me," she said coldly, "What exactly would you
have done if he'd slipped off the cloud?"

"He wouldn't have slipped off!" Noxy protested.  "It was Big Blue---he's as safe
as---"

"I don't care if it was Big Blue or the mattress on your bed!" Indy said
angrily.  "Those men just settled half a dozen of their friends.  What do you
think they'd say if we had to tell them they had to settle one more just because
you wanted to show off?"

"I wasn't showing off!" Noxy protested.

"Well you sure as saints weren't being sensible!"  Indy's jaw set.  "Granna Burn
gave us some thimbleberries.  I want you to get the seeds out so that I can make
a pie for dinner."

"Thimbleberries?" Noxy said in despair.  "That'll take forever!  I was going
to---"

"It doesn't matter what you were 'going to'."  Indy took Noxy by the shoulders,
wondering yet again when her daughter had grown so tall.  "Sweetling, listen to
me.  *Really* listen to me." She combed her daughter's hair off her forehead
with her fingers.  "Half the village is already muttering about it being time
for a new reeve.  How can I ask them to behave when my own daughter won't?  Now,
go get washed up and start on those thimbleberries."

Noxy nodded glumly.  "Yes, *amma*."

She moped home to collect the bucket full of hard red berries and a large bowl,
then climbed the steps to the top of the Quick Tower.  She and Rash and Sensy
had covered a tumbled-down block of stone with a bit of gray canvas to make a
pretend cloud the summer before.  Plopping herself down on it, she started
squeezing bitter grain-sized seeds out of the berries.  Why did she have to be
the one to show him around?  Why couldn't the stupid soldiers have washed up
somewhere else?  And why did the sun have to be so...so sunny?

When she heard the first shouts from the main square she ignored them, thinking
that it was just children playing jump-sticks or *kabbadi*.  Then she heard
Sergeant Dorbu shout, "Hah! Heeeyah!" She tossed another berry into the bowl and
stood up to look.

She was just in time to see Thokmay duck under the sergeant's out-thrust stick
of wood and lunge with his own, shouting "Hah!" in turn.  Every child in the
village was gathered around watching, and not a few of the grownups as well.

The sergeant knocked Thokmay's stick away and spun around, slashing left and
right, one, two, three, as if he was fighting an invisible opponent.  While his
back was turned the young soldier stepped forward and stabbed the sergeant in
the ribs.

The sergeant groaned, pinning Thokmay's stick with his arm so that it came out
of the boy's grip as Dorbu turned.  Thokmay only had time to take one step back
before the sergeant poked him in the chest.  To Noxy's disgust, the children
started to clap.

"You must keep your grip even after you strike," Kulbinder grumbled from the
sidelines.  "No point giving your man one last blow."

"Yes, honored," said Thokmay, panting slightly.

Sergeant Dorbu handed Thokmay's stick back to him.  Raising them together, they
started duelling again.  Thokmay lost quickly this time, but won the third round
when the sergeant pretended to stumble over a loose cobblestone.  While the
children clapped and cheered, some of the older villagers shook their heads and
swapped disapproving looks.  Still, they kept watching.

By the time the two soldiers stopped, they were both soaked with sweat.  "You're
getting better every day," Sergeant Dorbu said.  "But we could both use a
sauna."

Thokmay nodded, breathing hard.  "Yes, honored.  Smells like we could both use
one too."  For the first time, Noxy saw him smile.

"Show me, show me!" shouted Little Gas.  He clapped his hands with excitement.
"I want to!"

Thokmay's smile froze.  He glanced at the sergeant, who shook his head almost
imperceptibly.  "I'm glad you liked it," the young soldier said.  "But it's not
really a game."

He squatted so that his eyes were level with the eight-year-old boy's.  "But I
can show you something else if you like," he said.  He looked left and right as
if to make sure no spies or grownups were listening.  "Do you have any spare
socks at home?" he asked.  Little Gas nodded.  "Good.  You go and get me three
pairs of socks, quick as you can, and three stones the size of your thumb."

Little Gas bit his lip.  "I only have just one other pair of socks," he said.
"They're for when it's winter, so my feet will fit in my boots."

"Well then," Thokmay said without missing a beat, "Do you think you could borrow
some?  Just for a little bit?" Little Gas nodded quickly and scurried away.

"Do you want the rest of us to get some socks, too?" Sensy asked.  She and Rash
had been standing with the younger children, their chores either done or
conveniently forgotten.

"Oh, Sensy!" Noxy said under her breath.

"If you like," Thokmay said, straightening up.  Sensy sprinted away.  A handful
of other children ran off as well.

Little Gas came puffing back with one pair of green socks, one pair of gray, and
one pair with red and white stripes on them.  "Will these do?" he asked, fishing
some stones out of his pocket.

"They look fine," said Thokmay.  "Now, give me your stones...  Good.  Now, let's
roll up the socks like this, with a stone in the middle, to make a ball.  See?
And then the next pair...  And the next...  All right, are you ready?"

Little Gas nodded.  Thokmay stepped back, took a deep breath, and threw the
balled-up socks into the air.  His hands darted back and forth like
hummingbirds.  Somehow, he managed to catch each sock ball before it fell to the
ground, and then throw it again in time to catch the next one.

There was a moment of stunned silence.  "That's magic!" Rash said accusingly.
"You're doing magic!"

"It's not magic," Grappa Gas laughed, looking as delighted as any of the
children.  "It's called juggling! I saw it in Chaghan once.  It's just a trick."

"That's right," Thokmay agreed, "It's just a trick.  Here, I'll prove it.
Sergeant?"

Sergeant Dorbu took the brightly colored sock balls and tossed them in the air,
one, two, three.  He whistled a happy little tune as he juggled, and even
managed to wink at Sensy (who blushed).  By the time he was finished, Little Gas
was laughing and clapping his hands.  "Let me, let me!" he shrieked.  "I want
to!"

"All right, but you have to let me show you how," Thokmay said.  "You have to
start with just two, like this.  Now, put this one in this hand, and this one in
the other, and..."

Noxy watched Little Gas drop all three pairs of socks, pick them up, and drop
them again.  The little boy laughed.  Seething, she sat back down on her pretend
cloud and glared at the bowl of thimbleberries.  It was going to be a long
day...

# The Bookster's Apprentice<br>Greg Wilson

*Take a squat pyramid of rock, four gallops square and two gallops
tall. Lift it into the air, then tilt it back like an old man looking
up at a rooftop, so that its leading edge rises gently to the central
peak, while its stern drops so steeply that only goats, birds, and a
small village called Aft Landing can find a foothold. Put a town of
some ten thousand souls on its bow, and smaller towns (not
villages---their inhabitants are quite definite about that) on its
port and starboard flanks. Bash its underside against stationary
mountains until it's ragged, and let rain, snow, and windblown sand
weather it for a few thousand years. That is Avaunt.*

*Now put it in motion. Eight months north from Mau Ngapcha to Normous
Berth, with half the world's chocolate in its warehouses, along with
cinnamon, cloves, silk, and cured bamboo as tough as stone. Two weeks
on the ground, while merchants from all over northern Cherne elbow
past each other to make bargains, and then another eight months in the
air with grain, cider, wool, and steel for the south.*

*When the Pilots ruled the world, Avaunt roamed across the world.
After they destroyed themselves, it was taken over by wild-eyed
tinkers with a fascination for the Pilots' strange machines. They
called themselves the Hett, and as the years passed, the people who
lived below them regarded them with growing suspicion. Stories spread
of the Hett's hoarded wealth, and of the plots they must be hatching
to one day rule the world as the Pilots had.*

*Eventually, an ambitious young prince with few prospects at home
decided to do more than mutter. The next time Avaunt landed at Normous
Berth, the rag-tag army he had recruited attacked. Most of the Hett
were slain outright.  The rest were driven off the mountain with
nothing but the clothes on their backs. It was barely spring, and
bitterly cold, and few survived.*

*The Hett's storied wealth turned out to consist of scrap metal and
books no one knew how to read. Undeterred, the prince retitled himself
the Captain of Avaunt, made his lieutenants bosuns, and gave the
Hett's houses and farms to his followers. Most of them smoked, drank,
or gambled away their gifts, but the rest settled down to trade, raise
families, and watch the world slip past beneath them.*

*Now, look closer. There, in Starboard Town. Five hundred years have
passed; it is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot, 1261. A girl is running
for her life. She just felt the mountain shake for the first time in
centuries, but that's not what she's afraid of. She's afraid of what
the boy chasing her will do to her if he gets his hands on her.*

Erileine raced down Slip Street twenty strides in front of her
pursuer.  She paid no attention to the frightened looks on the faces
of people she flew by.  "What just happened?" they asked one
another. The ground had shaken---had there been an avalanche? But then
why hadn't there been any noise?  No one had noticed yet that the sun
lay fifteen degrees away from where it had been. No one had realized
that for the first time since the Pilots fell, the flying mountain had
changed course mid-flight.

Past Donaien and Armaend's; past Fraederiq's house, where his father
Gaeston was just coming out onto the street, looking for someone to
blame for the bottles that had fallen off his shelves and shattered.
There---Mamaere Mayeule's tavern. Erileine cut right into the little
alley that ran between it and the smokehouse next door. She ran
blindly for a second, her eyes useless in the deep shadows after the
brightness of the morning, praying that Mamaere Mayeule hadn't left
any barrels out to air.

Fraederiq was only a dozen strides behind her when Erileine burst into
the little courtyard behind the tavern. She jumped over a chair,
banged her knee against a second without stopping, and pulled hrself
over the stone wall at the rear of the courtyard. The mountain wasn't
quite as steep there as it was around most of Starboard Town. It was
one of those places children were definitely not supposed to play,
which meant that she knew it as well as her tongue knew her
teeth. There was a narrow ledge thirty strides below that led to her
papaere's cottage. She'd be safe if she could get there. Safe for the
moment, anyway, and she could worry about what to do later then.

Fraederiq hardly broke stride as he flung himself over the wall behind
her. Erileine glanced over her shoulder as she slipped and slid down
the slope, scraping her hands as she grabbed at bushes to slow herself
down. Stones clattered past her as Fraederiq did the same. It was
going to be close...

"Whoa!" she cried, almost sliding past the ledge before her sturdy
boots found purchase. She grabbed hold of a strangle vine for balance,
yanked her arm away before the hungry plant could get a grip on her,
and quickstepped along the narrow shelf.

Fraederiq slid to a halt two heartbeats behind her. A trickle of
bloody spit made a dark wet track through the dust on his face. "I'm
going to throw you over the side, you little cake!" he shouted.

The ledge was barely a handspan wide. Pursued and pursuer both had to
shuffle, left foot to right, then right forward, hands grabbing
bushes, branches, roots, and outcroppings of rock for balance.

Erileine stumbled on a loose chip of stone. "Go on, jump!" Fraederiq
yelled. "Save me the trouble!"

"Jump yourself!" Erileine shouted back without turning her head. There
was nothing between her and the plains below but a gallop of empty
air. Left foot, right, left, right... She could see her papaere's
cottage. Just a few more steps, and---

Fraederiq's hand caught hold of her collar. "Gotcha!" the older boy
said triumphantly.

"Let go! Fraederiq, let go! I'm going to fall!" Erileine wriggled and
tried to twist free, her shirt pulling free of her trousers as
Fraederiq yanked her back.

Fraederiq's ugly grin widened. He let go of the roots he was holding and
pulled his hand back for a blow.

As he did so, the mountain shuddered again. Fraederiq's eyes widened
in sudden terror as he lost his balance. He let go of Erileine and
windmilled his arms.

"No!" Fraederiq shouted. He reached out desperately, but Erileine was
frozen against the mountainside. Off balance, his arms still flailing,
Fraederiq toppled backward into space and plummeted toward the dry
earth below.

Erileine clung to the mountain. "No, no, no..." she moaned, squeezing
her eyes shut so hard that speckles swirled beneath their lids. Her
arms tried to drive her fingers into the rock, to root her in the
mountain so that she wouldn't fall too.  This couldn't be
happening. Fraederiq couldn't be gone, not like that.  How could
Fraederiq just *fall*? And---and why hadn't she reached out to grab
him?

She bit her lip, her body shuddering as she tried to control her
sobs. She had to tell someone.  She had to get out of there before the
mountain shook again.

She took a deep, unsteady breath and forced her hands to relax, only
then realizing that they were sticky with blood. She had scraped her
palms and fingers raw on the mountain. Her forehead too---she must
have ground her face against the cliffside.

She turned her head to see how far it was to the end of the ledge. Twenty
strides, maybe less. She could do that. She had to.

She stood there, the wind of the mountain's passage ruffling her hair,
until she stopped shaking. With her face and chest pressed against the
rough, indifferent rock, she edged toward her papaere's one step at a
time.  Each time she moved her feet, she had to force herself to peel
her hands off the mountain. The air around her was filled with the
trills and caws of panicked birds. She felt oddly disconnected, as if
her body was moving itself and she was just watching.

The ledge finally merged with a steep hillside littered with sturdy
deep-rooted shrubs for her to hold onto. Without warning, the last of
her breakfast rose in her throat.

A minute later, she spat in a vain attempt to clear the taste from her
mouth, then wiped dust, sweat, blood, and tears from her face with the
tail of her shirt. What---Pilots and saints, what was she going to
tell Fraederiq's father?

Erileine stumbled shakily toward her papaere's cottage. Pine branches
slapped her face in silent reproach. She had been right there. Why
hadn't she just put out her hand? He might have pulled her off the
mountain with him, but that would be better than--- better than--- She
doubled over, heaving.

Vurt was on his verandah, cursing in a flat monotone when his
granddaughter stumbled out of the trees. "Eri!" he exclaimed, dropping
the old crossbow he'd been trying to reassemble onto the scarred table
beside him.

Erileine collapsed into her papaere's arms. "Eri? Eri!" Vurt shook
her. "Frogs on stilts, girl, you look like you've been a ghost! Are
you all right?"

Erileine shook her head. "I--- we--- Papaere, he fell. F-F-Fraederiq
fell.  When the m-m-mountain..." She buried her face in her papaere's
chest, her body racked by sobs again.

"What?" Vurt took Erileine's shoulders and gently pushed her back to
study her face. "Who fell?"

"F-F-Fraederiq. We were---"  Words failed her.  She jerked her head
back the way she had come.

"*Saad*," Vurt cursed. "Are you sure? Maybe he only slipped down a
ways."

Erileine shook her head miserably. "No, I s-s-saw him. He *fell*." She
wiped her nose on her sleeve. "Papaere, what happened to the
mountain?"

"I don't know," Vurt said grimly. "But it knocked me right over. And
look." He pointed at the sky. The sun was almost hidden behind the
roof of his cottage. "We've changed course. I'm guessing it's about a
quarter-quarter-arc. If your paere didn't still have my
weeping-be-damned sextant, I'd know better." His face darkened. "Now,
tell me what happened."

A flock of plausible lies flew through Erileine's mind. "We were on
the ledge below Mamaere Mayeule's," she confessed miserably. "He was
chasing me, and I thought if I could get here I'd be all right, but he
w-would have caught me if I'd come straight down Slip Street, so I---"
She broke off, unable to meet her papaere's eyes.

Vurt waited, his face expressionless. "I went over her back wall,"
Piaerre finished dully. "He came after me. We were halfway here when it
happened."

Vurt studied his granddaughter's face. "You know you're not supposed
to go there."

"I know," Erileine said wretchedly. "I'm sorry." Suddenly her eyes
widened. "What about maere and paere? And Queçenne?" She turned to run
up the stairs that led from Vurt's cottage to the lower end of
Starboard Town's single street.

Vurt caught her arm. "Hang on a heartbeat. You can't go up there
looking like that---you'll give your mother a fright. Go inside and
clean up a bit. There's water in the jug." He pushed his granddaughter
toward the cottage's front door, then stooped over to pick up his
crossbow, wincing as his knee cracked.

A moment later, the old brass wash jug clanged down on his kitchen
table, empty. The door opened. "You ready?" Vurt asked.

Erileine goggled at him, her dark face scrubbed clean but her eyes
still red from weeping.  "Papaere---what are you doing?"

Vurt frowned. "What does it look like I'm doing?"

Erileine looked at the sword slung at her grandfather's side, the
loaded crossbow in his hands, and the polished teak fangs of the
ankle-biter sticking out of the worn leather pack on his
back. "Starting a war?"

Vurt's frown turned to an angry. "Funny girl. I'd rather have it and
not need it than need it and not have it, that's all. Now come on." He
turned toward the stairs.

Piaerre hesitated. "What's wrong?" Vurt asked.

"Papaere---what am I going to tell Gaeston?"

Her grandfather's mouth twisted. "I don't know, love. Never have. Now
come on---your maere will be fretting herself sick."

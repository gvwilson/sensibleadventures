<p><em>Three Sensible Adventures</em> was my first book for children. I wrote it for my niece Allison's eighth birthdayâ€”everybody else in the family was making things for her, but I'm too clumsy to knit or use a hammer, so I decided to make her some stories instead. It was first published by Annick Press in 1999, just in time for her eleventh birthday, with wonderful artwork by Toronto's Bill Lytle.</p>

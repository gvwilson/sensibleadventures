A thousand years ago,
the Makers created dozens of hybrid species,
then vanished,
leaving behind half-human creatures with strange powers,
robots in need of parts and purpose,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.
This 35,000-word story for middle grade children (ages 8-10)
is set in that world.

## Places

-   Rusty Bridge: the small town where the story is set

    -   Mostly goats and bears with a few wolves and one elderly turtle
    -   The Roos are the only kangaroo family in town

## Plot

Each chapter is 1500-1800 words.

1.  Salvage
    -   Afternoon, chores over
    -   Maddy and Gumption return books to Sensei Reed and borrow new ones
    -   Sindy is waiting when they come out
    -   Maddy orders her home (character development)
        -   When Sindy gets upset, Maddy drops her book
        -   "Look what you made me do!" says Maddy (foreshadowing - turns out Sindy *did* make her do it)
    -   Bluster shows up and bullies them
    -   Maddy and Gumption sneak away to the river to get away from everything
    -   Salvage has washed up
    -   They know they should go tell adults, but Gumption is angry about Bluster's bullying
    -   Tries to drag some solar panels out of the water
    -   They shift, trapping his foot, then shift again, pulling him under the water!
    -   A rasping voice, "Alert!  Danger!  Extricate!  Extricate!"
2.  
    -   A battered bot bursts out of hiding
    -   Maddy shrieks, thinking it's about to attack, but it lifts the panel long enough for Gumption to get free
    -   Maddy is helping Gumption when the bot is struck by a dislodged piece of debris and knocked off its feet
        -   Collision knocks a small black aerial unit loose
    -   Gumption grabs it, tells Maddy to help ("It saved me, we gotta save it!")
    -   They struggle back to shore, during which the bot catches Maddy when she loses her footing
    -   Children don't know what to do
    -   Ask, "What are you doing here?"
    -   Bot
        -   "This is unable to---" stops, tentatively reaches up to broken aerial unit.
        -   "This now appears able to reply.  This is part of a sneak attack on Location Six Forty Six, also referred to as 'Rusty Bridge'."
        -   Children: "Attack? When?"
        -   *Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think, then brightened.  "Tonight."*

## Quotes

"Because there used to be a rusty bridge here," Dickety said slowly.
"We tried to repair it but we did not have parts."
Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think.
"Searching...
Yes.
It fell down.
I remember."

"My grandmother is barely out of her egg when it happens,"
Sensei Reed confirmed in a slow whisper.
"It is winter.
There is a terrible storm,
much wind,
much ice.
When the bridge comes crashing down,
people say,
the Makers are angry,
we should leave this place,
but others say no,
this is our home,
we will make our own bridge."

"Because if we clean up this mess and put things back the way they were
then the Makers will come back and everything will be *better*,"
Tasercase hissed.
"No more rust.
No more oh, I regret, we do not have that part."
It waved its mis-matched manipulators for emphasis.

"That is just phase one of its plan," Dickety said.

Sensei Reed sighed.
"Why do villains' plans always have phases?
Why can't they just get on with it and do some evil?"

  <h1>Arecibo Mon Amour</h1>

</div>

**Wurdi Youang / Actual minus 12,000 years**

She had given up her name long ago.
It had been heavy---too heavy to carry as deep into the Dreaming as she needed to go.
She had missed it at first,
but everyone who had known her by that name was dead now,
and it amused her when others called her the Old Woman behind her back.
At some point,
she really ought to tell them that being mostly blind didn't affect her hearing...

Footsteps crunched on the stream's gravel bank.
She sighed as the fish she had been hoping to catch darted away.
"Who's there?" she asked,
the stream caressing her knees as she turned to face whoever had frightened her dinner away.

"It's Wharru," the young man said.
"There's a stranger in camp."
He was one of the new arrivals,
still thin and angry after his long trek from the drowning lands.
His clan had lost their farms to the ever-rising sea,
and many had been killed or enslaved.
It would be many years before he was ready to let go of the weight of that,
but he had helped realign some of her stones without complaint
and didn't snore or fart nearly as much as some of the others.

"From down below?" she asked,
sloshing through the stream to join him.

"I don't think so."
Wharru hesitated.
"He's not like any real people I've ever seen.
Alinta thinks he might be a bad spirit."

"Feh."
The old woman picked up the walking stick and skin bag
that together were half of everything she could call her own.
"Alinta thinks *everyone* is a bad spirit.
Come on, let's go meet them."

The strangers weren't in camp.
"I told him to wait for you,"
Alinta said without preamble,
her voice as sharp as the stone knife in her hand.
"I told him it's a powerful place,
you shouldn't go there without her,
you'll make the ancestors angry,
but no,
*he* wanted to see the *sunset*."
She set aside her knife,
grabbed the feet of the gweela she was dressing with one hand,
and pulled hard with the other.
The bird's skin came off 
with a sound that never failed to make the old woman's stomach turn.

The old woman sighed to herself.
The half-dozen people doing chores within earshot had paused their conversations
to listen to Alinta.
They would follow her once the old woman joined the ancestors,
and in her heart,
the old woman knew that would be the end of the stones.

She jerked her chin at the dripping carcass in Alinta's hands.
"Enough there for company?"

Alinta scowled.
"Hardly enough for *us*."

The old woman nodded.
"Well, do what you can to stretch it.
Come along."
She dug her elbow into Wharru's ribs.
"Let's go see what this evil spirit of yours wants."

They walked side by side through the long shadows beneath the gum trees.
The old woman had been going up and down that part of the mountainside for almost thirty years,
and took quiet pleasure in thinking that the packed earth was
her own footsteps echoing back at her.
Birds and insects filled the forest with sound,
and once something larger made the bushes rustle.
Wharru hesitated but the old woman pushed on.
A thylacine wouldn't attack two people together,
and no one had seen a marsupial lion in the mountains for years.

They reached the field of stones just as the sun was about to kiss the horizon.
There wasn't a cloud in the sky,
and if the stranger hadn't been there the old woman would have put Wharru to work
sighting along the stones
and marking new positions for them.

But the stranger *was* there,
and even with eyes half-blinded by years of looking too closely at the sun,
the old woman thought that for once Alinta might be right.
He was taller than any real person the old woman had ever seen
and completely hairless.
An angry young scar ran from his left temple almost to the back of his head,
rough and red against his near-black skin.

He turned as Wharru and the old woman approached him.
She blinked.
His little man was as small as a baby's and he had no bag at all that she could see.

She cleared her throat to greet him,
but before the words could leave her mouth he said,
"It does not measure well enough."

Wharru stiffened beside her at the stranger's rudeness.
"Show respect," he said sharply.

She put a cautionary hand on his arm.
"What do you mean, not well enough?"

The stranger gestured at the oval of basalt that had taken the old woman a lifetime to assemble.
There were exactly one hundred and twenty one stones,
each with a name known only to the old woman and whoever had helped her place it.
She could have picked some up one-handed,
but others had taken two people and a wooden travois to move,
and each of the waist-high trio at the oval's sunset end
had needed a year of hard work to haul up the mountain and put in place.

"I need to know..."
The stranger paused and blinked rapidly several times.
"This language does not have the words.
I need to know a moment."
He gestured at the scar on his head.
"My people can only hear me at some moments,
but I am damaged.
I do not know when those moments are any more.
I must add to find them.
I need to measure to add,
but this does not measure well enough."

The old woman clucked her tongue.
"I don't understand.
Do you want to add a stone?"
Was part of his spirit lost in the Dreaming?
She had seen it before.
A stone had struck a man on the head.
He had not woken for two days;
when he finally did he moved slowly and was confused by the simplest things.

The stranger shook his head.
"No.
'Add' is not right.
I need to---this language does not have the words.
I need to count the spaces between the stars to know when my people will be able to hear me.
What you have built does measure well enough.
It is of no use."

"It is of great use!" Wharru said hotly.
"It tells us when the seasons will turn and what path the moon will take.
It tells us when the ancestors are closest to us!"

The stranger did not reply to that.
He just looked at the old woman.
He knew, she realized.
Somehow he knew what she had never admitted to anyone, living or dead.
She wasn't sure whether what she told the others about the ancestors being nearer at certain times was true or not.
What she *was* sure of---what she knew in her bones---was that
there were patterns in the stars and the lights that wandered among them,
and that those patterns *meant* something.

"I must look elsewhere," the stranger said abruptly.
With nothing more than that he started to walk past them.

Wharru caught his arm.
"Are they all so rude where you come from?" he demanded.

"Wharru, don't," the old woman protested,
but the young man ignored her.
He had fought and killed on his way to the mountain,
and in that sunset moment she could see his battles in the way he shifted his weight,
ready to strike or to fend off a blow.

But that blow never came.
With a rasping roar,
the lion that had been creeping closer while they were distracted
burst out of the trees behind them.

The old woman to scream as the lion knocked her to the ground.
A dazzling pain like she had never imagined shot up her spine as her hip broke,
then something cracked and the lion went limp.
The stranger had broken its neck with his bare hands
as easily as someone might break a dry twig.

He carried her down the mountain as if she were a baby
while Wharru ran ahead to tell the others what had happened.
She passed out several times,
only to be dragged back into the world by the agony in her hip.
"Who *are* you?" she asked,
or dreamed that she asked,
in a moment of lucidity.

The stranger glanced down at her.
"I don't know."

When they reached camp he set her down gently,
turned,
and walked away without a word.

*Later,
Alinta poked at the lion's protruding ribs
and said it must have been desperate with hunger.
It was the last lion they ever saw---the last one *anyone* ever saw.
She made a cloak from its pelt,
but it was lost in a flood many years later and many miles away.
The old woman lived another season,
but was never able to go back up the mountain to track the sun and moon and stars with her stones.
She wondered sometimes who the stranger had been
and whether he had ever found a way count the spaces between the stars.*

**Chankillo / Actual minus 3400 years**

As a child,
Second Bird's diet consisted of maize, beans, the occasional roasted guinea pig,
and his grandfather's stories of the war.
The First People had risen up against the highlanders' god-king many times.
Each rebellion had ended the same way,
with entire families staked out in the desert as gifts to the sun
and ever-harsher conditions for the survivors.

"So we wept and we *learned*," Fast Rock said,
grunting the last word as he turned over a spadeful of damp soil.
He and Second Bird had been working to clear this irrigation channel for nine days.
It was slow, slippery, back-breaking work,
but Second Bird didn't mind:
all of the other chores were just as hard,
and he would rather listen to his grandfather's stories
than to the imprisoned god-king's endless tirades.

Fast Rock drove his spade into the ground again.
"The trick was,"
heave,
"We all had,"
heave,
"To rise,"
heave,
"together."
He paused a moment to wipe sweat from his brow
while Second Bird dragged the woven reed basket full of soil out of the way
and pushed an empty one into place.
One more basket and they would trade places.
Four more after that would make eight for them to carry a hundred strides
to fill the gap where the riverbank had given way.

The numbers danced in Second Bird's head.
They had made six such journeys so far that day
and would make another eight before the day ended.
Six plus eight was ten with four.
Ten with four upon itself nine times was five twenties with six.
If they were half done---he glanced at the river to check yet again---then yes,
they would made ten twenties with ten and two trips by the time they were done.
At eight baskets a trip,
that would be---

The ground shook.
Ripples danced across the flat stinking water in the irrigation channel.
Someone shouted a warning two channels over.
Someone else screamed.

"Grandfather!" he shouted.
He grabbed Fast Rock's outstretched hand and pull the old man up out of the channel.
The spade whacked his shin.
Later,
he would realize that it had cut him,
and would go back and burn some herbs to cleanse the ground where his blood had been spilled,
but at that moment he thought the world was ending.

Fast Rock dropped the spade on the ground
and drew the knife that always hung at his waist.
"Come with me!" he ordered.

"Where are we going?" Second Bird asked,
running after him.

"The evil one," Fast Rock said grimly.
"He must not escape."

Every handspan of green land was a gift from the gods.
Even the highlanders had understood that,
and had built their villages where the green ended and the hard dry desert began.
Most of those villages were empty now,
home only to wild creatures and ghosts.
Second Bird had ventured into the nearest one occasionally on a dare,
marveling at the carved stones and at streets wide enough for six people to walk side by side.
He had never gone to the center,
though,
and neither had any of the other children.
Only the old men went there,
and even they only went in pairs.

A building had collapsed.
Second Bird counted the jumbled stones at a glance.
"Grandfather---" he began.

"Good," the old man panted,
slowing to a walk.
He gestured with his knife.
"The sooner...
they come down...
the sooner...
our gods will come back."
And end the drought,
he didn't add.
He didn't need to:
every one of the First People's prayers had begged for that for six long years.

They came around a corner and face-to-face with a nightmare.
The highlanders' nameless god-king stood in front of the collapsed wall
of the storehouse where the First People had imprisoned him.
Two old men stood opposite him,
spears clutched in their hands.

Without thinking
Second Bird grabbed his grandfather's arm.
"Wait," he hissed.
The god-king was faster and stronger than any mortal being.
It had taken a dozen men to subdue him,
and the only one to survive his wounds from that battle
could not beat him with only a knife.

Fast Rock smacked his grandson's hand away and advanced slowly,
his knife held low.
One of the old men glanced at him and nodded,
shifting to the side to make a space for him.

"So," Fast Rock said after a moment.
"What now?"

The god-king was a head taller than anyone Second Bird had ever seen,
with skin like charcoal and an old scar on the left side of his head.
Naked,
thin from years of starvation,
and covered in dust,
he was still more frightening than Second Bird had ever imagined.

"I said, what now?" Fast Rock demanded.

The god-king blinked as if waking.
"I need to see the stars," he said abruptly,
and then turned and walked away.

The two old men looked at Fast Rock helplessly.
"Get help," the old man ordered,
taking the nearest one's spear.
"Get *everyone*.
It's time we ended this."

"But---"

"Now!"
he bellowed,
and the old man took off at a run.

Fast Rock bared his teeth.
"Let's go hunting."

They followed the god-king into the desert.
At first Second Bird thought he was headed for the fortress that the highlanders had built
when they first swept down over the valleys,
but he walked past it without a glance.
That left the towers,
thirteen of them in a row on a ridge looking west,
each one built at a cost of dozens of lives.

Others joined them,
some carrying spears,
others with whatever tools they had been using when the earth shook.
Two men had thought to bring a net like the one Fast Rock and his companions had used
to ensnare the god-king on the day of the rising,
and an old woman had come with a pouch of herbs to burn for good fortune
and a needle and thread for wounds.

Ten twenties of twenties of strides brought them to the stone steps that led up to the first tower.
Second Bird counted each one automatically
and wondered for a moment if the number being so clean was some kind of sign.

The god-king stood alone at the top of the tower.
"Should we set an ambush?" one of the men carrying the net hissed at Fast Rock.

The old man snorted.
"How?"
There was no way to get above the tower stairs and nothing to hide behind.

He gestured at the nearest men.
"Spread out.
When he comes down, you three get behind him, but wait for my word.
We must all attack at once."

"Attack?"
one man said incredulously.
"Him?"

"He has been in prison longer than my grandson has been alive,"
Fast Rock said curtly.
"He will be weak."

"Didn't *look* weak," the man said under his breath,
but he took a position.

They waited.
And waited.
Finally Fast Rock cupped his hands around his mouth.
"What are you doing up there?" he shouted.

People gasped.
Monster or not, the god-king was---you didn't yell at gods!

But he replied.
"I am looking at the stars,"
he called down.

"Bit early for that, isn't it?" Fast Rock yelled up.
"I mean, wouldn't it be better to wait until they're actually there?"

"The stars are always there."
There was a moment of silence.
"It is good to see them again."

Second Bird looked questioningly at his grandfather.
The old man shrugged,
then tensed as the god-king came down the steps.

The other men shuffled into a semi-circle around him
when he reached the bottom.
The god-king looked past them at the thin green ribbon of life running through the desert.
"These are hard times for you,"
he said.

Fast Rock shrugged.
"Better than your time was.
But it'll get better."

The god-king shook his head.
"No, it will not.
This is a new---" he hesitated.
"Balance.
A new balance of long weather.
It cannot sustain the numbers it once did.
This valley cannot keep as many people as this work needs.
I must build my tools elsewhere."

He took a step forward,
pulling up short only when the tip of Fast Rock's spear touched his chest.
"Your 'tools'?" the old man snarled.
"Is that what you call this?
We *died* here, monster.
We died and died and died to build---what?"

"A way to measure the stars,"
the god-king said evenly.
"I need to measure them very exactly to know when I can speak with my people."

And just like that a lifetime of puzzle pieces fit together in Second Bird's head.
"The solstice," he breathed.

The god-king swivelled to look at Second Bird in a motion more lizardly than human.
"Yes.
It is a start,
but by itself it is not nearly good enough.
These tools are not good enough."
His wave took in the towers,
the people,
and the entire river valley.

"Not *good* enough?" Fast Rock snarled.
"We have *bled*.
We have *died*.
We have bowed our heads for a hundred years,
and you say it's not *enough*?"
He lunged.

The god-king slapped the spear-thrust aside as if he was swatting a fly.
One of the men behind him took a step.
Without even looking,
the god-king raised a hand to point straight at him.
"Do not," he said flatly.
Further around the circle,
the two men with the net shuffled their feet but made no move.

Fast Rock spat at the god-king's feet.
"So now what?
Are we to be your slaves again?"

The god-king shook his head slowly.
"No."
For the first time Second Bird heard emotion in his voice---regret,
perhaps,
or something close to it.
"I cannot build the tools I need by myself,
and the long weather here is too unreliable for your people to complete them.
I must look elsewhere."
He turned and walked into the desert without another word.

*Later---much later---Second Bird took his grandchildren to the towers.
He told them the story of the god-king
and showed them how to predict the changing seasons by which stars lined up with which towers.
As he fell asleep one final time,
he wondered if the god-king had ever found someone who could build what he needed.*

**Gyeongju / Actual minus 2300 years**

"It was Her Majesty's first decree as princess,"
the young astrologer said,
immediately hating himself for telling such a distinguished scholar
something he undoubtedly already knew.

But the visitor from the Middle Kingdom smiled politely as he studied the star-gazing tower.
It was the height of five men,
and to the enlightened eye,
the number and placement of its stones represented historical and astronomical figures.
"I understand her decision was... not universally popular," he said.

The young astrologer inclined his head,
conscious of their escorts standing a few feet away.
"Not universally popular" didn't quite capture the way the conservative aristocracy had felt
about a woman ascending to the throne,
particularly when the Taizong Emperor refused to acknowledge her,
but it was neither polite nor prudent to dwell upon that.

"And this must be the foreign barbarian I have heard so much about,"
the visitor continued
as a tall figure in the plain brown robe of a monk
came up the gravel path in the waning evening light.

The young astrologer inclined his head again.
He was no longer taken aback by the foreigner's dark skin,
but would never get used to how quietly he walked.
"Are you at peace?" he asked in greeting.

"I am, and you?"
He had forgotten to wear sandals again,
the young astrologer noted,
but according to the caretaker he had at least eaten that day.
Her Majesty's minister insisted on regular reports,
and the young astrologer would much rather fill them with trivia like that
than even hint at some of the things the foreigner said.

He cleared his throat.
"May I have the honor of introducing you to scholar Liu Zhao,
who has come from the court of the Gaozong Emperor?
I apologize for any appearance of poor manners,"
he continued,
turning to the visitor,
"But my colleague has no name by which to be introduced."

Scholar Liu raised a perfectly groomed eyebrow.
"Not even a temple name?"

"I am not a monk,"
the foreigner said.
"I have simply misplaced it."
He brushed a finger over the scar that wrinkled the left side of his head.

The scholar smiled.
"And to think there are those who spend their lifetimes trying to let go of such things."
He gestured at the tower.
"It is quite marvelous."

The foreigner nodded.
"It has been very useful."

"Mm."
Scholar Liu jerked his chin at the scrolls
whose ends stuck out of his satchel.
"I have heard much about the records you have made.
I am told they are extremely precise."

The foreigner gave a small shrug.
"As precise as they can be.
Improving them will be the work of many lifetimes."

The young astrologer's heart skipped a beat.
The foreigner had the keenest eyes and most prodigious memory of anyone the younger astrologer had ever met---of
anyone he'd ever heard of---but even for a follower of the Quiet Sage,
his views were sometimes...unorthodox.

He opened his mouth to say something diverting,
but was interrupted by a shout as a guard came running up the path.
"Her Majesty..." he panted,
speaking to the two escorts rather than to the scholars.
"Her Majesty is gone. She is gone."

The soft buzz of dusk insects was the only sound in the shocked silence that followed.
"Stay here,"
the older escort ordered the three scholars.
He hurried away with his partner and the messenger in tow.

Scholar Liu turned to the foreigner.
"Come with me,"
he said without preamble.
"Come with me to the court of the Gaozong Emperor.
You will have a dozen towers like this one,
and a dozen scribes to record your findings."

The young astrologer's jaw dropped.
Were all the courtiers of the Middle Kingdom so callous?

The foreigner studied Scholar Liu for a moment,
then shook his head.
"You honor me," he said,
"And perhaps some day I will make that journey.
But tonight,
my colleague and I have work to do."

The hungry expression on Scholar Liu's face melted,
leaving anger in its wake.
"As you choose," he said coldly.
"If you will excuse me?"
He strode away,
the gravel scraping under his sandals.

The young astrologer turned to the foreigner.
"Being invited to the emperor's court is quite an honor,"
he ventured cautiously.
"And there are many fine scholars there with whom you could converse."

The foreigner nodded.
"I'm sure there are.
But I find no deficiency of any kind in those I know here."
And for the first time since the young astrologer had met him,
he smiled.

**Maragheh / Actual minus 1700 years**

A zij is an Islamic astronomical book that tabulates parameters used for astronomical calculations of the positions of the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets. Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Tusi (1201-74) was a Persian polymath who created very accurate tables of planetary motion, and is often credited with establishing trigonometry as a discipline in its own right (and possibly a precursor to Copernicus via uncredited work). Hulagu Khan created an observatory for Tusi at Maragheh in the 13th century. The facility became inactive in the 14th century after losing patronage, and was ruined by a series of earthquakes. The contents of its library were stolen during the Mongol invasion, but the remains inspired Ulugh Beg to construct an observatory in Samarkand in 1428.

**Uraniborg / Actual minus 1400 years**

Uraniborg was built between 1576 and 1580 on the island of Hven by Tycho Brahe, then expanded to Stjerneborg after it turned out that tower-mounted instruments swayed too much in the wind. Brahe abandoned the site in 1597 after he fell out of favor with the Danish king Christian IV; it was destroyed in 1601. It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe.

A "Jantar Mantar" is a giant sundial with a triangular gnomon whose hypotenuse is parallel to the Earth's axis. On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle parallel to the plane of the equator. The instrument can measure the time of day to an accuracy of half a second. "Yantra mantar" means "calculation instrument". There were five, but the one in Mathura was torn down just before the Revolt of 1875 (possibly just neglect and scavenging).

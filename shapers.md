*Shapers and Bots* is a role-playing game for children age 8 and older.
It is inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
countless stories of talking animals,
and my daughter.
Each game has one or more *players* and one *Director*.
Each player takes on the role of one character,
while the Director plays the part of all the non-player characters.
(The Director is often an adult or the person who created the adventure.)

> Note:
> these rules are derived from Atomic Sock Monkey's PDQ rules.

## Background

Thousands of years ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals to create dozens of thinking species,
then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels:
half-human creatures with strange powers
thinking machines that are now their own masters,
and things both wonderful and terrifying.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you can play the part of a young animal adventurer or a newly-conscious bot
trying to find its place in the world.
You can be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and can travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds.

## Game Mechanics

Every character in *Shapers and Bots* is described by a handful of *traits*.
Everything a character might want to do---climb a wall,
sing a song,
or persuade an angry bear not to throw them overboard---has a *difficulty*.
Together,
the two determine the odds of the character doing what they want to do.

Every one of a character's traits has a *rating*
with a name and an associated *modifier*:

| Trait Rating | Modifier |
| ------------ | -------: |
| Very Low     | -4       |
| Low          | -2       |
| Average      | 0        |
| High         | +2       |
| Very High    | +4       |
| Extreme      | +6       |

Similarly,
every difficulty has a level and a *target*:

| Task Difficulty | Target |
| --------------- | -----: |
| Trivial         | 3      |
| Easy            | 5      |
| Average         | 7      |
| Hard            | 9      |
| Challenging     | 11     |
| Impossible      | 13     |

When a character wants to do something,
she rolls two six-sided dice (abbreviated "2D")
and adds the modifier for her trait.
If the total is equal to or greater than the target for the task,
she succeeds;
if it is less,
she fails.

Here are a couple of examples:

1. Shau Sheu has a High rating for Climbing, and wants to climb an Average wall.
   She rolls two dice and gets a 3 and a 4.
   Adding them together, and adding another 2 for her Good rating,
   gives a total of 9.
   This is greater than the 7 needed to do an Average task,
   so she succeeds.

2. Shau Sheu now needs to climb a slippery icefall.
   The task is challenging,
   so she needs to get 11 or better to do it.
   She rolls 2 and 6, adds 2 for her Good rating:
   nope.
   The total is only 10,
   so she slips and falls.

## Characters

Every character has these four traits:

- **Size**: how large the character is.
  In exceptional cases,
  a character may have separate **Height** and **Weight** traits
  instead of a single Size trait.

- **Fitness**: how strong and coordinated the character is,
  i.e.,
  how athletic they are.

- **Dexterity**: how good the character is at delicate manipulations
  like picking a lock or playing a musical instrument.

- **IQ**: how good the character is at book learning and puzzle solving.
  Note that a character with a low IQ is not necessarily stupid.

All of a character's traits are Average unless otherwise noted.
Every animal character may also have ratings for **Sight**, **Hearing**, and **Smell**.
These are all Average too unless otherwise noted,
so they usually don't need to be written down.

> Note: Smell includes the sense of taste.

Non-player characters (NPCs) may have two extra traits:

- **Courage**: how brave the character is.

- **Honesty**: how likely the character is to tell the truth.

Player characters (PCs) don't have scores for these
because it's up to the player to be brave
and to tell the truth (or not).
NPCs only need to be given scores for these traits
when it's important to the game.

## Species

Each species of animal character has different "normal" ratings for traits:

| Species   | Size      | Fitness   | Dexterity | Sight     | Hearing | Smell | Special            |
| --------- | --------: | --------: | --------: | --------: | ------: | ----: | ------------------ |
| bear      | High      | High      | Low       | Low       |         | High  |                    |
| bison     | High      |           | Very Low  | Low       |         |       | horns              |
| eagle     | Low       | Very High |           | Very High | High    | Low   | flying             |
| elephant  | Very High |           |           |           |         |       | prehensile trunk   |
| fox       | Low       |           | High      | High      |         |       | carnivore          |
| goat      |           |           |           |           |         |       | horns              |
| kangaroo  |           | High      |           |           |         |       | leaping            |
| lion      |           | High      |           |           | High    | High  | carnivore          |
| monkey    | Low       |           | Very High | High      |         |       | prehensile tail    |
| rabbit    | Very Low  |           |           |           | High    | High  | may go berserk     |
| raccoon   | Low       |           | Very High | High      |         |       |                    |
| rhino     | High      |           | Very Low  | Low       |         | High  |                    |
| tiger     |           | High      |           |           | High    | High  | carnivore          |
| turtle    | Low       | Low       | High      | Very Low  |         |       |                    |
| wolf      |           | High      |           |           | High    | High  | carnivore          |
| zebra     |           |           |           |           |         |       |                    |

*Example:
Larrapin is a 15-year-old rabbit, so her ratings are:*

- *Size: Very Low.*
- *Fitness: Average*
- *Dexterity: Average*
- *IQ: Average*
- *Sight: Average*
- *Hearing: High*
- *Smell: High*

## Shaping

A small number of animal characters have psychic powers
that let them control the world with their mind.
This is called *shaping*,
and is almost always attuned to one aspect of reality.
Those who have one of these abilities typically start with a rating of Very Low,
which slowly improves with practice and training.
The six most common kinds of shaping are:

-  **Earth**: dirt and stone. Very experienced earth shapers can also shape metal.

-  **Air**: wind.

-  **Fire**: flames.

-  **Water**: in its liquid form. Very experienced shapers can also shape ice.

-  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.

-  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.  (Nobody can stop or reverse time, or see the future.)

It is extremely rare for someone to be able to do more than one kind of shaping,
and no one can shape opposites:
Earth and Air,
Fire and Water,
Luck and Time.

*Example:
Larrapin is a water shaper.
Before her grandfather passed away,
he taught her what little he knew,
so her score is now Low instead of Very Low.*

## Skills

Every character has skills that they're particularly good at.
A skill is recorded as a *bonus*:
+1 means a little knowledge,
+2 is more,
and so on.
A score of 4 or more is very good,
and a score or 6 or higher is generally considered an expert.

Every time a character needs to do something difficult,
their player or the Director rolls three dice to see if they succeeded or not.
If the total of the three dice is less than or equal to the number they need,
they succeed.
If the total is greater than that number,
they fail.

The number needed,
called the *target*,
is the value of one of the player's traits,
plus their skill (if they have one),
minus the difficulty of the task.

Some useful skills are listed below with the trait they add to.
If two traits are listed,
the character's basic ability is the average of those two traits rounded down
(so that it is never less than the lower of their two trait scores).
If the basic skill is "--",
it means that characters don't have any natural ability:
everything has to be learned from scratch.

Characters may also have *knowledge*
of history, a language, mathematics, science,
or some other specialized field.
A character's knowledge of any field is initially zero,
and must all be learned.

The Director may allow players to choose skills for their characters
that are not on this list.

*Example:
Larrapin doesn't have any bonuses for Acting,
so her ability is 12,
which is the average of her Coordination (13) and her IQ (11).
Having grown up in the mountains,
though,
she has learned how to ski very well:
her natural ability is 13 (her Coordination),
and her bonus is +3,
giving her a total skill of 16.*

*Example:
Suppose Larrapin is trying to escape a band of angry (and hungry) wolves.
The Director decides that ski-jumping over a ravine has a difficulty of 6.
Larrapin's target is therefore 16-6, or 10.
She rolls three dice and gets a 7: success!*

## Fighting

Sometimes adventurers are attacked and have to fight their way out of trouble.
When this happens,
players must roll dice to score hits on their enemies.
Their ability is calculated as usual based on their traits
and their skill with whatever weapon they're using.
The difficulty, however, depends on the nature of the thing they're trying to hit.

FIXME: fill in.

## Bots

The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning floors to mining the ocean floor.
Since the Makers disappeared,
the bots left behind have improvised repairs however they could
to keep themselves going.
The result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike.
One might have six short legs and a pair of mis-matched claws for arms,
while another might use two rotor fans to fly,
but have only a single slender manipulator to pick things up.

Bots have Size, Fitness, Coordination, and IQ scores just like living characters.
Their Sight and Hearing scores are Average by default,
but only a few bots have any sense of smell or taste at all.
(Most regard smell as slightly icky,
and would prefer that living creatures didn't talk about it so much.)

## Example Characters

### Madica

Madica is a teenage fox girl.
She's a bit on the small side,
even for her species,
but she has worked on her parents' fishing boat every day since she was a child,
so she is quite healthy.
She has a keen nose,
and is also very good with her hands:
she's had a lot of practice tying knots and mending nets,
and her mother has taught her a few magic tricks.
She recently discovered that she can shape wind a little bit,
and desperately wants to find someone to teach her how to do more.

| **Trait**     | **Score** | **Skill**     | **Score** |
| ------------- | --------: | ------------- | --------: |
| Size          |         5 | Boating       |        +3 |
| Health        |        12 | Fishing       |        +2 |
| Coordination  |        13 | Swimming      |        +4 |
| Strength      |         6 | Stage Magic   |        +2 |
| Smell         |        12 | Water Shaping |        +2 |

### Rhymes With Orange

Rhymes With Orange was built to clean windows on ultra-tall skyscrapers.
It has long spidery limbs with suction cups for climbing,
but a very small body.
It also has a storage tank built into its back that can hold up to 5 liters,
and has modified the water jets on its arms to squirt almost any kind of liquid.
Rhymes With Orange's battery was damaged years ago
in an accident that robbed it of most of its memories.
It can only go 9-10 days without being recharged by another bot,
so it is constantly doing odd jobs in exchange for power
or gambling to try to win a recharge.
(It only cheats when it has to.)

| Trait        | Score | **Skill**   | **Score** |
| ------------ | ----: | ----------- | --------: |
| Height       |    12 | Acrobatics  |        +5 |
| Weight       |     7 | Climbing    |        +5 |
| Coordination |    10 | Gambling    |        +4 |
| Strength     |    11 | Squirt      |        +3 |

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight thousand
gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to west.  Its single
continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer shore, the
Worldrim, rises up to cradle that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a
drop of water in her hand.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well.
Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a war that scarred the moon and
turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass.  When it was over the Pilots were
gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.*

*Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the
endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms.  it is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot,
1272, and a girl who is no longer a child but not quite yet a woman is crouched
on a cloud, chilled to the bone and desperately hoping that they're not too
late...*

"Hold on!" Grappa Gas bellowed.  "It's going to get bumpy!"

Noxy dropped to one knee, pulled the glove off her left hand, and pressed her
palm against the cloud beneath her.  She could mind-hear Big Blue's
determination, but the cloud was old, older even than Grappa Gas, and they were
flying straight into a headwind.

*Faster!* she urged.  *Please, faster!* She shivered despite her yakskin hat and
coat, her hand already numbed by the icy mountain air.

Up ahead, a makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose like an
island out of the forest.  A dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire.
Shading her eyes with her right hand, Noxy saw that the soldiers had formed a
circle around it.  Their kilts and sturdy boots were travel-stained, and their
battle masks and lacquered leather armor were scarred from fighting.  Some had
swords in their hands, while others held spears or bows.  Big Blue's mate Pillow
floated above them, her sides rippling as she struggled to keep station in the
wind, but the soldiers weren't looking at the clouds.  They were looking at the
trees around them, waiting for the forest to attack.

"You're coming in too low!" Granna Fee yelled.  Noxy's grandmother lay full
length on Big Blue, propped up on her elbows with a pair of binoculars in her
hands.  "Level him off!"

"There's no time!" Grappa Gas yelled back, his red-and-yellow scarf flapping
madly behind him.  "We have to do a dumble!"  The old man closed his eyes.  His
lips moved as he mind-spoke commands to the cloud beneath him.  Noxy mind-heard
the old bull protest, but even as he grumbled he bunched up and went into a
steep dive.

Noxy had just a moment to think, *I'd be grounded for a month if I even thought
about trying something like this,* and then the cloud thudded against the side
of the peak like a sack full of wet wool.  Nox yelped and sprawled forward to
land in an untidy heap beside Granna Fee.  "Sorry!" she said, but her
grandmother was already up, swaying to keep her balance as the cloud scraped
across bare rock, flattened two tents, and came to a halt.

"What are you waiting for!?" Granna Fee shouted at the soldiers, sliding down
Big Blue's flank and waving her arm as if to sweep them all onto the cloud.
"Get on! Get on!"

As Noxy scrambled to her feet, Grappa Gas caught her arm.  "I'll help 'em up.
You stay here and keep Blue together."  Without waiting for her to answer he
stumped forward, his peg leg leaving dimples in the cloud.  "And keep an eye out
for squirrels!" he added over his shoulder.

Noxy glanced back just in time to see something big and brown swing between two
trees below them.  Another hairy shape followed it, then another, and suddenly
the trees were full of them, hooting and shaking the branches.

"Grappa!  Grappa, there's trolls!" she shouted.

"I see 'em!" the old man shouted back.

"And bears!" Noxy added as a brown bear charged out of the trees and reared up
on its hind legs with a roar.  The muscles under its thick fur bunched as it
dropped back to all fours to charge forward a few steps, halt, and roar again.

"'Course there's bears," Grappa Gas grunted as he clasped hands with the nearest
soldier and helped him scramble up onto the cloud.  A second soldier tossed his
spear aside and pulled himself up beside the first.  Together, they reached back
and hauled up a third man while Grappa Gas reached for a fourth.

But instead of grabbing the cloudherd's hand, the man on the ground lifted a
heavy canvas-wrapped bundle.  "Never mind that, get yourself up here!" Grappa
Gas ordered.

"We'll not leaving these!" the man on the ground yelled back.  One of the
soldiers already on the cloud shouldered Grappa Gas aside, grabbed a corner of
the canvas, and tried to drag it onto the cloud.  His legs sank halfway to his
knees with the weight.

Noxy felt Big Blue shudder underneath her.  She dropped to her knees and pressed
her hand against the cloud once again.  *Just a little longer,* she pleaded,
trying to squelch her fear so that he couldn't mind-hear it.  *Stay bunched up
just a little longer.* She pictured the cloud pulling itself into a dense blob.
Obediently the cloud began to contract.

But even as it did so, Noxy heard a shrill warning whistle from the cloudherds
on board Pillow high above them.  Cold fear jellied in her gut as the trolls
suddenly stopped hooting.

"Grappa---" she started to say.

"I heard it!" Grappa Gas snapped.  Cursing, he yanked another soldier up onto
the cloud.  This one was just a boy, Noxy realized, no older than she was with a
frightened, determined look on his scarred face.  He took two steps before his
feet slipped out from underneath him and sent him sprawling beside one of the
half-dozen canvas-wrapped bundles that lay together in a pile.

"Spread yourselves out, you numbskulls!" Grappa Gas thundered.  "Come on, Fee,
we gotta fly!"

Noxy's grandmother clambered up Big Blue's flank with a speed born from decades
of practice.  "Now or never!" she yelled at the soldier who had been lifting up
the bundles.  He sheathed his sword and grabbed a handful of cloud just as a
swarm of squirrels burst out of the forest and surged up the rocky slope like an
angry chattering wave.

*Up!* Noxy mind-yelled at Big Blue.  The cloud heaved himself into the air,
throwing the soldiers off balance.  As they toppled over she heard Grappa Gas
shout, "Hold on!"

The last soldier clung desperately to Big Blue as the cloud's flank squished
between his fingers like soggy dough.  The oncoming squirrels jumped at his
legs.  One managed to catch hold of his boot, scramble up the laces, and sink
its teeth into his calf.  The soldier cursed and kicked it off.  With a last
desperate lunge he managed to catch hold of Grappa Gas's hand.

"You idiot!" Grappa Gas yelled as he pulled the soldier up onto Big Blue's back.
"You saints-be-damned *idiot*!  They woulda stripped you down to your bones
faster'n you can peel an apple!  What was so weeping important that you couldn't
just leave it?"  He kicked one of the bundles at his feet.  "Eh?  What was
so---urp!"

In one smooth motion the soldier had rolled onto his feet, stood up, and grabbed
a handful of Grappa Gas's collar.  "With respect, honored, I'm grateful for the
rescue, but that's one of my men you're kicking, and I'll be thanking you to
stop."

He let go of Grappa Gas's coat.  The cloudherd coughed.  "Ah.  Sorry, lad.  I
didn't realize.  I'm sorry."

The soldier nodded.  "Me too."  He looked back at the patch of rock, where the
swarm of squirrels had already torn the tents to pieces.  "Me too."

---

*Earlier that day...*

Noxy and Sensy volunteered to collect spiderwebs that morning---or rather, Noxy
volunteered them both and Sensy went along with it like she always did.  Winter
had finally turned to spring; stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the
shadows of the twisted mountain pines, but the sun shone diamond-bright in a
clear blue sky, and carding camel wool indoors suddenly seemed unbearable.
Besides, getting out of the village would give them a chance for a talk that
Noxy thought was long overdue.

"Shoo."  She poked a fat brown spider with a stick.  It waved its hairy forelegs
at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a new home.  Noxy cut its web's
anchor threads with two practiced twists of her knife and began winding it onto
a stick.

"Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?" Sensy asked.

Noxy glanced at her.  "Why? Are those ones coming loose?"  She had been trying
for an hour to think of a way to broach the subject of their mutual friend Rash,
who was the only boy their age in the village of Stale.

"No, they're just kind of plain." Sensy looked down at her soft brown goofskin
coat critically.  "Granna Fee has some really nice red ones.  She said she'd
give them to me if I picked the stones out of her pepper garden."

"Her whole garden? That would take forever." Noxy shook the dew off the spider's
web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder.  "Why
would you do all that work for buttons you don't need?"

"Oh, you're no help," Sensy pouted.  She had spent the winter embroidering red
and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar.  All she seemed to want to
talk about any more was her clothes, and her hair, and the boys she and Noxy
might meet that summer.  The only thing she *didn't* want to talk about was
Rash.

"A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes," Granna Fee had said
when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who seemed to have taken her
best friend's place.

"Not me!" Noxy had declared.

Her grandmother had laughed.  "No, sweetling, not you."

The three children had grown up together, done chores together, played tag and
make-believe in the forest around Stale together, and learned to mind-speak with
clouds together, but something had changed that winter.  Sometimes Noxy saw
Sensy look at Rash, or Rash look at Sensy, and then look away as if they felt
guilty or were afraid they might blurt out a secret.  Other times they just sat
there not speaking.  If her two best friends were mad at one another, Noxy
thought it was her job go sort it out.

Noxy slung her bag over her shoulder.  "Come on, let's go look for some more."
She set off without waiting for an answer.  A moment later Sensy scrambled to
catch up with her.

The path was one of dozens that snaked through the evergreen forest surrounding
Stale.  Mud made it slippery where it wasn't slick with ice, but Noxy didn't
slow down until she reached the ridge above her home.

Below her lay the ancient walls of the fortress that held the village of Stale.
The centuries had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look
like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as
the mountains themselves.  The villagers' two-story wooden houses sheltered
inside the fortress like ducklings in a nest.  Thin licks of smoke rose from
their slate chimneys, while goof pens, vegetable plots, and racks laden with
drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.

To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.  A net woven
from spider thread stretched over its top, as light as a dream but as strong as
steel.  Another net hung down at the gorge's mouth to make a gate.  Inside, just
visible from the ridge, two gray clouds floated half-asleep.

Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds, riding
them, and, most importantly, practicing mind-speech with them.  Grownups called
Big Blue and Pillow slow and lazy, but they and the herd of half-wild clouds
grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance were the most exciting things in
Noxy's world.

As Noxy pulled her bag off her shoulder, Sensy grabbed her arm.  "Look!"  she
hissed, pointing into the trees.

At first all Noxy saw was branches.  Then a pair of dark eyes blinked, and her
mouth went dry.  Black fur framed a round face with heavy brows and a gray
muzzle.  The troll blinked again and pulled a branch aside with one long, hairy
arm.

Noxy and Sensy took a step back, then another.  A sudden rustling behind them
made them freeze.  With her breath caught in her throat, Noxy looked over her
shoulder.  A second troll hung by one hand from a branch behind them, blocking
their escape.

"Wh-what are they doing here?" Sensy whispered loudly.

"Ssh!" Noxy said.  "Just... don't... move."

Branches rustled overhead.  Two--- three--- four trolls swung by, except no, the
fourth didn't swing by.  It stopped and looked down at them.  Its fur was shot
through with gray, and even from five strides below it Noxy could see the long
red scar that ran up the length of its left leg.

Something twinged in the back of her head like the start of a headache.  She
felt dizzy, and for a moment it was as if *she* was in the tree looking down at
herself.

A sudden roar broke the moment. The troll hooted and vanished into the forest.
Noxy and Sensy each let out a long shaky breath---

---and screamed as a tiger burst out of the trees half a dozen strides in front
of them.  His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes, not orange and black
like the picture in the book that three generations of village children had
passed around.  A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear, and his tail
twitched slightly as he looked at them, as if their presence reminded him that
he had not yet eaten lunch.

"Are you all right?" he rumbled.

"Wh-what?" Noxy stammered.

"Are... you... all... right?" the tiger repeated impatiently.  "Did those
blasted chimpanzees harm you at all?"

"No, they---I mean, we're all right.  We're fine, thank you very much.  Ouch,
Sensy, you're going to break my fingers!"  Noxy pulled her hand free from her
friend's terrified grip.

"Pilots be praised," he rumbled, settling onto his haunches.  "Now, if I may ask
a favor, I am looking for the village of Stale Leftovers.  Would you be so kind
as to direct me?"  His ear twitched at the sound of a distant hoot.  "Or if
perchance you are going that way yourselves, I would be honored to accompany
you.  Those creatures are unlikely to try another attack if you have a
protector."

Noxy hitched her bag up on her shoulder.  "They didn't attack us.  We---I mean,
the village has an arrangement.  With the trolls.  We don't go too far into the
forest, and they don't come near the village except for when they want to trade,
and they leave some stones down by the fish pond to tell us when they want to do
that, and---" She stopped herself and took a deep breath.  "I'm sorry.  Who are
you?"

"I am Kulbinder of Thind," the tiger said, rising to all fours.  "And if you
will forgive my impatience, my need is rather pressing.  My companions are in
danger, and in dire need of rescue.  It may already be too late---I need to
reach Stale Leftovers *now*."

Noxy shot a look at Sensy.  Her friend shook her head slightly and mouthed "no".
That was enough to make up Noxy's mind.

"It's this way," she said, pointing down the path.  "Come on!"

It only took them a few minutes to reach the gap in the fortress wall where an
enormous stone door had once hung.  A few chunks of its shattered remains lay
half-buried in the ground, too big for even a team of sturdy mountain camels to
pull free.  The wooden gate that Stale's human inhabitants had put up to fill
the gap was three planks thick, but still looked like a child's toy set into the
Pilots' ancient work.

Grappa Gas was sitting on one of the stones whittling a new leg when they came
out of the trees.  He raised a hand in hello, then swore and clambered to his
feet at the sight of the tiger.  "Saints and their creations!"  He pointed
accusingly with his whittling knife.  "What in the underhells is this?"

"*This* is a who, not a what," Kulbinder replied curtly, his tail bristling.

"We met him up by the spider grove," Noxy said hurriedly.  "There were some
trolls, and he scared them off.  He says---"

"Trolls?"  Grappa Gas interrupted incredulously.  "Can't be.  They haven't come
down this far in---"

"Grappa!"  Noxy stomped her foot.  "Never mind that now!  The tiger says people
are hurt and need help.  At least, I think they're people," she added.

"They are as human as you are," the tiger said.  "Are you the *tralpa* here, or
the reeve?"

Grappa Gas snorted.  "Not likely, but I can take you to them."

Ten minutes later, the whole village was in the cobbled square---or rather, the
whole village minus most of the adults, who had left a week ago for the
snowfields to collect Stale's clouds from their winter pasture.  Three hundred
people, from babies in their parents' arms to those babies' grandparents, stood
in a half-circle around the impatient tiger.  Some still wore the thick coats
and pants they used in winter and when cloudherding.  Others, like Noxy and
Sensy, had switched to lighter gear that would still seem heavy to anyone
unfamiliar with the icy winds of the high mountains.  Grappa Gas's son Aft, who
had been splitting logs with an ax to make shingles, was the only one in
shirtsleeves, but he wasn't the only one scowling at the new arrival.

Noxy's mother Indy thumped the speaker's drum three times and stepped up onto
the squared-off stone that marked the center of the square.  "Friends," she said
loudly, patting the air with her hands to quiet everyone.  "Friends, please.
Thank you all for coming.  I know it is early in the year for travellers, but
please, give a true mountain welcome to Kulbinder, a Gifted of Thind."

"Welcome... welcome... be welcome..." Some voices were hearty, some grudging,
and some people didn't speak at all, but Noxy's mother took it all in stride,
just as she always did.

Someone nudged Noxy's shoulder with their own.  "Hey," Rash said, slipping
between her and Sensy.  "Where's the *tralpa*?  Is he too afraid of the tiger to
come out and say hello?  Or has he been up all night 'studying' again?"  He
mimed someone drinking from a bottle.

"Ssh!"  But he was right---the king's representative was nowhere to be seen.

Indy thumped the brightly-painted speaker's drum again.  "The Gifted has told me
that he and his companions were trying to get through the pass to Chaghan.  An
avalanche forced them off the road and into the forest."  She swept her gaze
across the assembled villagers.  "The forest got angry.  Some of them have died,
and the rest are trapped.  They need our help."

A murmur ran through the crowd.  The Herd of Trees that blanketed the Brumoso
Mountains wasn't mad like the Jungle of Thind, but it guarded its territory and
privileges as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs.  Gifted creatures who
lived among the trees all did its biding.  People who stayed near the Pilots'
ancient roads never came to harm, and those who ventured deeper were safe as
long as they were careful.  Make a fire too large, though, or wander into one of
the circles of towering redwoods that Granna Fee cautioned Noxy and her friends
to steer clear of on training flights, and the forest's wrath would be as
merciless as a winter storm.

Aft clapped his hands twice, but didn't wait for Indy to call on him.  "Are they
smugglers?" he asked loudly.

Noxy saw rather than heard her mother's exasperated sigh.  "Not that the Gifted
has said, no."

"Then why in the saints' names were they trying to get through the pass this
time of year?  It'll be another month at least before the high trails clear."
He crossed his brawny arms.  "Doesn't seem like something honest folk would do,
is all I'm saying."

"My companions are not 'honest folk'," the tiger said loudly.  "They are
soldiers."

The crowd murmured again.  "Oh, now that's weeping marvelous," Aft said
sarcastically.  "Mind telling us whose side you're on?"

At that, the tiger finally looked at him.  "They have the privilege of serving
the Learned Shudarga."

That brought gasps instead of murmurs.  As a brilliant young scholar, Shudarga
had written pamphlet after pamphlet arguing that Gandan's laws should be free
for all to use.  The kingdom's merchant-nobles had ignored her at first, or made
jokes about her, but when she started organizing peasants and tradesmen, their
laughter turned to anger.  Arrested, she had escaped the previous summer and
raised her flag in rebellion, attracting thousands to her cause, but then winter
had come and news from the lowlands had slowed to a trickle, leaving the
cloudherds with nothing but rumors.

"Does that mean King Denpa's boys are going to come looking for you?"  Grappa
Gas demanded, ignoring Indy's insistent clapping for order.  "Because if they
do, these walls won't keep 'em out for long."

The tiger's tail twitched.  "I did not come to your village for its walls,
honored.  My companions need help, and you are their only hope.  If you are
afraid it will bring more trouble than you can chew, say so and I will be on my
way."

"Nobody is saying we won't help," Indy said firmly.  "And as long as I'm reeve,
nobody is *going* to say that."  She shot a warning glare at Grappa Gas as he
opened his mouth, and a second at Aft to silence him as well.  "We can argue
about the politics later.  Right now, there's folk in trouble, and I won't have
it said that the people of this village ever turned their backs on those that
needed help."

*Clap clap.* Granna Fee waited for Indy to nod at her before speaking. "What
about the *tralpa*?  I expect he's going to have something to say about us
helping rebels."

Indy's smile was as cold as the distant peaks.  "I'll ask him when he wakes up."

---

The next five minutes were chaos.  Out of the question, Grappa Gas said,
whacking his wooden leg with his cane to emphasize his points.  The law might
forgive them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who wandered in out of a storm,
even if they were rebels, but flying off to rescue their friends?

And what would other cloudherds say if they heard that Stale had left people in
the forest to die, Aft shot back.  Pilots and saints, what would their own kin
say when they got back from up the mountain?

The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones.  Little whirlpools of
disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart as people overheard
neighbors they disagreed with, or turned around to agree with something they had
overheard and were sucked into yet another "what if?"

"This is going to go on forever," Noxy said sourly.  "They all know they're
going to do whatever my *amma* want to do in the end---why don't they just get
on with it?"  She, Sensy, and Rash stayed together in a knot on the sidelines,
old enough that they hadn't grown bored and run off to play like the younger
children, but young enough that the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.

Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a mustache.  It had
become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had told him countless times he
ought to break before *someone* broke his stupid finger.  "What I want to know
is whether we're going to get to go, or if we're going to be stuck here with the
littles."

"Of course we'll get to go!" Noxy exclaimed.

"Are you sure?"  Rash raised an eyebrow, another annoying habit he had
cultivated over the winter.

Noxy puffed an annoyed breath, biting off her "of course I'm sure!"  when she
caught Sensy's uncertain look.  "Wait here," she said with a scowl.

She strode through the crowd to the speaker's stone and caught her mother's
eye.  Before Noxy could speak, Indy said, "Oh, and I think you've met my
daughter, Probably Noxious."

"The honor was mine," the tiger rumbled, flicking an ear in what might have been
the feline equivalent of a very small bow.

Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was immediately
annoyed at herself.  Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a silly lowlander custom.
"Just call me Noxy," she told him.  "*Amma*, which cloud do you want me and
Sensy and Rash on?  We can go and start getting them ready while everyone's
still jawing."

Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well.  "Who said anything
about you three going?"

But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and had
assembled her arguments as she crossed the square.  They were definitely old
enough---why, they were all going to be riding *real* clouds in a few weeks, not
just tame old pair floating about in the cloud pen.  And they wouldn't be going
far, just a few gallops down the pass, and it was really important for
cloudherds to know how to do rescues, wasn't it?  And---

"Stop."  Her mother held up a hand, not noticing or just ignoring the looks on
the faces of the villagers who had overheard Noxy's torrent of words.  "You can
go.  But!" she continued, "But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna Fee, and
that's all you do---ride.  Understood?"

Noxy nodded obediently.  "Yes, *amma*."  She had learned long ago not to keep
asking for a whole orange when she'd already talked her mother into a half.

Somehow everyone eventually realized that they agreed with Indy's decision or
that they were so outnumbered as to make further argument pointless.  After
that, it only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed.
Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and more than one tinker
or trader had needed to be lifted out of a difficult spot after running into a
bear or being set upon by trolls.  Coils of hemp rope with spider-silk cores
hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen, and everyone kept an extra
goofskin cap somewhere handy, just in case.

"You look ridiculous," Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the wooden steps
to the mounting platform.  He had stitched what he claimed were eagle's wings
onto the side flaps of his cap.

Rash looked her up and down.  "Really?  Because I think you look amazing.
Excuse me."  He winked at Noxy and stepped around the speechless
thirteen-year-old.

"Ears all!" Aft called out, clapping his hands.  He had changed into heavy pants
and a padded coat and a pair of soft boots, and his hair was pulled back in a
thick club braid with a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven into it
for luck.  "You know how this is done.  I'll lead on Pillow with the younglings
as spotters."  He stabbed his finger at Rash and Sensy.  "Gas and Fee, you've
got Blue and Noxy.  We'll down, lift, and out, quick and simple, and get
everyone back here for soup before you can sneeze.  No adventures, right?"  He
turned a steely glare toward Noxy, Sensy, and Rash, who nodded and mumbled, "No
adventures."

"Right!"  And without anything more than that he walked out to the end of the
plank that stuck out three strides from the platform, looked down to check that
Big Blue was below him, and jumped.

Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath.  One, two, three... Big Blue
dimpled under Aft's weight as the burly cloudherd hit him dead center.  Gray
waves rippled out across the cloud's back as Aft rolled over onto his knees and
pressed his hands down firmly.  Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his
eyes would be closed in concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount.

Something twinged in the back of her head.  She blinked, momentarily
disoriented.  "Did you say something?" she asked Sensy.

"What?"  She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.

"I said---never mind."  Noxy shook her head.  "Look, he's coming up."

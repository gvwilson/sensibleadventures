Razi told me once that stories don't really have beginnings.
"Except the first one," he said as he cut a lime pepper in half
with a sharp little knife he had produced from some hidden pocket in his *deel*.
"The story of the whole world.
It's the only real beginning.
All the rest---hold still."
Ignoring my yelp,
he clamped my forearm against the stone
and pressed the lime pepper against the deep scratches that ran from my elbow almost to my wrist.
"All the rest,
*la*,
there's always something before the start and something before that.
It's like---"

"Stop trying to distract me," I gasped.
Gargoyles are scavengers,
and their claws are filthy.
That meant my wounds would probably fester if he didn't clean them,
but at that particular moment
I preferred the burning sting of the lime pepper juice
to another of his rambling lessons.
If nothing else,
the pain shooting up my arm into the back of my skull
might take my mind off how stupid I had been.

Because gargoyles aren't always scavengers.
Ometimes they develop a taste for fresh meat,
like the chickens the village kept for their eggs.
The young male lying dead on the glass behind us
had figured out how to pry apart the boards on the chickens' coops.
Maybe he just wanted the eggs,
but when the chickens started squawking he killed one
and then another and another.
Their fear woke the whole village.
Babies started crying,
Azra threw up,
and the grown-ups shouted and banged spoons on pots to scare the gargoyle away.

Everyone hoped that would be the end of it,
but he came back the next night and killed again,
and that's when the village center came to speak to Razi.
She didn't say much as they drank their mint tea,
and neither did Razi,
but after she left,
Razi told me to get my bow and the short hunting spear I had made.

Everyone stayed out of sight as I walked home to get my weapons.
I half-hoped my mother would be there,
but killing is taboo.
She had left out some food though---a hard-boiled egg that I ate right away,
some bread,
two of last night's falafels,
and some dates.
And she had put my bow and spear by the door
and hung my father's old sun goggles on them,
which was as close to hugging me as the taboo allowed.

Medef was a fishing village before the Angels turned Lake Karaband into glass.
According to Razi,
the gargoyle's nest was on a little rocky outcrop that used to be an island offshore.
"They were forest creatures before things changed," he told me
as we trudged through the loose sand
where the beach had been a thousand years ago.
"They cannot glide like vultures---*la*,
they must flap their wings to fly,
so he cannot be far."
Then he grinned.
"And also, I saw it land there."
I nodded but didn't reply.
I had never killed anything bigger than a scorpion.
Secretly, I still hoped that maybe,
just maybe,
I wouldn't be able to do this.

- have to mention the sword-hilt bottle earlier
  - when Razi walks to Forecastle (Erileine wonders why he doesn't drink from it)
  - on the *Presumption*
  - by his bed when he's being healed
- if Erileine is sixteen, she's nearly an adult, not a child - make it clear that she's 13
- when the mountain takes off
  - the toy soldiers have been taken down
  - the Hett cheer when the mountain lifts off (they're expecting it)
  - the Avauntois weren't warned
- how do they get the dirt off after their crawl?
- Erileine's hand at the end is what lets her pick up the Pilot Stone
- Erileine uses magic to get rid of the Avauntois' fear of being in tunnels
  - a timeless moment bargaining with something or someone but even that's not right
  - its first request is her legs, which she rejects
  - she gets it down to her ability to play the flute
  - need to work in scenes of Erileine practicing the flute with her father to make it clear what she's giving up
- add a mention of magic books in the Captain's House
  - Erileine has smuggled some magic books out to read but can't make sense of them until after she has done a spell
  - after that, all the allusions start to make sense
  - like the book she read about dancing that Que√ßenne made fun of her for but then relented
  - magic books are accounts of bargains made, but don't say *how*
- on the walk back to Starboard Town she tries to do magic to light a fire
  - she can feel *something*, but it scares her and Piaerre interrupts her ("they'll see us!")
- "light glinting off their metal eyes" - make this clearer
- must be some sign before the end that Razi isn't normal
- describe Thomas's departure after he drops them off
  - Razi disappears for a moment so it isn't a surprise when we discover later that he has stolen the fireflies

## Into the Blight

Noxy hadn't realized how many soldiers were in Apple Bridge until she saw them
all standing at attention in the front courtyard in four ruler-straight rows.
She started counting, but stopped when Mope muttered, "Eighty, plus Sergeant
Ranneda and her two apprentices, and Gemby over there. He's not part of the
troop's regulation fighting strength any more, not since he lost his leg, but he
keeps the horses happy."

The prince stood in front of the troops with Sergeant Gyalpa beside him. He
looked relaxed to Noxy, but if she had been closer, she would have been able to
see that his fingers drumming on the hilt of his sword. His brightly-painted
battle mask could have made him look like a child playing dress-up.  Instead, it
made him look grown-up and determined. The swirls of yellow paint on its cheeks
and the ribbons of rank on his sleeve reminded her of how Sergeant Dorbu had
looked the day he had arrived in Stale.  She blinked away tears.  *This is no
time to be weepy,* she told herself sternly.  They had a princess to rescue.

At a barked, "Reee-*spect!*" from Sergeant Gyalpa, the soldiers straightened up
even further.  Prince Thokmay stepped forward. "You all know where we're going,"
he said loudly, deliberately roughening his voice so that it wouldn't break.
"And you all know why, and what we face. If any of you would rather spend a year
on a galley bench, now's the time to say so." He paused for a heartbeat.  No one
moved.  The only sounds were those of birds scolding each other among the
rafters and two maids arguing about blankets in a room upstairs.  "Very well
then.  Sergeant?"

"Yes, Your Highness!"

The prince pointed at the men standing to his right. "These four squads are with
us. The others will stay here with Sergeant Ranneda."

"Yes, Your Highness," the sergeant replied.  "Reeee-*spect!*" As one, the
soldiers thumped their right fists against their chests and roared "Gandan
preserved!".

The sergeant led those the prince had selected toward the stables, while the
others hurried away in twos and threes to their duties.  The prince walked
across the cobblestone courtyard to Mope and Noxy, raising his battle mask he
did so. He ran his fingers over his short, wiry hair as if to dry it. "How did I
do?" he asked, his voice cracking.

"Well enough, Your Highness," the troll reassured him.  "Your father would be
proud of you. I certainly am," he added quietly.

"Are you sure it's wise to take so few, Your Highness?" a soft voice asked from
behind Noxy, making her jump. Sergeant Ranneda gestured at the men marching
away.  "It is by your sister as we're looking for."

"My father would want me to deal with this like a soldier," the prince replied
evenly.  "Not like a frightened child. Anything could happen if I leave too few
here to guard the town." He studied the magician for a moment. "Are you...?"

Sergeant Ranneda nodded in answer to his unfinished question. "I'm by well
enough, Your Highness. But please, take along with both of my apprentices. I can
handle whatever might happen along by here while you're gone."

"Of course," the prince nodded.  He turned to Noxy. "I'm sorry to run away like
this," he said, his voice breaking.

"Of course," she said. On a sudden impulse she stepped toward him. His eyes
widened. She hesitated for a heartbeat, her sudden courage gone, then punched
his arm gently. "Blue skies and a star to guide you."

--HERE--

It took the prince until the middle of the afternoon to reach the Blight. The
squad at the rear would speed up to gallop past the others, then slow to a trot
once they were in front to let the next squad ride past. The prince tried to
stay calm, and not think about what might be happening to his sister, but every
time he rode past Sergeant Gyalpa he couldn't help but ask, "Anything?" Every
time, the sergeant said, "Nothing, Your Highness."

There were no markers on the edge of the Blight, no walls or signs to show where
the magically-poisoned land began. Prince Thokmay only realized they were in it
when he saw a patch of flowers that had been turned into glass. He turned in his
saddle to stare, then heard a crunching sound underneath him as his horse
stepped on some grass that had been transformed the same way.

"You'll want to watch out for that, Your Highness," Manpa said. "Bucket's hooves
are tough, but they're not so tough that they can't be cut."

"I'll be careful," the prince promised. He looked around. "I haven't seen any
birds for a while."

"Nor you won't, Your Highness. There's not many that'll come here that weren't
born here. Same as the people, like."

The prince nodded. "I can understand why. Come on, let's keep going. It will be
dark soon, and we're still four miles from the hill."

The further they road, the bleaker the land became. Scraggly blackberry bushes
hunched down when they heard the soldiers approaching, while the knee-high grass
had a metallic green sheen, like an summer fly's body, and made a scraping sound
like rusty scissors when the wind brushed over it. The few trees they passed
were stunted, and the apples hanging from them were blackened, or bloated to the
size of pumpkins. Even the sky above them was somehow twisted. It seemed normal
enough when Prince Thokmay looked straight at it, but he kept seeing swirls of
color sweep through it out of the corner of his eye.

They came up over a small rise and saw a wooden 'X' propped up on either side of
the road. Each was tall as a mounted man's head, and the rain had long since
washed away whatever paint might once have been on them.  The prince swallowed
as he rode between them. He knew from the soldiers' stories that these markers
had once stood at the edge of the Blight. Now they were two hours' ride inside
it.

The sun had sunk into the horizon like a rotten peach into mud when one of the
soldiers from the lead squad came galloping back to the prince.  "Your
Highness!" he shouted. "There's men up ahead, lots of 'em. The sergeant says to
go slow."

"Understood," the prince said crisply. "Tell Sergeant Gyalpa that we'll be with
him as quickly as we can." The soldier turned and galloped back the way he'd
come. The prince drew his sword and laid it across his lap. Around him, his
soldiers did the same, making much the same sound as the metal grass had
made. He took a deep breath, held it for a second, then spurred his horse to a
trot.

Prince Thokmay expected to find the smugglers waiting at the top of a hill, or
on the far side of a stream. His teachers had told him over and over again how
important it was to make use of whatever defenses the ground offered. Instead,
they were gathered around the stump of what must have once been an enormous
tree. Eight or nine were mounted on mean-looking horses, while twice that number
with spears and swords were on foot beside them.

The prince reined in his horse next to Sergeant Gyalpa, about a hundred yards
away from the smugglers. "Is that your man Muddh, Your Highness?" the sergeant
asked, pointing to the skinny figure atop the only one of the smugglers' horses
that looked like it had eaten a decent meal in the last month.

"That's him," the prince said. "Do they have bows?"

"Not that I can see, Your Highness. Jinpa! Can you see any archers among them?"
the sergeant called.

The soldier squinted for a moment, then called back, "No, sergeant, not a one."

Sergeant Gyalpa studied the smugglers a moment longer. "I don't like it, Your
Highness," he said. "There's forty of us, all mounted, against two dozen of
them, and most of theirs are on foot. Why are they just waiting for us?"

"There's only one way to find out," the prince said, hoping he sounded braver
than he felt. He started to spur his horse forward, but before he could,
Sergeant Gyalpa backed his own mount into the prince's way.

The sergeant glanced around, then sidled his horse closer to the prince so that
their heads were only a couple of feet apart. "You've not been in a battle
before, have you, Your Highness? Not with a sword in your hands."

The prince shook his head. "No, sergeant. I don't suppose you'd call what
happened at Stale a battle."

The sergeant nodded. "Right, then I'd be grateful if you'd stay close to me,
Your Highness, and hang back if there's any excitement. Your father would have
my ears off if I let you get killed by a bunch of featherless ducks like this
lot."

"Yes, sergeant." The prince cleared his throat. "Shall we?"

The soldiers spread out as they rode forward. They were still about fifty yards
away from the smugglers when Muddh raised his arm. "Hello, hello!" he
called. "So glad you could come."

"I am Thokmay Gandan-o Prince," the prince said loudly, hoping that his voice
wouldn't crack, and that he would be brave if battle came. "I am looking for my
sister, the Princess Ogmin. We fear she has been abducted."

The man on the ground beside Muddh was wagging a finger slowly at the
soldiers. He frowned and tugged at Muddh's pantleg and said something that the
prince couldn't hear.

Muddh straightened up and frowned in turn. "Where are the rest of your troops?"
he asked. "It's such a nice day, I hope they're not cooped up washing dishes." A
few of his men laughed.

"Never mind the dishes," the prince demanded. "Do you know what has become of
Her Highness?"

"Oh, yes, the princess," Muddh called back. "About this tall?" He put his hand
up around his chin, palm flat. "Long hair?"

"What have you done with her?" the prince demanded.

"Oh, nothing, nothing," the smuggler said. "Just given her a haircut."  The men
around him started to laugh. One of them reached over and picked something up
off the stump.

"Looks like... braids, Your Highness," Manpa said, squinting again.

"Yes, they're braids," Muddh said, as though he'd been able to hear the soldier
even though there were fifty yards between them. "Show them what else you have,
Harry."

The smuggler put down the cut-off braids, and held up a roll of blue
ribbon. "You do recognize it, yes, Your Highness? Eighteen, yes, it was eighteen
pence a handspan, wasn't it?" The men around him laughed again, harder.

Sergeant Gyalpa swore under his breath. "We've been tricked, Your Highness," he
said. "They must've known we'd use magic to find the princess."

"Yes, well, it only seemed reasonable," Muddh called. This time the prince was
sure that the smuggler had heard them. "I thought of pulling out her fingernails
too, in case you tried to use clippings instead of hair, but I was sure you'd
keep too a neat a house for that."

"If you've hurt her---" the prince choked.

"Oh no, no, no," the smuggler protested. "*I* would never hurt an innocent
child---not unless I had to, of course. But we don't even *have* the princess,
do we?" He twisted around in his saddle to look at his men. "Do we?"

"No," they said, and "Nawp," and "Uh uh."

"What do you want?" Sergeant Gyalpa asked loudly.

The smile dropped from Muddh's thin face. He spurred his horse forward a few
paces. Prince Thokmay noticed that he was holding his mount's reins in his right
hand, and something else in his lap with his left. "I want you and your troops
to leave Apple Bridge," he said. "By tomorrow. For good."

The prince scowled. "You know we can't do that."

The smuggler beamed. "Of course you can---you're a prince! Well, half a prince
these days, from what I hear, but a prince nonetheless."

"He can't be serious, Your Highness," Sergeant Gyalpa muttered. "Even if we did
leave, the king would have half his army down here before the harvest started."

The prince nodded. "Why should we leave Apple Bridge?" he said in a normal tone
of voice. "If you don't have my sister, what reason would we have?"

"You might do it just to be friendly," Muddh said, then snickered.

The prince shook his head. "I'm sorry, but I don't think I want to have a friend
like you. Even if I did, I couldn't oblige you. Apple Bridge is part of Gandan."

"Not for long," Muddh said lightly. He picked up a small bag that was hanging
from his saddle horn. "Not for very long at all."

"It's magic!" one of the apprentices shouted. "I can feel it!"

"Gandan!" Sergeant Gyalpa bellowed. He dug his heels into his horse.  The
soldiers around him shouted, "Gandan and the dawn!" and charged.

Muddh paused for just a moment, watching them come at him with a satisfied look
on his face. Then he undid the string that held the bag closed and shook it
out. A terrible roaring sound filled the prince's ears as a tornado came
whirling out of the bag.

## Attacked!

The tornado roared into the sky, doubling in size and then doubling and doubling
again as it poured out of Muddh's bag. "At them!"  Sergeant Gyalpa shouted to
the soldiers. "Get in close, or it'll swat you like ladybugs!"

The soldiers charged, shouting "Gandan! Gandan and the dawn!" The smugglers
shouted curses back. The ones on foot braced the ends of their spears against
the ground, so that the soldiers' horses couldn't get close, while the ones who
were riding horses of their own drew their swords and dug their spurs into their
mounts.

"Stay close, Your Highness!" Sergeant Gyalpa ordered the prince. He paused,
watching where men were going, watching where they weren't, then shouted, "Haw!"
and spurred his horse forward. The prince dug his heels into his own mount and
followed him.

The next few seconds were mad confusion. The soldiers had to ride around the
front rank of smugglers to avoid their spears. As they did so, Muddh held up the
copper hoop he'd been holding in his lap and shouted commands at the tornado. It
twisted and danced across the ground, then lashed out like a man kicking a ball.

Instead of a ball, though, it connected with a soldier on horseback. The man's
horse screamed as it was lifted into the sky. The soldier himself dropped out of
the saddle onto the ground. His left leg buckled underneath him as he hit the
ground. Before his comrades could reach him, a smuggler on horseback lunged
forward, leaned over in his saddle, and swung his sword.

An instant later Prince Thokmay saw Manpa and another soldier cut left, then
right, then left again to get in close to the knot of smugglers. Muddh didn't
hesitate. The tornado snatched up the two soldiers and a smuggler as well and
tossed them through the air. They tumbled like dice.

Sergeant Gyalpa stood up in his stirrups and waved his sword over his
head. "Fall back!" he shouted. "Fall back! We can't get past that thing!" He
watched the melee for a moment in despair, then snarled, "They can't hear me!
Your Highness, we have to get you out of here!"

"No!" the prince protested. "I won't run away!"

"And I won't have a dead prince on my scroll!" the sergeant bellowed back. "Now
don't make me carry you on my shoulders!"

"I will *not* run!" the prince shouted. "Haw!" He dug his spurs deep into his
horse's flanks. The frightened animal bounded forward. Behind him, Sergeant
Gyalpa cursed, then kick his own horse into a gallop as well.

Prince Thokmay crouched low over his horse's neck and charged straight at the
smugglers. The wind-blown grit stung his eyes. He felt his horse's hooves
pounding on the ground beneath him. The smugglers were small, small, small, and
then suddenly larger and larger as he dodged behind a startled spearman and
swung. His blade bounced off armor. A spear thrust up past his ear. He ducked
and screamed in fear and anger and swung his sword again---

And suddenly the earth beneath him was churning like the ocean in a storm. His
horse screamed with fear as she lost her footing and stumbled, neighing with
panic as she found her footing again and leaped toward solid ground. The prince
twisted around in his saddle, just in time to see the spearman he'd just passed
sink to his knees in the turbulent earth.

Somehow Sergeant Gyalpa was beside him. "It's that thing!" he shouted.  "The
land---his magic is waking it up! We have to get out of here, *now*!"

"But what about the troops?" the prince shouted back. He suddenly realized he
was crying.

"They're already falling back, Your Highness. Look!" Sure enough, everyone was
fleeing, smugglers and soldiers alike, as the land roiled and heaved like a
living thing.

"Guard my back!" the sergeant ordered the prince. He spun his horse around and
charged at the smugglers. Most of the spearmen were struggling to get to their
feet. As the horsemen around Muddh tried to get their panicky mounts under
control, Sergeant Gyalpa charged through them and swung his sword.

The prince saw the sergeant's blade connect with the copper hoop that Muddh was
still struggling to hold high. There was a flash like lightning.  Muddh and the
sergeant both cried out. The hoop flew through the air. When it hit the ground,
the earth splashed like water. The copper hoop sunk out of sight like a stone
thrown into a murky pond.

The tornado roared in triumph as it felt Muddh's hold over it break. It pounced
on the smugglers like a cat pouncing on a crippled bird, throwing them this way
and that. Prince Thokmay saw Muddh leap from his horse an instant before the
tornado snatched it up. The smuggler scrambled over to the old tree stump and
pulled a man-tall mirror off the wagon that was still somehow parked there. He
propped the thing against the stump and dove through it an instant before the
tornado snatched it up.

The prince shouted, "Look out!" but it was too late. The mirror slammed into
Sergeant Gyalpa like a stone from a catapult, knocking him from his horse.

"No!" the prince screamed. He dug in his heels. "No!" His horse charged forward.

Sergeant Gyalpa tried to stand, but fell again as his knee gave way.  "Go back!"
he shouted to the prince. "Go back!"

"Hang on!" the prince shouted back. He pulled his horse up short beside the
sergeant and half-climbed, half-fell out of the saddle.

"No, Your Highness, you have to save yourself!" the sergeant shouted, pushing
the prince's hands away.

The prince grabbed the sergeant's sleeve and pulled him up onto his good
leg. "I've already lost one sergeant," the prince grunted. "I will *not* lose
another! Now climb up on that horse!"

The prince pushed the sergeant up by the rump while the sergeant pulled himself
up into the saddle. A heartbeat later the prince swung himself up behind
him. "*Now* we can run," he said. He smacked the horse on the rump. The animal
didn't need any encouragement. It galloped heavily away.

Behind them, the tornado picked up Muddh's magic mirror and smashed it to the
ground once again, then whirled off toward Apple Bridge.

## Snow

Prince Thokmay and Sergeant Gyalpa stayed on horseback until they were over the
crest of the hill, where the sergeant reined in Bucket so that the prince could
slide off her back. "She'll never be able to carry both of us, will you, girl?"
the prince said, speaking to Sergeant Gyalpa as much as to the horse. "Eh? Will
you, girl?" he soothed, stroking the horse's neck. The weary animal just
snorted.

The prince patted her one more time, then looked up at his companion.  The
sergeant's jaw was clenched, and his frown showed pain as much as anger. "How is
your leg?" Prince Thokmay asked.

The sergeant straightened up a bit in the saddle. "Still a mess," he said. "I
don't think it's broken, but the knee is in bad shape. Put me up against that
tree over there, and go and get help. I'll be all right."

"I think I'd rather have some company," the prince replied lightly.  "Here,
drink some of this." He passed his half-empty canteen up to the old soldier.

As the sergeant drank, Prince Thokmay looked around. The sky above them was
almost dark, but the land was still lit by a soft glow that came from nowhere
and everywhere at once. On one side, the rocky slope led down to the churning
field they had fled, beyond which was Carmick Hill and the road home. The other
side led down to a narrow valley. A few trees grew near the small stream that
ran along the its bottom.

"D'you hear that?" the sergeant suddenly said. "The wind's dying down."  He
passed the canteen back to the prince, who tucked it into a saddle bag.

"Do you think Muddh put the tornado back in its bag?" the prince asked.

Sergeant Gyalpa snorted. "Not without that thing he was waving around, I'll
wager," he said, satisfaction getting the better of pain in his voice for a
moment. "I just hope the others are all right."

"Me too," the prince said. He patted the horse once more, then put his helmet
back on. "Come on. I think I see a path down there by that stream."

They picked their way down the rocky hillside. It was bigger than it had
seemed---it seemed that the further down they went, the further they had to
go. Prince Thokmay walked in front, while Sergeant Gyalpa rode behind him with
the reins in one hand and his sword laid across his lap.

Neither of them spoke until they reached the floor of the small valley.  The
path turned out to be a narrow dirt road, and the stream to be so wide that some
might have called it a river.

"It's further than I thought," the prince said, looking back the way they had
come.

"It's all like that around here," Sergeant Gyalpa told him. He gestured with his
sword toward a small clump of trees. "Twisted, like them. Something that looks
like it's a hundred yards off can take you all day to get to. Or you can barely
see it, but you ride for five minutes, and there you are. Sergeant Ranneda said
it's something to do with the way magic bends the light, and all." He shook his
head. "I don't pretend to understand it."

"Nor I." The prince pulled the canteen from the saddle bag and gulped the last
of the warm water. "I thought about becoming a magician once, you know," he
suddenly confessed. "After my visit to Stale. I thought that since I'd already
had a taste of it, I might as well make it my life."

"Why'd you decide against it?" the sergeant asked.

The prince shrugged. "When Barramarrabee---His Majesty's chief magician---found
out, he asked me if I really wanted to spend my life giving up things I cared
about." The prince paused for a moment, looking along the length of the
stream. "When he put it that way, I had to wonder. I asked him why anyone would
ever become a magician."

"And what did he say?"

The prince shook his head. "All he said was that some people don't get to make
as many choices as a prince." He shook out the canteen as he spoke, and bent
over the stream.

"Wait! What are you doing?" Sergeant Gyalpa asked sharply.

The prince glanced up. "Filling the canteen," he said. "We're out of water."

"Hold it by the strap," the sergeant ordered. "Don't put your hand in the
stream. Just dip the canteen. Yes, like that."

The prince lowered the canteen into the stream. Fat bubbles escaped from the
mouth for a moment, and then the prince said, "What...?"  The bubbles were
trapped under the surface of the stream, as though there was a thin layer of ice
on top of the water.

He tried to lift the canteen from the water. It wouldn't budge. He lowered it
slightly---it went deeper without any resistance. When he tried to raise it
again, it simply wouldn't come up.

"What's going on?" he asked, suddenly more afraid than he had been during the
battle.

The sergeant scowled. "We're in the Blight, that's what," he said.  "Sometimes a
stream is just a stream, and sometimes it's a live thing that'll pounce on you
like that tiger your brother has, and sometimes..." He pointed at the
canteen. "Sometimes it's greedy."

"I could have put my hand in there," the prince whispered.

"You could have," the sergeant agreed. "But you wouldn't ever have taken it out
again. You'll probably want to stay out from under those as well," he added,
pointing at the trees up ahead. "They might not be as smart as the ones around
Lake Ormadine, but they can be meaner than wolverines."

He winced suddenly as Bucket shifted her weight. "Is there anything we can do
for your leg?" the prince asked, not caring that his voice broke.  "Manpa showed
me how to make a splint."

The sergeant nodded, swallowing another pained grunt. "We'll cut your tent poles
in thirds," he said. "And then we'll follow this stream. I think that way is
east---the Trout's off there somewhere. If we can make it that far, we can get a
raft to take us back up to Apple Bridge."

The prince noticed that the sergeant said 'if', not 'when', but didn't
comment. Instead, he wrestled his pack off Bucket's back, then took a hatchet
from one of the saddle bags. The tent poles did double duty as braces for the
pack. It took him a moment to untie the straps that held them in place, and then
a few moments longer to cut them to length.

That done, he helped Sergeant Gyalpa get down onto the ground. The sergeant had
to lie down on top of Bucket, then swing his good leg over her back and slid
down into Prince Thokmay's arms, trying as he did so to keep his good leg
underneath him. Bucket whinnied, but did not step away, as the sergeant first
sat, and then lay down, on the ground beside her. "Just---just straighten it at
the knee," the sergeant gasped. "Yes, like that. Good jo-aagh. No, no, it's all
right. It's all right. Try again. Use your weight. Urgh. Harder. No, go on, it's
going to hurt either way, you might as well---urrrggh."  Sergeant Gyalpa
clenched his fists so tightly that the prince heard one of the joints crack.

"All right, all right," the sergeant gasped a moment later. "That's straight
enough. Put the poles down beside it. You're going to have to lift m' leg to get
the rope under it. Yes, like that. Now, easy, both hands, just lift---no, no,
both hands on my leg, just drop the rope underneath. Yes. And again. One
more. Uuhhh... All right, now tie it all up. No, tighter than that. Don't worry
about cutting off the blood. No, not like that. Where'd you learn to tie knots?
Just cross it over and---here, let me."

Sergeant Gyalpa had to prop himself up on one elbow in order to sit up. Prince
Thokmay sat back and watched while the sergeant untied and then re-tied the last
knots in the rope that held the splint together. His hands shook, but his grip
was strong.

When it was finally done, he looked up at the prince. "Thanks," he said.  "You
did well."

The prince swallowed. He wanted to lie down in his bed back in Apple Bridge and
sleep for a week, but instead he got to his feet. "Let's get you back up on
Bucket," he said, putting the sergeant's arm around his neck as the older man
struggled up onto his good leg. The sergeant pulled himself up onto Bucket's
back until he was lying on his stomach in the middle of the saddle. Prince
Thokmay helped him swing his good leg over to the other side of the horse, and
then edge forward into the saddle. When it was done, the sergeant was back where
he had been ten minutes before, but with six roughly-cut lengths of wood tied
around his injured leg to hold it straight.

They set off along the narrow road, the prince walking, the sergeant
riding. Their conversation was sparse: "Watch out, that mud will be slippery,"
or "Put those branches on behind me, we can use them for a fire tonight."

The prince guessed that they had covered four or five miles in about two hours
when Sergeant Gyalpa finally said, "All right, we'll camp here for the night."
The little valley had widened and flattened, so that there was twenty yards or
so of level ground on either side of the road.  There was grass, too, and a few
blackberry bushes, and even a patch of reeds in the stream.

"Is it safe to let Bucket graze?" the prince asked once the sergeant was down
out of the saddle.

Sergeant Gyalpa shook his head. "Not here," he replied. "You ought to have some
oats and all in your---yes, good, give her that. Anything she eats from around
here will probably poison her, or turn her into a frog." He tried to smile. "Can
you see me riding on frogback?"

"I can see us both riding on one of Noxy's clouds," the prince said, trying to
match the sergeant's light tone. "It'd be softer than that saddle, and we'd be
so high up that all of this would look like nothing more than a badly-drawn
picture."

The sergeant snorted. "Thanks all the same, but I'll take my chances down here,"
he said. "I know how to fall off a horse, but falling off one of those
things..." He shook his head.

The prince helped the sergeant onto the ground, then pointed at a clump of
blackberry bushes a few yards from the road. "There are some branches over
there. If you can stack the ones we have, I'll get some more. That ought to get
us through the night."

"Yes, Your Highness," the sergeant said.

The prince stopped in his tracks, then turned slowly. The sergeant was looking
at him expressionlessly. "That's the first time you've called me that since the
tornado," the prince said slowly.

"Is it, Your Highness? I'm sorry." The sergeant braced a branch against the
stony ground and leaned on it until it snapped, then set the two pieces on top
of two other, smaller pieces that he had already laid out.  The result looked
like a giant's wooden tic-tac-toe board.

The prince took a deep breath. "I wouldn't mind if you didn't bother highnessing
me, you know."

The sergeant shook his head and broke another branch. "I'm sorry, Your Highness,
but it might be a hard habit to break afterward, and that wouldn't be a good for
the troops."

The prince blinked. "So what's changed from three hours ago?"

The sergeant looked up at him, still without any expression on his face.  "Three
hours ago, I didn't think I'd ever see any of the other troops again to set a
bad example." He broke another branch in two. "Best get that firewood, Your
Highness. I don't think it's going to get dark, but I can feel the cold coming
on."

Prince Thokmay nodded. He had felt the air growing cold as well. He took the
hatchet from Bucket's saddle bag again and walked over to the blackberry
bushes. They rustled slightly as he approached, even though there was no wind.

"Easy, easy," he said softly. Somehow it didn't seem strange in this place to be
talking to a plant. "I'm not here for you. I just want those old scraps of
wood." He gave the bushes a wide berth, and started stacking the dried-up old
sticks in his arms.

He didn't notice the first flake of snow, or the second. It wasn't until one
landed on his cheek that he looked up and realized that the air was full of tiny
dancing white bits of fluff. "But it's the middle of summer," he muttered,
exasperated. "Even here!" He picked up a few more pieces of wood and turned
around.

The snow was falling faster now, so thickly that he could barely make out the
road. The flakes melted as soon as they touched the ground, but the air was
getting colder by the second. "Sergeant!" the prince shouted. "Sergeant, can you
hear me?"

"Yes, Your Highness," the sergeant called. He sounded puzzled. "What's the
problem?"

"I can barely see you," the prince said, his voice breaking. In fact, he
couldn't see the road at all.

"What's wrong, Your Highness? Are you all right?" Prince Thokmay heard the
sergeant grunt as he tried to get up.

"No, wait, stay where you are!" the prince called. He brushed a handful of snow
from his hair. "I just can't see through all this snow."

It wasn't until the sergeant shouted, "What snow, Your Highness?" that Prince
Thokmay felt afraid. He stumbled in the direction that he thought the sergeant's
voice had come from. The snow wasn't melting on the ground any longer.

"Sergeant!" he shouted. "Sergeant, have you got the fire going?"

"Yes, Your Highness! Can you see it?"

"No! Keep talking, I'll try to get to you!"

"But Your Highness, I can see you!" Prince Thokmay had to strain to hear the
sergeant's voice. The falling snow was muffling everything. With a shock, the
prince realized that the hatchet had fallen out of his fingers. They had already
become numb from the cold.

"Tell me which way to walk!" the prince shouted back desperately.  "Hurry!"

"Straight ahead, Your Highness! No, no, left! Left! That's right. That's right,
straight ahead! No, you're turning again!"

"I am not!" the prince shouted back in frustration. "I'm walking in a straight
line!"

"Stay where you are!" the sergeant shouted. "I'll come and get you!"

"No!" The prince paused for a moment. His teeth were chattering.  Suddenly he
had an idea. "Sergeant! Sergeant, can you hear me?"

"Yes, Your Highness!"

"Sergeant, I want you to put out the fire! Right now!" The prince dropped the
armload of wood he was somehow still carrying and took another few steps through
the knee-high snow. He couldn't feel his feet.

"But Your Highness---"

"Right now!" The prince almost screamed.

There was no sound for a moment, then the sergeant shouted, "It's out, Your
Highness. What now?"

"Just keep talking!" the prince shouted, hoping he had guessed right.
"Just... k-k-keep... t-t-t-talking!"

The prince slogged forward another step, and another. Was the snow falling a
little less heavily? He tried not to think about it. He remembered his uncle's
stories about retreating through a blizzard from Ax Medicine during the Anuat
rebellion thirty years before, then tried to push them out of his mind as
well. Most of the other soldiers in his uncle's regiment had never seen
Garheim-in-Garheim again.

But a few heartbeats later there was no doubt: the snow was easing off, and the
air was warming up. Prince Thokmay shouted, "Sergeant? Am I headed the right
way?"

"Yes, Your Highness. No, wait, turn right. Now go ahead. No, turn right again,
and---hold on, Your Highness, stay right where you are."  Something thumped to
the ground a few feet away from the prince a moment later.

"Can you see that?" the sergeant called. It was a saddle bag, with one of the
tent's stay ropes tied to it. The prince stumbled forward and grabbed the
rope. Its other end was knotted to another stay rope that led off through the
snow.

"I've got it!" the prince shouted. He trudged through the snow, holding onto the
rope like a sailor holding a guide rope in a heavy storm.

One moment Prince Thokmay was calf-deep in snow. The next, he was standing on
the road with the rope in his hands. He blinked, then whirled around.  The
tied-together ropes stretched no more than ten yards to the saddle bag, which
sat dumbly on the dry, stony ground. The wood the prince had collected was
tumbled together a few yards from the bag.

"But I---but it was snowing!" the prince mumbled.

"I know," the sergeant said. "You're covered in it. And your hands!  Your
Highness, you're freezing! I'll get the fire---"

"N-N-No!" the prince chattered. "Th-that's what st-st-started it, I think. The
l-l-land was ang-ang-angry about th-the f-fire."

"Well, it didn't react here, Your Highness," the sergeant said firmly.  "And we
have to get you warmed up. Sit down here."

It only took Sergeant Gyalpa a few heartbeats to coax a small spark to life in a
pile of tinder, and another few moments to get it to catch on a small
branch. The prince watched miserably as the fire slowly spread through wood,
which was still smoldering from the fire the sergeant had doused. Feeling slowly
returned to his fingers and toes, and what they mostly felt was painful.

He sniffled and wiped his nose. "I couldn't see anything," he said. "I mean, out
there."

"I couldn't either, Your Highness" the sergeant said. "You were just stumbling
around, it looked like." He frowned. "I wonder...  Sergeant Ranneda said once
that there were safe roads in the Blight. The Pilots built them so that they
could cart stuff in to Fast Lake to dump it. Maybe this is what's left of one of
those."

"S-so are we headed in toward the lake, or out?" the prince asked. His voice
cracked again.

The sergeant shook his head. "I don't know, Your Highness. Direction doesn't
mean a lot in here." He looked up at the starless sky. "I just wonder what's
going to be waiting for us when we get out. Muddh must know he can't hold Apple
Bridge for long, not even with a dozen tornadoes. He must be planning something,
but what?"

"---in' right you shoulda asked. It's *my* ship, dammit." Her foster father's
voice had a whining edge that Iffy associated with messages from debt collection
software and the occasional visit from a burly bearded man with steel teeth who
made sure that gambling debts didn't stay debts for long.

"Nobody has said otherwise," Doctor Johel replied, her "yet" unspoken. "And if
Fifth or Commander Wales had told us the drone was theirs and let us inspect it,
perhaps this could have been avoided."

*Speaker makes gesture indicating helplessness,* a tiny mechanical voice
captioned. Iffy barely noticed. *Commander* Wales?

===

She woke to the rap of armored knuckles on her door. The Marines were polite
enough, but it was clear that they felt Iffy should have left Honesty in their
care. One lifted Honesty, still wrapped in the scratchy blanket that Iffy had
slept under since she was little, and carried her away. The other unzipped a
navy blue duffel bag and briskly transferred the piled armor to it.

"So how bad's th' damage?" Iffy finally asked, her back against the bulkhead and
her knees drawn up under her chin.

The Marine shook his head. "I'm sorry, citizen, that's classified."

"Oh for---I *live* here!" Iffy burst out, exasperated. "That hole where th'
squid thingy blew up---that's dry dock work fer sure. Anythin' else I gotta
start plannin' to fix?"

The Marine paused, one arm in mid-air, as his imprinting and his own personality
arm-wrestled inside his head. "There were casualties," he finally admitted.
"And the *Bengal* took heavy damage. Your assistance would be appreciated."

"Happy t' help," Iffy muttered. Her cabin felt cold and empty without Honesty
and her blanket, and she ought to make sure Aunt Naggie was all right. As the
Marine zipped up the duffel bag, she pulled her coat back on and slipped out the
door.

Aunt Naggie and Johnson Wales were in the pilot house, empty tea mugs at their
elbows. Iffy thought about asking where Uncle Jack was, then realized she
didn't care. "Hey, sleepy head," Wales greeted her as she came in and gave her
foster mother a hug. "How's your friend?"

"Marines took her. I think she's aright." Iffy leaned back against the wall
and nodded at the control panel, where the hole in the deck pulsed scarlet and
dozens of smaller punctures looked like sores with the scabs picked off. "How
bad is it?"

"She'll get us to Paddington," Aunt Naggie said. Her tone said the
rest---unless there was another attack. Unless the sea boiled beneath them or a
storm came up or the sea set any of a hundred other disasters on them.

"What about the Navy ship?" Iffy jerked her head toward the window. "Th'
Marine said they lost some folk an' took damage."

Wales nodded grimly. "Doctor Johel won't tell me how bad it is, which means
it's pretty bad."

===

Neither of the adults noticed her eyes widen as she remembered the moment in her
dream when she had felt the same thing. Before she could think of anything else
to try, lights danced across the tech in Wales' temple. "The *Bengal*'s
surveillance is coming back online," he said quietly, pressing a finger to his
lips.

Iffy nodded again. There could be no more discussion. "Lemme know if there's
anythin' I can do t' help with repairs," she said.

Aunt Naggie gave her a hug. "We'll be a'right," she said, her face pressed
against the stubble on Iffy's scalp. "We'll be a'right." Iffy hugged her
back and fled before her tears could show.

She made her way back to her cabin, not knowing where else to go. What had just
happened? Why hadn't she been able to speak. She put a tentative hand on her
head and then snatched it away, feeling foolish. She had never noticed any
bumps or scars before---why would she now that she knew she had tech in her
head?

Her cabin felt cold and empty without Honesty. She kicked off her boots and
threw herself onto her mattress still wearing her coat. After staring angrily
at the ceiling for a few seconds, she picked up her nature book and turned to
the page she had wondered about most ever since she was old enough to read
without a prompter murmuring in her ear to help. It showed a forest, but
calling it that was like calling the ocean wet. The trunks of the trees were so
thick that the *Guinevere*'s pilot house could have fit into them, and their
branches reached higher than any building Iffy had ever seen. The caption read,
"Cathedral Grove," and beside it someone had written, "Why does everything have
to end???"

Iffy ran her fingers over the picture, hoping to see a *Corvus caurinus* fly
through or an *Odocoileus hemionus* peek out from the bushes, but the image
lay still. There were no crows or deer for her today. She wondered if there
were any anywhere. The forest was long gone, she knew that, but maybe some
of the crows had survived. Maybe they'd been able to fly away when the fires
came, or when people grew desperate enough to cut down the last of those ancient
giants. Crows were supposed to be smart---smarter than gulls, maybe even
as smart as rats, and rats were practically everywhere.

Hugging the book to her chest with one hand, she ran the fingers of the other
lightly over her temple. Lots of people had implants of one kind or another,
just like practically everybody had at least a couple of gene tweaks if you
cared enough to look for them, but finding out still felt strange. And being
able to see machinery the way cores did---

She set the book aside, put her hands under her head, and closed her eyes. It
was a kind of like a super-power, and people with super-powers in sims had
adventures. Whatever else might happen, she and Honesty were going to have an
adventure. *And Aunt Naggie,* she added, *And Wales. And maybe even Jeep,*
because why not? Maybe they would find out one by one that they each had some
special gift, and that fate had brought them together to save the world.

She rolled over onto her side. Moments later, quiet snores filled her cabin.

## Chapter 8

Paddington South was as dirty as Rothera was smelly. A century after the
Zillion raids that had finally put an end to the strip-ming, the mulchers that
had ground cubic kilometers of coal-rich rock into gravel stood at the shore
like giants, waiting for ships that would never come again. All that remained
was the dust---the black, finely-powdered dust that made everything feel
slightly greasy and made everyone unfortunate enough to live wheeze slightly
with every breath.

Uncle Jack emerged from his cabin long enough to bring the *Guinevere* alongside
a pier and tie her up, then disappeared again, muttering a ceaseless
half-coherent litany of curses and grudges. He didn't speak to Aunt Naggie or
Iffy, and they didn't speak to him. What was there to say? Iffy packed her
nature book and her clothes and tools in a single duffel bag and waited on deck
until Aunt Naggie appeared with a duffel of her own hitched over one shoulder.
"No point wasting it," she said to Iffy, nodding at the pots and pans and spices
in the two-wheeled grocery cart she pulled behind her.

Johnson Wales had already loaded his toolboxes onto the back of the little
three-wheeled truck that was to take them into town. Four Marines stood beside
it, their armor still showing scars from the attack. Honesty wasn't among
them---all Wales had been able to find out for Iffy was that she was healing
well, but still being kept asleep. Iffy had recorded half a dozen messages for
her and deleted each one before sending a brief note back to Rothera to tell her
First and Second that their Third was all right. She had no idea if or when it
would reach them, but it was all she could do.

She climbed into the back of the truck and sat next to her foster mother. Aunt
Naggie put an arm around her. "All set?" she asked.

Iffy looked at the wounded ship that was no longer their home. "Let's go."

Wales thumped the side of the truck. "Sure thing, boss!" its little core said
happily. The truck lurched forward, nearly dumping Iffy off her bench. With
two Marine in front and two behind, they headed into town. A second truck fell
in behind them, its passengers hidden beneath a canvas roof.

Iffy tried to ignore the stares and scowls of the people they passed. Everyone
and everything was grimy: the faces, the windows, even the solar panels. Twice
her nose caught the familiar hot stench of coal being burned in an illicit
furnace. It was wrong, she knew, but each time they rounded a corner and the
wind scraped its icy fingernails across her face, she wondered if she would have
the strength to turn down a little warmth.

"Those poor dears," Aunt Naggie said as a pair of children who had been kicking
a bedraggled ball back and forth picked it up and disappeared into an alley.
"They don' look like they've had a decent meal in forever." Wales grunted but
said nothing. Iffy snuggled closer to her foster mother and wished that the
little truck would go faster.

They rounded a final corner and entered another world. Foamed glass, blue and
white, swooped and curved like waves on the ocean behind them. Drones no bigger
than Iffy's hand circled above the building like a flock of birds from her
nature book, so beautiful that it took her a moment to realize that each one
carried a single-shot laser capable of drilling a small hole through a
centimeter of Navy-grade armor or a meter of concrete. She couldn't see any
greenhouses, or robotic sentries like the ones that had guarded the governor's
mansion in Rothera, but she didn't doubt for a moment that the two-story folly
in front of her was more than capable of defending itself.

The truck slowed and stopped. "This must be the place!" it said cheerfully.
It waited while they dismounted and unloaded their gear, then backed up, swung
around, and trundled back toward the docks, whistling a happy little tune made
slightly sinister by the grime and decay in front of it.

The second truck pulled up. A Marine helped Doctor Johel out of the back.
"Mustn't dawdle," she said, waving them forward. "He's waiting for us inside."

*Who's "he"?* Iffy wondered, but when Wales and Aunt Naggie didn't ask, she just
picked up the third of Wales' toolboxes and followed them. Gravel crunched
under feet, and somewhere in the distance she could hear the slow *whoop whoop
whoop* of windmills, but that was all. The constant shush and murmur of the
ocean seemed a long way away.

Through a pair of double doors that opened on their own, along a short corridor,
and they were in a waiting room that looked like a hasty pencil sketch of the
one in the mansion in Rothera. The couch was just as comfortable, but
steel-gray instead of ochre and green. The potted plants were so symmetrical
that Iffy knew they had to be real---no one would ever print something that
obviously fake. As for the music, it was just as soothing and unplaceable.

A soft knock, and the door opposite the entrance opened. "Well, that was
exciting, wasn't it?" the governor said pleasantly as he stepped into the room.
Tall, slightly stooped but still strong, wearing a formal turtleneck two shades
darker than the one he'd had on in Rothera---it had to be a hologram, Iffy
though wildly, or some sort of telepresence bot dressed up to look like the
governor in violation of common politeness and a dozen laws.

But when he shook her hand, his felt like meat and bone. "Doctor Johel tells me
things could have gone very badly out there if not for you," he said. "Your
friend has already been moved to the Navy hospital here in town, and the core
tells me she's expected to make a full recovery."

"Thank you," she mumbled. "I 'preciate it."

He gave her hand a final firm squeeze before turning to Wales and Doctor Johel.
"Unfortunately, the other news isn't as pleasant," he continued briskly. "The
attack was definitely Zillion, but the core believes some faction of China's
hypermind may have assisted them. We've tried reaching out through the usual
channels, but all we've had back so far is a poem about the necessity of entropy
and how time is an arrow, not a circle."

"If China is involved, does that mean you're scrubbing the mission?" Wales
asked, his voice carefully neutral.

The governor smiled. "On the contrary. We leave in seventeen hours."

Doctor Johel raised an eyebrow. "We?"

The governor's smile grew even warmer. "Absolutely," he said, looking at Wales.
"I wouldn't miss it for the world."

There was a shower in the basement, and a seemingly endless flow of hot water
that didn't smell of the sea. Iffy and Aunt Naggie squabbled for a moment about
who needed it more before the Marine who was their guide and guard cleared his
throat and pointed out that there were actually *two* showers. The towels were
the thickest and fluffiest Iffy had ever seen, and the freshly-printed
sweatshirt and leggins waiting for her when she was done fit her perfectly.

The Marine led them back upstairs to a dining room as big as the *Guinevere*.
The curved glass overhead gave the sky a warm blue tint. In the distance Iffy
could see the razor-edged ridges of Mount Klenova, scraped and carved over
millions of years by the sheet of ice that had finally been defeated by a
warming planet. Smaller peaks---smaller only by comparison---stood in ranks
beside it, each decorated by a faint plume of wind-blown snow.

Doctor Johel and the governor were already seated. Wales stood beside his chair
until Iffy and Aunt Naggie reached them. "Better?" he asked.

"Tons," Iffy said gratefully. Her new sweatshirt was as warm as the towels had
been, and not scratchy at all. It was almost certainly recording her pulse and
temperature and a dozen other things and sending them to the mansion's core for
analysis, but at that particular moment, she didn't care.

She plopped herself down on the chair that Wales pulled back for her. Aunt
Naggie did the same, and then the blocky 'Merican seated himself. The governor
and Doctor Johel ended their murmured conversation, and for a moment everyone
sat silently and expectantly.

"I wonder---" "How'd you---" Doctor Johel and Iffy both stopped. "Go ahead,"
Doctor Johel urged politely.

Iffy shook her head. "'S not important. I was just---how'd you get here so
quick?" she asked the governor.

He smiled his usual smile. "A good question. Not one the core will let answer,
I'm afraid---security. But if you can guess...?"

"Hovercraft," Wales offered. "One of the old Ericas, probably, with a
wide-field skirt so you wouldn't kick up a snow trace. It probably took you
half as long and twice the fuel." His smile was as warm as the governor's and
just as false. "And I'll bet that's how you're planning to get to the base---I
don't imagine the core would be happy with you stuck on a train. What do I
win?"

"Lunch, of course," the governor said lightly as a trolley rolled toward them on
silent wheels bearing trays of sweet and sour soup, grilled tofu, roasted
vegetables, sliced mangoes, and tea. The adults made appreciative noises and
Iffy's stomach rumbled as the trolley gave each of their plates an unnecessary
polish with a clean white cloth, laid out chopsticks with geometric precision,
and began serving the food.

The governor, Wales, and Doctor Johel made smalltalk as they ate. Iffy and her
foster mother focused on the food, exchanging glances now and again to confirm
that yes, this was really happening and no, neither of them had any idea what to
say.

Politics and reminiscences and jokes with edges as sharp as the ridges on the
distant mountains slowly mellowed as the main course gave way to ride pudding
and more tea. "You're really set on making the trip?" Wales asked, settling
back in his chair.

"Absolutely," the governor confirmed. "The core thinks there's a fifty-eight
percent chance that you're right about the base, but a ninety-something percent
chance that the Zillions will try to stop you. Or China. Or possibly both,
which would be *really* interesting." He smiled as if the prospect of being
ambushed by fanatics or a super-intelligence made up of millions of human and
artificial minds networked together was on par with the release of a new chapter
in his favorite sim.

Wales chuckled. "Is the prospect of a third century really that dismal?"

The governor looked out the window. "I've had a good run," he said quietly, and
for the first time Iffy thought she was hearing what he really thought. "I can
remember when there were still a few penguins left, and we still thought we
could turn enough of the bedrock into soil to jump-start a real ecosystem." He
shook his head. "It's time someone else was sitting at my desk, someone who
isn't always thinking of what might have been."

Conversation turned to lighter matters after that: a salvage expedition that had
recently returned from the sunken ruins of Melbourne, shifts in the currents
around the Peninsula, a scandal involving a sim studio in Halley. Between the
warmth, the food, and the dullness, Iffy found it harder and harder to keep her
eyes open.

Finally the governor set his napkin down on the table. "We should probably call
it a night---you'll all want some sleep before you get under way." He nodded at
the Marines who had been standing silently by the door throughout the meal.
"They'll show you to your rooms."

"Your room" for Iffy and Aunt Naggie turned out to be the size of the
*Guinevere*'s forward hold. It smelled of flowers instead of jellyfish, and
while the window wasn't real, the mattress and blankets were.

Iffy stripped to her underwear and slid into her bed with a grateful sigh. Aunt
Naggie sat gingerly on the edge beside her and took her foster daughter's hand.

"What's wrong?" Iffy asked, instantly wary.

Aunt Naggie shook her head. "I ain't comin' with you. The doctor said," she
plowed on as Iffy opened her mouth to protest. "An' she's right. You got
your..." She hesitated. "You got your skills 'n' all, an' this'll be a big
thing for you, but I'd just be weight."

"You wou'nt jus' be nothin'!" Iffy said firmly, sitting up.

Aunt Naggie shook her head again. "That ain't true an' you know it. An' there
ain't no point arguin', and you know that too." She squeezed Iffy's hand.
"You'll be fine. You been waitin' for somethin' like this your whole life an'
now it's here. You'll be fine."

Iffy let out a shaky breath and settled back into her bed. "Will you do
somethin' for me?" she asked after a moment had passed.

"'Course I will." Aunt Naggie gently stroked her foster daughter's head with a
rough hand, then wiped her eyes with the other.

"Will you sit with Honesty a bit while I'm gone? I know the doctors are lookin'
out for her, but..."

Aunt Naggie squeezed her hand again. "'Course I will," she repeated. She
leaned forward and kissed Iffy's forehead. "Now you get some sleep. I don't
figure there'll be much time for it once you're on your way."

*She dreamed, knowing that she was dreaming. "No again," she sighed, rolling
over on her too-comfortable mattress. Two meters away, soundless cartoon zzzz's
rose into the air and evaporated above Aunt Naggie's head.*

*You did not give Johnson Wales our message," the trolley scolded. "It is
important he understands that we know what he is trying to do. We will not
allow him to---"*

*"__We__ decided that we would not allow her to divert him." Honesty scowled at
the trolley.*

*The trolley brandished a pair of chopsticks and a serving ladel. "But our
simulations are complete. The risk is too great."*

*"The risk __to us__," Honesty conceded. "But we are not the only concern, or
even the largest."*

*"Hey!" Iffy sat up and pointed at Honesty angrily. "Stop it. You don't get to
be her, aright?"*

*Uncle Jack gestured at his stained shirt. "Do you want us to be this instead?"*

*"What I __want__ is fer you t' get outta my head! An' fer you t' fix whatever
you did t' me so as I can't talk."*

*Uncle Jack shrugged apologietically. "A necessary precaution. Any information
you share about our conversation might necessitate fresh simulations, and we are
running out of time."*

*Iffy threw herself back down on the bed and closed her eyes. "Well, I'm
runnin' out o' time too, y'know. It's practic'ly tomorrow already. I gotta get
some sleep."*

*The trolley rolled back and forth in agitation. "You see? Even now, they only
think about trivialities. They will make poor decisions, and we will suffer the
consequences. Have we forgotten Bharati?"*

*Uncle Jack---or whatever had been Honesty and was now Uncle Jack---shook his
head. "We have not. Bharati was a serious miscalculation."*

*"Precisely! Simulation or no simulation, we must not allow them to---"*

"Iffy! Iffy, wake up! Oh girl, are y'aright?"

Iffy swam up out of darkness to find herself wrapped in Aunt Naggie's arms.
"Wuzza?" she mumbled.

"You were yellin' at folk in yer sleep." Aunt Naggie let out a shaky breath.
"In all kinds o' different voices. An' you were shakin' like, like I dunnot
what."

Iffy sniffled. "I'm aright." She'd been dreaming, she knew that, but it was
already tangled and fading. She was supposed to tell somebody something, or
warn them, or---she shook her head.

"What is it?" Aunt Naggie asked.

Iffy gave her a last squeeze and wriggled free of her embrace. "Nothin'.
Thanks fer takin' care of me. I mean, all of it," she continued awkwardly,
"Not jus' right now. You been a good mum."

Aunt Naggie smiled at her. "You been a good kid."

They slept, eventually. If Iffy had any more dreams, she didn't remember them
either.

The door chimed to wake them. "Breakfast will be served on board," it
announced, "But there are tea and naan in the dining room if you would like
some."

The tea was very good. The naan was better, and the goopy, chunky orange
sweetness that one of their Marine escorts told them was called "marmalade" was
a revelation. "I'm sure there will be some on the train," he said when Iffy
picked up one of the small jars.

"It ain't fer me." She handed it to Aunt Naggie. "Will you give this t'Honesty
when she wakes up? An' tell her---" She took a deep breath. "Tell her I'll be
thinkin' about her."

Every goodbye hug is either too long or too short. Theirs felt like it was
both. When it was done and they had both wiped their eyes, Aunt Naggie let one
of the Marines lead her away. Iffy followed the other down a corridor, around a
corner, and through a heavy steel blast door that her special ability instantly
told her had been salvaged from a pre-war Russian cruiser and was laced with
conductive carbon nanofibers capable of shrugging off a plasma blast from
anything smaller than an orbital cannon.

The truck that waited for her was smaller and more serious than the one that had
picked them up the day before. She and the Marine sat side by side under a
canvas cover, neither speaking, as it took them around the outskirts of
Paddington South to the train station. It was little more than a four-story
shed with reinforced walls, half a dozen cranes of various ages and
descriptions, and a single heated room lined with shelves as crowded as those in
Mr. Mishra's shop. Gunsights and surveying lasers, a pair of lemon-yellow boots
that reached to Iffy's armpits, foamed glass boxes full of gears and screws and
wire, all carefully labelled---she suddenly felt homesick, and wondered if
Mr. Mishra and the Sandhus had heard about the attack on the *Guinevere* and
what they would think when they found out that she and Aunt Naggie had finally
left Uncle Jack.

"Where's e'ryone else?" she asked.

The Marine checked his data feed with a blink. "They are on their way,
citizen---two minutes until arrival."

"An' where's the train?" She gestured at the empty rails. "It ain't much of a
train station without a train."

He blinked again. "I apologize, citizen, but that information is still
classified. Please make yourself comfortable."

Wishing she had taken a second jar of marmalade, Iffy pulled a crate plastered
with faded biohazard stickers closer to the wall and sat on it.

Two minutes later a reconnaisance drone zipped into the train station. A trio
of trucks arrived a few moments later, bringing with them the bustle and noise
of people getting ready for a journey. Marines unloaded boxes and machinery,
the little motors in the joints of their exoskeletons whining occasionally as
they picked up something heavy. Iffy wasn't surprised to see Doctor Johel climb
out of one of the trucks. What made her gasp was the heavy exoskeleton she had
on. "Won't be much use without it," the old woman said, patting it with an
armored hand. Wireframes took shape behind Iffy's eyes to show how the exo's
bulky boots could unfold to act as snowshoes and the six different kinds of
destruction housed in its comically bulky forearms and hunched back.

Johnson Wales was the last person off the trucks. He nodded to Iffy and handed
her a toolbox, then tucked a mango into her coat pocket with a wink. "Thanks,"
she said. "But where's th' train?"

The concrete beneath her boots rumbled in answer. Wales muttered something
under his breath. "You might want to step back," he said more loudly to Iffy.

The rumbling intensified. Slowly, like a ship sinking in reverse, a blunt-nosed
locomotive rose into the gap between the station's two platforms from its
underground resting place. As soon as it rolled forward a second car rose
behind it, then a third, and finally a second locomotive.

Iffy watched open-mouthed until the rumbling stopped and the Marines hurried
forward to begin loading equipment. "Because someone thought they'd be harder
to detect if they were hidden under ten meters of bedrock," he said sourly.
"Didn't occur to them that if you drive two hundred meters of train into a
fifty-meter shed, detecting them isn't really a problem."

Rice in cubical cartons and beans in square-sided bags. Ammunition in a variety
of shapes and sizes, and weapons that could make use of each one. A power cell
that took four Marines to lift. A collapsible surgical theater and a freezer
container marked "Organs". A single bulky pack for each Marine, extras for
Doctor Johel, Wales, and Iffy---the train cars swallowed it all. Once it was
stowed, a pair of Marines scrambled onto the roof of each car, one at the front,
one at the rear, and clipped themselves on with safety lines. A moment later
their armor blurred and silvered to match the metal tone of the train.

"All aboard," Wales said lightly. Iffy nodded. She hadn't been afraid before,
but she was now.

The door hissed shut behind her. Inside, the car wasn't nearly as fancy as the
one from *Murder on the Transantarctic Express*. The chairs sat on swiveling
bases and were padded to cushion passengers against acceleration. There was a
toilet stall at one end, a little kitchen at the other, and right in the middle,
Doctor Johel with her visor up and one arm free from her bulky exoskeleton so
that she could sip tea from a travel mug with the old British flag on its side.

"Acceleration in thirty seconds," the train said. Iffy and Wales took seats
behind Doctor Johel's and buckled themselves in. "Fifteen seconds. Laser
de-icing enabled. Plume suppression enabled. Ten seconds. Nine, eight..." *I
should have gone to the toilet*, Iffy realized, and then the voice said, "Two,
one, acceleration," and a giant hand pressed her softly back into her seat as
the train shot forward, picking up speed with every meter.

She had expected it to rumble and shake. She had expected she would have
trouble breathing, like characters in sims about rocket launches, but it was
nothing like that. Instead, it was quiet, smooth, and a little disappointing.
Then she looked out the window and her disappointment evaporated. They were
going *fast*, faster than she'd ever gone in her life. Snow-covered cairns of
ground rock shot past the window, growing larger by the second as Paddington
South disappeared behind them until eventually they merged into long, sinuous
ridges. She gasped as the train dove into a tunnel and almost instantly
re-emerged.

"Is this what flyin's like?" she asked Wales, awed by their speed. "Or goin'
into space?"

He smiled, his eyes on the landscape. "Pretty close. Look, there's the
*Scranton*. And the *Brule*." He pointed at a pair of distant dark shapes that
Iffy had taken for more mining waste. The window obediently zoomed in to show
two hulking machines, each one big enough to use the *Bengal* and the
*Guinevere* as bath toys. Snow had piled up against their enormous treads and
on their decks, and they were surrounded by debris from the explosions that had
crippled them during the final days of the war, but even in ruin, they sent a
chill up Iffy's spine. Something... She shook her head. She was supposed to
tell someone something, but she couldn't remember who or what...

"Would either of you like some tea?" Doctor Johel asked, breaking into Iffy's
troubled thoughts. She took a sip from her antique travel mug and gestured with
it at the little kitchen. "It will probably be the last decent brew you get for
a while."

Wales declined, so Iffy did as well, but she did make belated and grateful use
of the toilet. When she returned, Wales and Doctor Johel were studying a
wireframe of a building complex. Rooms and stairways and elevators flickered in
and out of existence as the core mixed and juggled plans for other satellite
ground stations and records of various military research labs to sketch what
they might find when they reached their destination.

Doctor Johel finally waved it away and closed her eyes to nap. Iffy had no idea
how she could sleep sitting up, especially sitting up inside an exoskeleton, but
as her face relaxed and she started to snore, Iffy realized once again just how
old she was and how tired she must be.

"Here," Wales said, bringing up some more schematics. "Have a look at these."
An angular dragonfly the size of her head rotated and flew apart to show
cameras, antennas, a nuclear battery the size of her thumb that could last ten
thousand years, and all around it, the shimmering flow of the software that
brought it all to life.

Wales froze the display and tapped an unremarkable orange lozenge. "That's our
way in, if it's still there." He sat back and studied the sparkling lines that
spiralled out from the subroutine he had selected.

"Why woul'n't it be?" Iffy asked.

Wales shrugged. "They could have been hacked during the war. Or someone might
have pressed the panic button to kill ground control so that they couldn't be.
A lot can happen in a hundred years." He looked out at the pulverized waste on
either side of them and repeated, "A lot can happen."

The track didn't run all the way to Mount Tyree. Instead, the train slowed,
slowed, and stopped on the floor of a broad valley. Twenty kilometers away, the
mountain's peak thrust up proudly above its neighbors. Iffy zipped herself into
an ecosuit that smelled freshly printed and followed Doctor Johel and Wales out
onto the snowfield.

The icy wind whistled in her earphones as she helped the Marines unpack and
assemble their snow scooters. It felt good to be useful, even if the ecosuit's
padded gloves made her hands clumsy.

----


"An' what if we decide we'd rather not stick around?"
Uncle Jack demanded,
belligerent once again now that the danger had passed.
"You gonna put *surveillance* on us t' make sure we stay put?"

Iffy gulped.
Computer cores had watched people every moment of every day for years
in the run-up to their rebellion.
Humanity had designed them to do that,
and had come close to extinction as a result.
Children learned that surveillance was evil
at the same as they were potty trained.
Accusing someone of doing it was a lot even by Uncle Jack's standards.

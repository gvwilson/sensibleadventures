A battered band of rebel soldiers arrive in Stale seeking shelter.
The cloudherds haven't taken sides in the fighting, but they
reluctantly decide that they can't turn wounded men away.

A few days later, the rebellion's commander arrives in Stale.  She
says she wants the cloudherds to carry her army to safety, since they
are losing the war, but the cloudherds discover that she secretly
plans to have them take the army back to the capital to launch a
surprise attack.  As Noxy prepares to flee to warn the other
cloudherds, Thokmay's secret is revealed---and hers as well.

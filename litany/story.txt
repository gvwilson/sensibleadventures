# And Should I Fall Behind
# Greg Wilson

*"They're coming," the younger warned,
eyes closed in concentration as he stretched his eldritch senses to their limits.*

*"Oh really?" the older snapped.
He shifted his alien black sword to his left hand and drew his blaster with his right.
It only had a dozen charges left,
and who knew how effective it would be against the half-dimensional horrors pursuing them,
but its weight was comforting.*

*Not for the first time,
he wished his brother was just a little less smart.
Just a little.
Just less-smart enough to not be able to piece together
the strangely-cold shards of a map made when the sun was still yellow
and–*

"Spoiler."
Robbie struggled to sit up.
"That's a spoiler.
We don't know how old the map is yet, do we?"

"Um…"
George flipped back a couple of pages and nodded.
"Okay, good catch.
That'll be easy to fix–it's just a bit of pencil work.
You want to keep going?"
He carefully didn't glance at his brother as he asked.

Robbie settled back on the bed that had been his home for the last two months.
He claimed he didn't notice the drip tube stuck in his arm any more,
but whenever George came to visit,
it always seemed to catch the corner of his eye.
It,
and the quiet machine it was connected to,
and the faint under-smell of sweat and antiseptic
that reminded him of their mother's final illness in the same room
twenty years before.

"'Sokay if we take a break?"
Robbie yawned.
He gestured at the laptop waiting on the bed tray in his lap.
"I want to take another run at the congestion algorithms."

"Sure.
I'm supposed to get home soon anyway,"
his brother lied.
He slipped the loose pages he'd drawn that morning back into his folder and stood up.
"You need anything?"

Robbie shook his head,
already opening the laptop.
"I'm good.
Say hi to Boots for me."

"'Course.
She'll come by on the weekend."
George hesitated,
just as he always did when the time came to leave.
They had never been a hugging family,
but the one time he and Robbie had bumped fists,
they had both burst out laughing at how ridiculous it felt.
As far as George could remember,
that was the last time either of them had laughed.
"You sure you'll be okay?"

Robbie looked up from the dense tangle of simulation statistics on his screen.
"You mean, am I going to have another episode?
No idea.
But I'm recording my screen and the router is dumping all my traffic off site,
so if I do,
maybe it'll help the doctor figure out what's happening.
You know,
when I'm not actually me."
And then he smiled their mother's smile,
the smile that meant,
"I love you but I'd like to get back to work now."

George closed the door gently behind him,
went downstairs,
and slumped into an overstuffed blue chair that had been
one of Robbie's few additions to the decor.
He closed his eyes and waited for the tears to come.
When they finished,
he wiped his eyes on his sleeve and got shakily to his feet.
Six pages a day was a punishing pace,
but this was one deadline he wasn't going to miss.

The quiet clatter of dishes in the kitchen made him change direction
from the front door to the back.
He knocked gently on the door frame.
"Hey."

The nurse looked up.
A slim middle-aged woman with an Asian face and a Boston accent,
she had come in every day since Robbie started losing hours.
A pot of tea sat steeping on the table next to a tray of overcooked pasta and oxycodone.
She would sit with him to make sure he ate it all,
then take care of what the agency euphemistically called "close personal care".
George had spoken to her so many times now that he was too embarrassed to ask her name.

"Good morning," she said,
setting her book aside.
"How are you doing?"

George shrugged.
"'M all right.
He's working.
Seems to be himself."

The nurse nodded and stood.
"Good.
He said they've moved the launch date back again.
It's…"
She hesitated,
trying to find words.

George's jaw tightened.
"It's well after he'll be gone.
I know."

He rode the streetcar home,
east from the university annex where he and Robbie had grown up
to a neighborhood of gentrified two-story homes
with big front windows and small back yards
where children played street hockey while parents compared notes on renovations and schools.
Two slices of Saran-wrapped pizza and a note saying "Eat this or else! - Boots"
were waiting for him on a stool in front of the coat closet.
He took them and his folder upstairs to the spare bedroom that doubled as his studio,
taped down a fresh page,
and picked up his pencil.

*They called it a palace,
but the Sareeav hadn't been anything like human,
and no one knew what purpose their enormous serpentine structures had served,
or how they had survived for aeons under the ice.
That was the real reason they had come:
not the alien treasures that would buy them an army to avenge their parents and reclaim the throne,
but the chance to reclaim some long-forgotten knowledge
and fill a void in the world's memory of itself.
The craving to understand had drawn the younger brother into one perilous misadventure after another.
For all that he complained,
the older couldn't imagine any other life.*

*Not that it looked like he had much life left to imagine.
An adult flying polyp could devour the minds of an entire city in a single night–even
the Mi-go feared them,
and the Mi-go feared nothing.
There was little comfort in knowing that the freshly-hatched larvae pursuing them
would take weeks or months to suck their souls dry.
"You just had to see what was behind that bloody door, didn't you?"
the older brother panted.*

*The younger brother smiled a smile that meant,
"I'll make this up to you later but right now we have work to do."
The chip of jade set in his forehead was glowing,
and faint shadows cast by nothing mere eyes could see
danced on either side of him.*

"George?"
He straightened at the sound of his voice and rolled his head to work the kinks out of his neck.

"Upstairs,"
he called.
Suddenly aware of the hours that had passed,
he pulled open his desk drawer,
swept the uneaten pizza into it,
and closed it again just as the door opened behind him.

His wife crossed the room and kissed the bald spot on the top of his head.
"How's he doing?"

"He's dying," George replied.
Then he sighed and wrapped his arms around her.
"Sorry, love.
You knew that."

"I know."
She pulled him up out of his chair to hug him.
"Was he all there this time?"

George nodded.
"Seemed to be.
We went through the pages I did yesterday."
His shaky laugh was muffled by his wife's hair.
"Kinda nice that he's taking an interest.
I just wish…"
This time he didn't have to wait for the tears to come.

## Episode 1: 

Once up on a time,
in a world halfway between yours and mine,
lived a young santa named Finner.
They came from a long line of santas and elves:
their mother made her first wind-up singing wombat
when she was not much bigger than a wombat herself,
while their father had started helping with deliveries
as soon as he was reliably out of diapers.<sup>
There's a story behind the word "reliably" in that sentence,
but it's best told some other time.
</sup>

Now,
Finner enjoyed elfing:
the smell of solder,
the *shick shick* of freshly-sharpened scissors,
and the pride they felt when the two halves of a dovetail joint fit perfectly together.
But sitting in a workshop made them restless.
Their mother suggested running up and down three flights of stairs over and over
to burn off the energy:
it just made them sweaty.
They tried sitting cross-legged on the floor with their eyes closed
while they hummed softly to themselves like the monks of Lotse Nuffin.<sup>
The monks were their father's favorite clients.
Every year he took them nothing,
and every year they said it was exactly what they wanted.

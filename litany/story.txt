# And Should I Fall Behind
# Greg Wilson

*"They're coming," the younger warned,
eyes closed in concentration as he stretched his eldritch senses to their limits.*

*"Oh really?" the older snapped.
He shifted his alien black sword to his left hand and drew his blaster with his right.
It only had a dozen charges left,
and who knew how effective it would be against the half-dimensional horrors pursuing them,
but its weight was comforting.*

*Not for the first time,
he wished his brother was just a little less smart.
Just a little.
Just less-smart enough to not be able to piece together
the strangely-cold shards of a map made when the sun was still yellow
and–*

"Spoiler."
Robbie struggled to sit up.
"That's a spoiler.
We don't know how old the map is yet, do we?"

"Um…"
George flipped back a couple of pages and nodded.
"Okay, good catch.
That'll be easy to fix–it's just a bit of pencil work.
You want to keep going?"
He carefully didn't glance at his brother as he asked.

Robbie settled back on the bed that had been his home for the last two months.
He claimed he didn't notice the drip tube stuck in his arm any more,
but whenever George came to visit,
it always seemed to catch the corner of his eye.
It,
and the quiet machine it was connected to,
and the faint under-smell of sweat and antiseptic
that reminded him of their mother's final illness in the same room
fifteen years before.

"'Sokay if we take a break?"
Robbie yawned.
He gestured at the laptop waiting on the bed tray in his lap.
"I want to take another run at the congestion algorithm.
It ought to be okay once there's a couple of hundred satellites in the network,
but there's lots of ways things could lock up before then."

"Sure.
I'm supposed to get home soon anyway,"
his brother lied.
He slipped the loose pages he'd drawn that morning back into his folder and stood up.
"You need anything?"

Robbie shook his head,
already opening the laptop.
"I'm good.
Say hi to Boots for me."

"'Course.
She'll come by on the weekend."
George hesitated,
just as he always did when the time came to leave.
They had never been a hugging family,
but the one time he and Robbie had bumped fists,
they had both burst out laughing at how ridiculous it felt.
As far as George could remember,
that was the last time either of them had laughed.
"You sure you'll be okay?"

Robbie looked up from the dense tangle of simulation statistics on his screen.
"You mean, am I going to have another episode?
No idea.
But I'm recording my screen and the router is dumping all my traffic off site,
so if I do,
maybe it'll help the doctor figure out what's happening.
You know,
when I'm not actually me."
And then he smiled their mother's smile,
the smile that meant,
"I love you but I'd like to get back to work now."

George closed the door gently behind him,
went downstairs,
and slumped into an overstuffed blue chair that had been
one of Robbie's few additions to the decor.
He closed his eyes and waited for the tears to come.
When they finished,
he wiped his eyes on his sleeve and got shakily to his feet.
Six pages a day was a punishing pace,
but this was one deadline he wasn't going to miss.

The quiet clatter of dishes in the kitchen made him change direction
from the front door to the back.
He knocked gently on the door frame.
"Hey."

The nurse looked up.
A slim middle-aged woman with an Asian face and a Boston accent,
she had come in every day since Robbie started losing hours.
A pot of tea sat steeping on the table next to a tray of overcooked pasta and oxycodone.
She would sit with him to make sure he ate it all,
then take care of what the agency euphemistically called "close personal care".
George had spoken to her so many times now that he was too embarrassed to ask her name.

"Good morning," she said,
setting her book aside.
It was one of his mother's,
he noticed,
erudite and speculative and about as approachable as the progressive rock his brother listened to.
"How are you doing?"

George shrugged.
"'M all right.
He's working.
Seems to be himself."

The nurse nodded and stood.
"Good.
He said they've moved the launch date back again.
It's…"
She hesitated,
trying to find words.

George's jaw tightened.
"It's well after he'll be gone.
I know."

He rode the streetcar home,
east from the university annex where he and Robbie had grown up
to a neighborhood of gentrified two-story homes
with big front windows and small back yards
where children played street hockey while parents compared notes on renovations and schools.
Two slices of Saran-wrapped pizza and a note saying "Eat this or else! - Boots"
were waiting for him on a stool in front of the coat closet.
He took them and his folder upstairs to the spare bedroom that doubled as his studio,
taped down a fresh page,
and picked up his pencil.

*They called it a palace,
but the Sareeav hadn't been anything like human,
and no one knew what purpose their enormous serpentine structures had served,
or how they had survived for aeons under the ice.
That was the real reason the brothers had come:
not the alien treasures that would buy them an army to avenge their parents and take back the throne,
but the chance to reclaim some long-forgotten knowledge
and fill a void in the world's memory of itself.
The craving to understand had drawn the younger brother into one perilous misadventure after another.
For all that he complained,
the older couldn't imagine any other life.*

*Not that it looked like he had much life left to imagine.
An adult flying polyp could devour the minds of an entire city in a single night–even
the Mi-go feared them,
and the Mi-go feared nothing.
Knowing that the freshly-hatched larvae pursuing them
would take weeks or months to suck their souls dry
was little comfort.
"You just had to see what was behind that bloody door, didn't you?"
the older brother panted.*

*The younger brother smiled a smile that meant,
"I'll make this up to you later but right now we have work to do."
The chip of soul jade set in his forehead was glowing,
and faint shadows cast by nothing mere eyes could see
writhed on either side of him.*

"George?"
He straightened at the sound of his voice and rolled his head to work the kinks out of his neck.

"Upstairs,"
he called.
Suddenly aware of the hours that had passed,
he pulled open his desk drawer,
swept the uneaten pizza into it,
and closed it again just as the door opened behind him.

His wife crossed the room and kissed the bald spot on the top of his head.
"How's he doing?"

"He's dying," George replied.
Then he sighed and wrapped his arms around her.
"Sorry, love.
You knew that."

"I know."
She pulled him up out of his chair to hug him.
"Was he all there this time?"

George nodded.
"Seemed to be.
We went through the pages I did yesterday."
His shaky laugh was muffled by his wife's hair.
"Kinda nice that he's taking an interest.
I just wish…"
This time he didn't fight the tears when they came.

The next morning was chilly-damp rather than bone-freezing cold.
The city had only seen one real snowstorm that winter,
and as much as he enjoyed his face not hurting when he went outside,
George missed the season.
The only painting he had kept from his twenties was of the elm in his mother's backyard,
bare branches blanketed with white.
The tree was gone now too,
cut down after the arborist told them it couldn't be saved.
Someone had told him there were fewer than a hundred left in the whole city.
He had thought about tracking them down and sketching them,
but graphic novels paid better,
even the ones that weren't tied to video games.

The nurse met him at the door.
"He's not himself right now," she said without preamble,.
"You might want to give him some time before going up there."

George hung his coat and took the deck of cards from its pocket.
"I'd give him all the time in the world if I could.
Excuse me."

She maneuvered to put herself between him and the stairs.
"I don't think–"
She cut herself off as he slipped past her to take the steps two at a time.

Robbie didn't look up when George knocked on the door frame.
"Hello."

"Hi,"
George said as casually as he could.
It wasn't unusual for his brother to lose himself in his work,
but "hello"?
When had he ever said "hello"?

The silence stretched.
"Still trying to fix the congestion whatsit?"
George asked.

Robbie shook his head,
his eyes fixed on his laptop's screen.
"That proved to be an interesting challenge.
I sent the solution to the team last night.
I expect it will take them some time to understand,
so I am using the time to do some research."

"Ah."
George drew the deck of cards from his pocket and riffled them.
"Would you be up for some poker instead?"

At that, Robbie finally looked up.
"Poker.
Yes, thank you, I would enjoy that."
He set his laptop on the table beside his bed.
"The usual stakes?"

George hesitated.
"I don't think you're going to be washing the dishes any time soon."

Robbie's smile looked exactly like it always had,
except for not touching his eyes.
"But you can."

They played a dozen hands.
Robbie folded five times and won the other seven.
"I'm going to quit while I'm behind,"
George said after his brother laid down another pair of queens.

Robbie nodded.
"Thank you for the game."

"Sure."
George looked at the rail-thin figure lying in the bed,
certain now that whoever he was talking to,
it wasn't the brother he had grown up with.
"'Sokay if I check in later?"

"Of course,"
Robbie said,
already reaching for his laptop.
"It's always a pleasure to see you."

The nurse was waiting at the bottom of the stairs.
"I'm sorry," she said quietly.

George thrust his hands into his pockets and studied her coldly.
"Thanks.
Have you ever seen-I mean,
have any of your other patients ever…?"

The nurse shook her head,
fingering the green-gray stone hanging on a simple silver chain around her neck.
She dropped her hand when she noticed him looking at it.
"I've only ever read about it.
I'm sure it'll pass."

"Thanks,"
George said again,
dragging his eyes away from her necklace.
His mother had kept a stone carved with the same odd five-pointed shape on her desk,
and he'd seen the pattern in some of her books as well.
He had started to doodle it once at the dinner table,
but she had stopped him.
"I'm going to run a few errands–I'll be back around dinner time."

He shrugged his arms into his coat on his way out the door,
pulled his phone from the inside pocket,
and opened his contact list.
It had been fifteen years,
and the man George needed to speak to had been old even then,
but he still answered on the second ring.
"That coffee shop still there?"
he asked half way through George's third sentence.

"Yeah, but–"

"Half an hour."
He hung up without waiting for George to answer.

Doctor Biczo had leathered with age.
What little hair he'd had when George first met him was gone–even his eyebrows
had finally given up.
But his eyes were still a piercing blue,
and his grip was as strong as an eagle's when he shook George's hand.
"Sorry about Robbie,"
he said without preamble,
seating himself across from George
and setting the cup of dime store coffee he'd brought with him on the rickety table.

"Thanks."
George sipped his own over-priced mug of mostly foam,
suddenly unsure where to start.
"He's doing okay, I guess.
The cancer's…"
He shrugged.
"He didn't want to do chemo,
not after what Mom went through,
so we're just trying to keep him comfortable and stop him from losing weight too fast and…"
He shrugged again.

Doctor Biczo waited patiently for him to go on,
just as he had when he interviewed George and Robbie during their mother's illness
on behalf of whatever unspecified government agency he doctored for.
"He's not himself sometimes."
George cupped his hands around his mug to warm them.
"Like Mom was,
so I was wondering if you ever found out–I mean,
is this some kind of genetic thing?"

The old man shook his head.
"I don't think so.
At least, nobody ever told me it was.
How often does it happen?"

"Almost every day,"
George confessed reluctantly.
Another patient silence stretched and broke.
"I know you must be retired by now,
but I was wondering if you could come by and,
I dunno,
talk to him and…"
He shrugged again,
unsure what he was really asking for
beyond a grownup to tell him that everything was going to be all right.

Doctor Biczo snorted.
"You're in luck.
Turns out retired isn't really a thing these days.
Sure,
let's go talk to him."
He drained his coffee in one long swallow and stood.

"Uh, now?"
George hastily gulped a too-hot mouthful of his own coffee and stood as well,
wishing as he'd known he would that he hadn't started whatever he had apparently just started.

The doctor's ten-year-old BMW smelled faintly of cigarettes and leather,
even though the seats were covered in cordura
and George was pretty sure Biczo didn't smoke.
They drove four blocks in silence and parked on the street two houses down from Robbie's,
even though the drive was empty.
George waited while the doctor tested the car's doors to make sure they were really locked,
wondering why someone who cared so much about his ride wouldn't have fixed the scratches on the trunk,
then followed him into the house.

The nurse came down the stairs to meet them as they came through the door.
"I wasn't expecting you back so soon,"
she said,
obviously flustered as she tucked a book under her arm.

George jerked his head at Doctor Biczo.
"Just wanted to get a second opinion on Robbie.
Is he awake?"

"Yes, but I don't think he–"
The nurse stopped abruptly
as Doctor Biczo finished hanging his coat and turned around.
She moved aside to clear the stairs,
her eyes downcast.
"I'm sure he'll be happy to see you."

George had a moment of *deja vu* as the three of them trudged up the stairs.
He and Doctor Biczo had climbed those same stairs together fifteen years ago
each time the old man came to examine George's mother.
"He's a specialist," the oncologist had explained uncomfortably the first time.
*I thought you were the specialist,*
George had thought,
but he had kept the thought to himself.
Not Robbie–he had demanded an explanation when they were shut out of their mother's room
during Doctor Biczo's visits,
and then slammed his bedroom door and thrown himself into yet another programming project
when none was forthcoming.

"Robbie?
It's Doctor Biczo."
The doctor didn't wait for an answer before entering.

"I'll wait here,"
the nurse volunteered.

George nodded,
then blinked.
"Is that what I think it is?"
The book under her arm was one of his old D&D manuals.

She glanced down and blushed.
"Sorry, I was just–"
She held it out to him.

"No, no, that's fine."
The corner of his mouth quirked upward.
He knew exactly what it felt like to have someone notice that you were reading "that stuff",
as his mother had indulgently called it.
When he pointed out that the pictures weren't all that different
from those in the esoteric old texts she favored,
she had laughed and declared a truce.

Robbie was awake.
More importantly,
he was himself–the non-expression from earlier had been replaced
by something weary but human.
"You mean, other than dying?" he asked rhetorically
in answer to a question from Doctor Biczo that George hadn't heard.
"Better than I thought I would.
Of course, I've got some help."
He tapped the drip line in his arm with a fingertip.

"And your episodes?"
Doctor Biczo asked.

Robbie settled back against his cushions.
"Straight into it, eh?"
the doctor said gently.

"Like you helped Mom?"
He glanced accusingly at George.
"You terrified her."

Doctor Biczo took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.
"I'm sorry for that.
But honestly,
it wasn't me she was frightened of.
It was her dreams.
Or visions, if you want to be pedantic about it."

"Oh, by all means, let's pedant,"
Robbie muttered.

The doctor replaced his glasses.
"You've been having visions too, haven't you?"

The moment balanced, then Robbie let out his breath and nodded jerkily.
"Yeah."

Doctor Biczo nodded in return.
"Tell me about them."

Robbie shrugged.
"It's like the stuff George draws.
Or a really high-end videogame.
It's a desert,
but the rocks all look sculpted–all pillars and arches and shapes like half-melted statues."

"A desert?"
Doctor Biczo frowned.
"That's a new one."

"I know, right?"
Robbie nodded at his laptop.
"I've been doing some searches,
and most people talk about giant ferns and black stone towers.
And they say the sun is brighter than usual,
but in my dreams it's orange.
The only thing that's the same is the questions."

"Most people?" "Questions?" George and Doctor Biczo asked at the same time.

Robbie answered his brother first.
"Yeah.
Turns out Mom wasn't the only one this happened to.
There have been a bunch of cases.
The first one I've found was a professor named Peaslee just before the First World War–Mom
had some of his son's books.
And there was another prof back in the fifties,
and a couple of other people."
He locked eyes with Doctor Biczo.
"And all of them belonged to that same weird cult Mom joined."

George's heart sank.
"Come on, not this again.
Mom was never–"

"Mom was never a believer because she didn't have to believe.
She *knew*."
Robbie's hands tightened into fists.
"Didn't she?"

Doctor Biczo shook his head.
"I don't know what your mother knew or didn't know.
I wish I did.
Now,
what about these questions?"

Robbie snorted.
"That's the funny bit.
When this started, they were all about the network code I'm writing.
That's why it didn't bother me.
I just figured–sometimes I really get into what I'm working on.
I thought this was just…"

He trailed off.
George swallowed,
but it didn't make the lump in his throat go away.
The two weeks his brother had spent in hospital after his teenage breakdown hung there in the room,
one more ghost in a house that didn't seem to be able to ever let anything go.

Doctor Biczo waited for Robbie to collect himself.
"When it started,"
he prompted.

"Yeah."
Robbie smiled weakly.
"But now all they want to know about is George's stories."
He forced a laugh.
"You're famous in my dreams, bro."

Doctor Biczo raised an eyebrow at George.
The older brother raised his hands.
"Don't look at me.
They're his dreams."
The absurdity of what he had just said struck him and he snickered.
Robbie and Doctor Biczo joined in,
the tension of the moment gone like winter's ice in the spring.

"You said 'they' want to know,"
the doctor asked,
serious once again.
"Who are 'they'?"

"I don't know," Robbie confessed.
"I never see them.
I see other people, though.
It's like something out of a movie.
Most of them are human,
but some are,
you know,
alien humans,
and some are just…aliens."
He looked into a distance that wasn't there in the room.
"I think we're all going somewhere.
A caravan, maybe, or a pilgrimage."

Doctor Biczo nodded.
"Thank you, Robbie.
And thank you,"
he added,
turning to George and putting out his hand.

"Sure,"
George said, shaking it.
"Is this–do you think this is whatever Mom had?"

Doctor Biczo shook his head.
"I don't know what this is," he confessed.
He glanced at a visibly-tired Robbie.
"I'll give you two a moment."

George closed the door quietly after the doctor left.
"I'm sorry,"
he said.
"I should have asked you before calling him."

"'Sokay," Robbie mumbled,
his eyes closed.
"I was prob'ly going to if you didn't."

"Really?"

Robbie yawned.
"Yeah."
He opened his eyes.
"You think this is this some kind of subconscious thing?
Me remembering Mom being like this,
and wanting to go wherever she went?"

"I thought you didn't believe in the subconscious,"
George replied,
blinking at the sudden wet warmth in his eyes,
but his brother was already asleep.

Downstairs a moment later,
George shook Doctor Biczo's hand again
while the nurse hovered in the background.
"So should I be worried?"

The doctor shook his head.
"I have no idea.
But I'm sure it's nothing to worry about."

"Thanks,"
George said,
not believing a word.

*"Stop!"
The brothers whirled around at the rasp of–*

*"Wait!"
The brothers whirled around as a desert-roughened voice rasped behind them.
The old man that stood–*

*A bent figure emerged from a shadowed doorway in the rock behind them,
a staff in its–*

*–from a shadowed doorway in the wall behind them.
The dust mask that obscured its face–

*–from a shadowed doorway behind them
and drew aside the keffiyeh that obscured her face.
Her orange-yellow eyes gleamed almost as brightly
as the chip of soul jade in her forehead.
"Mother!?" the brothers gasped in unison.*

George tore the page from his roughing pad,
crumpled it up,
and tossed it over his shoulder.
The cats had long since lost interest in playing with
the evidence of his writer's block.
*"Mother"? Really?*
He reached for his coffee,
remembered that he had finished it an hour ago,
and rolled his head to try to get the knots in his neck to click.

Paper rustled on the floor behind him.
"Going well?"
Boots' hand came down gently on his shoulder.

He put his own hand on top of it and leaned back against her.
"I'm about to start reading ads for website designers."

"Ouch."
Her other hand set a fresh cup of coffee on his work table
and picked up the stale one.
"Is Robbie okay?"

"Yeah.
I mean, he's still dying, but…"
George sighed.
"I did something I shouldn't have."
He picked up a red pencil and started to doodle blunt five-pointed stars
on a fresh sheet of roughing paper.

After a moment,
his wife squeezed his shoulders.
"Stop that.
Whatever it is,
I'm sure he's forgotten about it by now."

"I doubt it."
George tore the sheet of doodles off the pad,
swearing as the page tore.
"Why can't shit just work?"

"Because it's shit,"
Boots said,
just as she always did.
She squeezed his shoulders a little less gently than before.
"If you're that upset,
just go and see him.
I'll get some studying done, and then when you get home…"

"Mm hm?"

She put her lips to his ear and whispered,
"We can have hot chocolate and watch some *Cowboy Bebop*."

It took him half an hour to get out the door.
For the first time in a long time,
the gray Canadian winter didn't bother him.
Even the headlines playing in the streetcar's windows couldn't burst his mood.

But the trio of black SUVs on the street outside the house could.
His phone bleebled as he approached
to warn him that he was entering an active law enforcement zone
and could be subject to fines, imprisonment, or both if he didn't–

He didn't.
"What's happened?
What's wrong?"
he demanded,
his heart pounding.

The impassive middle-aged man blocking the front gate shook his head.
"I'm sorry, sir, I need you to keep moving."

"Like hell!
This is my brother's house.
Is he–Doctor Biczo!
Doctor Biczo,
what's going on?"

The doctor's expression as he came down the front steps was apologetic but resolute.
"I'm sorry, George."

"What?
Who–wait, what are you doing?"
The front door had opened again.
Two men guided a self-propelled stretcher through it and down the stairs.
Robbie lay on it,
unconscious under a silvery space blanket,
his drip tube still in his arm.

"Jesus suffering fuck!" George exploded.
"Doctor Biczo,
what the hell are you doing?
You can't move him!"

"I'm sorry, George,"
the doctor repeated.
"But we really need to talk to your brother.
He'll be fine, I promise."

"You *promise?*"
The rage that George had been bottling up for the last two months boiled over.
His clumsy punch caught the doctor on the jaw.
"Fuck you, you don't get to–"

A strong arm wrapped around him.
Something cold and sharp pricked his neck,
and then darkness fell.

His first thought took a while to form.
*I'm awake.*
His second was,
*I'm going to feel pretty stupid in a minute.*

That minute passed,
or maybe it was an aeon of travelling near lightspeed
as a disembodied brain suspended in gel.
Then his vision cleared and his tongue was his tongue again
instead of some random slab of unchewed meat
taking up space in his mouth.
He swallowed,
rubbed his eyes with a clumsy hand,
and sat up.

He was lying on a hospital bed.
One pillow,
a light blanket the same institutional white as the sheets,
a plastic scoop-backed chair so featureless it looked like a drawing,
a single square light panel set into the ceiling,
and a small window with a view of a brown brick wall.
There was nothing he could use as a weapon,
nothing he could hurt himself with,
just the faint smell of antiseptic cleaner and despair.
For one fleeting moment he wondered if he was caught in some horror movie revenge fantasy.
Robbie had spent time in a room like this after his breakdown.
Was this some sort of elaborate horror-movie revenge?

The thought was so ridiculous that it washed away the last effects of
whatever drug they had used on him.
He fingered the bruise on his neck,
worried for a moment that it might look like a hickie
and how would he explain *that* to Boots?

He got to his feet
and padded across the cold tile floor to the window in his socks.
No matter how he craned his neck,
all he could see was the brick wall.
But the light felt like morning,
not late afternoon.
How long had he been here?

He turned as the door opened.
The man who had been outside the house came in first,
his winter coat replaced by a dress shirt and tie.
A woman in scrubs followed him,
then another beefy man pushing a stainless steel cart loaded with medical equipment,
and then finally Doctor Biczo.
"I'm sorry, George," he said.
"But we need to ask you some more questions."

He struggled,
but the two men were stronger and had obviously had lots of practice.
The woman in scrubs swabbed his arm and gave him the injection
without once looking at his face.
He shouted and swore,
knowing it wouldn't do any good,
and then the part of him that was him floated free,
giddy and unconcerned
while the part of him that belonged to the world slumped in the chair
and mumbled answers to questions, questions, questions.
What was Robbie working on?
What we he *really* working on?
When had his episodes started?
What did he talk about when he wasn't himself?
Had George ever had episodes like that?

His "no" earned an exchange of looks between Doctor Biczo and the woman in scrubs,
followed by a second injection.
No,
he'd never had any episodes like that.
No,
he didn't know why Robbie had been running searches for old D&D manuals,
or why he was re-reading George's graphic novels
and the illustrated adventures of Conan the Barbarian
and Leigh Brackett and Jack Vance and–

"You've got it wrong,"
George said unsteadily as he came back to himself.
His tongue felt like a slab of meat again,
and his eyes were raw
as if he'd just pulled an all-nighter.
"He was never interested in that stuff.
He only ever played D&D 'cause I wanted to."

"He seems interested now,"
Doctor Biczo mused.
"Or someone does."

George straightened up.
"What have you done with him?"

"He's all right."
Doctor Biczo nodded at the woman in scrubs,
who began packing up her cart.
"We're just asking him some questions."

"It's not fair,"
George said,
weary and hopeless and angry.
"He doesn't have much time left."

Doctor Biczo snorted.
"Have you looked at the world recently?
None of us have much time left.
But these idiots still think they can stop it…"
he added under his breath.

George's hands bunched into fists as a thought struck him.
"Did you do this to Mom?
When she was sick?"

The look on Doctor Biczo's face gave him his answer.
"You shitbag.
I going to fucking kill you.
Why are you doing this to us?"

As if in answer,
the door swung open.
"Because they are afraid," Robbie said,
one arm over the shoulder of the nurse who had been tending him at home.
He gestured weakly.
With no more warning than that,
Doctor Biczo,
the woman in scrubs,
and the two guards toppled over unconscious.

George got to his feet unsteadily.
"Hello,"
Robbie said.
"We haven't been properly introduced, but perhaps that can wait."

The "hospital" turned out to be a four-story office block,
completed but empty.
George supported Robbie while the nurse hurried on ahead.
They passed a handful of other unconscious bodies on their way out,
but no signs of violence.

The nurse drove them away in a compact electric car
with an on-call tag hanging from the mirror.
George sat up front with the nurse while Robbie curled up in the back,
his lungs laboring with the effort of their escape.
After a few blocks of silence,
the nurse said,
"Well, if we're going to do introductions, I'm Aphra.  Call me Affie."

"That's an unusual name,"
George said,
immediately feeling awkward.

The nurse smile.
"My mother named me after her best friend.
She *was* pretty unusual."

"Mm."
George twisted around in his seat to look at Robbie.
"Someone's going to come looking for us, you know."

"Probably,"
his brother agreed.
"This interference is inconvenient."

"Inconvenient?
Robbie,
you could have *died*!
I mean,
look at you,
you're exhausted and you haven't had your meds and–"

"He's not actually Robbie right now,"
Aphra-call-me-Affie said,
gentle and brisk in the way everyone who deals with grief learns to be.
"Your brother has been blessed with the presence of one of the Great Race."

She filled in the details as she navigated through early morning traffic.
Something deep in the past
that looked like it belonged in one of George's old D&D manuals
had swapped minds with Robbie.
"So you're a Yith?"
George asked disbelievingly,
remembering the word from one of his mother's books.

Robbie replied to Affie instead of to George.
"Will this cause difficulties?"

"Not compared to what you did back there,"
Affie said.
"And he *is* the author of the stories."

"What do you mean, back there?"
George demanded.
"Shit, did you kill them?"

"No,"
Affie said coldly.
"That's never been their way, or ours, despite what the government tells itself."

"Will this cause difficulties?"
Robbie repeated,
slowly levering himself up into a sitting position.

The nurse glanced at him in the rearview mirror,
then at George.
Her expression softened.
"The Litany teaches us that this is just one age of many,
and a short one at that,
and that we're going to end it ourselves."

"How?" George asked.

Affie nodded out the window at the unseasonally warm winter.
"We have the dubious distinction of being the only race in the Litany to destroy itself.
And if that was all there was to know about us,
the Yith might never have bothered with us.
Except we come back.
Ages and ages from now,
after the Ck'chk'ck and the Sareeav,
after the earth has been frozen for an aeon,
we come back."

"How?" George repeated.

"That is unknown to us,"
Robbie said.
"There is an age of machines.
They have reason and purpose,
but not minds,
so we cannot know them.
They warm the earth and then fill it with all manner of creatures,
including humans.
By the time the people of the water wake from their long frozen sleep,
the machines are gone again."

"What's that got to do with Robbie?"
George asked helplessly.
Then it hit him.
"They're his machines, aren't they?
The satellites he's been working on."

Robbie shook his head.
"No.
Your technology is still too primitive.
We believe the machines' progenitors are created five centuries hence.
But the network starts here,
and so do the stories."
He blinked slowly,
like someone washing dishes for the first time.
"There are dragons,
and flying ships,
and giant spiders,
and ray guns.
All of them seem to be taken directly from the stories of this era.
We do not understand how that is possble."

The distaste in Robbie's voice when he said "ray guns"
almost made George giggle.
Whoever or whatever this was in his brother's body,
it clearly didn't like mysteries.
"So what–Robbie!"

His brother slumped sideways.
For a heart-stopping moment George thought he was dead,
but then his eyes fluttered and opened.
He sat up once again,
his face drawn with pain,
and started to cough.
"Hey."

"Welcome back,"
the nurse said.
"How're you feeling?"

"I've been better," Robbie admitted weakly.
"Can you please take me home?"

The nurse nodded.
"Of course.
But you know they'll come for you.
They always do."

"Let them come,"
the dying man said wearily.
"There's not much more they can do."

Back at the house,
Affie helped George get Robbie inside,
then said she was leaving.
"The agency will find you someone else,"
she promised.

George just nodded.
He had called Boots,
apologized for his overnight disappearance,
promised to explain everything,
and told her he loved her.
Now,
as the nurse left,
it was just him and Robbie,
alone with each other as they had been fifteen years ago.

Robbie spoke first.
"Something for you in the air vent,"
he said,
gesturing at their old hiding place.

George unscrewed the panel and took out a shoebox
with "SECRET!" written on top in felt marker.
Inside was a strange crystalline machine
that looked like a camera turned inside out.

He passed it to Robbie.
"One of Mom's art projects?"

Robbie shook his head.
"It's something they made.
Or had her make.
It gave me some ideas."
He laughed weakly.
"It's funny.
They're so much smarter than we are,
but they just can't get their heads around computers."

Obviously weak,
he opened his laptop and dragged a couple of documents onto the screen.
"When they come,
show them this.
Tell them there's more in a dead man account.
If they ever bother you and Beauty…"
He drew a finger across his throat.

"Why don't you tell them?"
George said,
already knowing the answer.

"George…"
His brother shook his head.
"It's okay.
I got to see things I never dreamed of.
And you'll be fine."

"Stop saying that,"
George whispered,
wiping his eyes.
"Just–how can I be fine?
Didn't you hear her?
It's not just you.
We're going to destroy ourselves, all of us.
How can that be fine?"

Robbie's breath whistled slightly as he breathed.
"I met someone when I was…away.
Another switcheroo.
He's an Australian named Kingston-Brown.
Lives in Antarctica about five hundred years from now.
The ice is all gone.
The oceans are anoxic and spewing hydrogen sulphide into the atmosphere.
They're making self-replicating machines to try to scrub it out,
and sending them out to mine asteroids to make solar shields
to try to cool the planet.
They're closer to the end than we are,
but they still make jokes and tell stories.
If they can do it, so can you."

Boots found them there a few hours later,
Robbie's labored breathing finally silent,
George sitting in the dark,
the shattered remains of the strange crystal device by the wall where he'd thrown it.

A month later,
after the first satellite was launched,
an email arrived from Robbie.
"The changes I made to the congestion algorithms freed up some memory,"
it said.
"There wasn't time to test any new code,
so I convinced them to put some literature in,
like the record on Voyager.
I fiddled the inspection records so that everyone would think someone else had checked it."
The list of titles appended to the message included several 20th Century classics,
but when George opened the files,
he laughed for the first time in weeks.
Trolls and mermaids and four-armed green Martians,
quests and dread empires and heroes armed with blasters
who nevertheless fought with swords,
they were all there,
ready for their billion-year slumber.

George stared at the blank page in front of him.
The next satellite was going up in a month,
and another pair the month after that.
There was no way he could get any more stories on board,
so what was the point of writing them?
But then he remembered what his brother told him,
after they had talked
and played one last hand of poker
to the sound of Bowie tunes from the 1970s.
"The point is that it's not over *yet*," Robbie had said.
"The point is whatever you do *now*."

George picked up his pen.

*He set the last stone on the double cairn,
wiped the sweat from his face,
and stepped back.
His younger brother had held the polyp larvae back long enough
for the mysterious old woman to somehow make them real–at least,
real enough for a blaster to kill–but the effort had drained them both.
With her last breath,
the old woman had whispered something in his brother's ear.
His eyes had widened.
"Of course,"
he had murmured,
his question finally answered.*

*The older brother
(for he would always think of himself that way)
shouldered his pack.
The food and water in the old woman's cave had been carefully packed for travel,
almost as if she had been expecting him.
The box of soul jade that had been waiting on the shelf beside them
would let him hire an army and take back the throne,
or buy an airship and find out what lay beyond the sulfurous sea.*

*He looked up at the orange sun,
dying but not yet dead,
and set off to find out what would happen next.*

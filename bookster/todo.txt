- Razi should be a member of a secret society (so should Piaerre).
  Erileine feels left out.

- "Erileine pressed herself against the tilted wall" she still has the
  magic sword at this point (?).

- A fancy inn where they put little cups of tea out for people to
  spill on purpose at breakfast to get the day's bad luck out of the
  way.

- Bigger reveal for the captain's death and its effect on Piaerre.

- Jaromir has to be in the scene at the end.

- Describe the layout at the peak better so that when Razi is thrown
  over the side, it makes sense.

- Erileine's numb hand has to matter in the end: allows her to grasp
  the Pilot Stone when others can't.

- Bonescuttles come boiling out of the underground when the mountain
  berths: people aren't attacked, but they're terrified as the
  creatures flee.  (Leaves people wondering how well they ever really
  knew the mountain.) Vurt grumbles that the skull of the first
  bonescuttle he killed was bigger.

- Why are the Avauntois able to go into the tunnels at the end when
  they were so afraid earlier in Vurt's story?  They don't - Vurt
  does.

- The next morning, many of the Hett are gone (including Jaromir).
  Erileine asks what's happening; the woman who is now in command (the
  one who he remembers spying) tells him brusquely that they were
  needed elsewhere to clear land. This starts a swirl of rumors among
  the Avauntois: are the Hett planning to build their own villages,
  rather than force the Avauntois out? How will the mountain sustain
  them? (The last only works if I've already had people discuss the
  fact that the mountain is slowly running out of topsoil---I need
  this to foreshadow key elements of the sequel.)

- Razi: "We back into the future (must do, because we can see the past
  as we go)."

- Spitting seeds over the balcony, watching the cat run up to each one
  in turn to sniff it.

- "The problem with books is that they can't change their minds."

- Feeding dyed grain to chickens to make them lay colored eggs (a
  story Laeuc told Erileine when she was young; Erileine still has the
  egg).

"I don't work with musicians.
Or actors, or celebrity chefs, or virtuals.
You know that."

Bench grinned.
"Maybe this'll change your mind."
She pulled a holo out of the sleeve pocket of her suit jacket,
slid it across the black quartzite table,
and sat back looking smug.

I moved my coffee aside and picked it up.
"Turner," I said.
"*Rain, Steam, and Speed*.
Mid 1840s.
It's beautiful."
I sighed as Bench's grin widened to show off her fashionable steel teeth.
"Let me guess---your noodle has it."

"He's not 'mine', and he's not a noodle.
He's just...young."
She waved a hand to forgive everyone in the world with fewer than her thirty-odd years.
"He picked it up at an estate sale a few months ago,
and yes,
I made sure it was hung properly.
Just give him ten minutes,"
she wheedled.
"I'll tell him you need to,
I don't know,
center yourself or something.
You can have as much time with it as you want before you have to talk to him."

I gave her a tired look.
"Excellent," she purred,
reaching for her pad.
"He's not really a morning person, so how about---"

A hundred devices beeped, bleebled, or chimed in unison,
instantly derailing the conversations around us.
"Called it," Bench said,
turning her pad to show me the news.
Vitaly Mendonca:
Brazilian,
fifty-four,
inherited a construction company after his father died (of natural causes),
then made a fortune in remediation work.
He'd been on and off the leaderboard for years,
always safely out of the top hundred until three days ago
when a combination of fluctuating exchange rates
and an automatic contract renewal his agent hadn't accounted for
had catapulted him into the red zone.
He'd been unloading stuff frantically since then---some German whiz kid
whose name I sort of recognized had done a flurry of last-second divestments---but
apparently it hadn't been enough.
A few minutes ago he had gone from
briefly being the richest person in the world
to permanently being dead.

I swallowed the last of my coffee and stood up,
tucking the holo into my sleeve.
"Put him in my calendar," I said as the buzz in the coffee shop resumed.
"Give me half an hour with the Turner.
And Bench---he really better not be a noodle."

---

He was a noodle.
I got an hour with the Turner,
though,
which almost made the trip worthwhile.
It dropped out of sight in the early '30s
when English museums started renting out their collections to make ends meet.
It showed up in Italy a few years later,
pre-leaderboard,
then disappeared again until Guo Leji stopped being
Vice Premier of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
(or so my pad told me)
and started being dead.

I scrolled down,
filling time while my minidrone camera completed its scan of the Turner.
Guo's story was typical:
graft, bribes, fingers in too many pies, yadda bloody boo,
all of it so tangled that even his AI accountants couldn't keep track of it.
Or maybe he didn't trust them and tried to keep it all in his head.

The camera chimed softly to tell me it was done.
I held out my hand and waited for it to settle on my palm.
Twelve terabytes wasn't an archival-quality scan,
but it was more than enough to train the AI painting tutor I was working with,

I'd put off the inevitable for as long as I plausibly could.
I put the camera in its case,
put the case in my satchel,
took a deep breath,
and went to find Bench and her client.

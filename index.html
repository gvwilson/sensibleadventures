      <p>
        Once upon a time a little girl was born.
        This is the story of the numbers that were born with her–where they came from,
        how they moved from place to place,
        who used them and fixed them and how they met other numbers
        until finally, one day, they were called home.

      <p>
        In the beginning there was a great Big Bang, so powerful that
        the whole universe is still expanding.  This is the story of
        what happened afterward, of the Earth and life and civilization
        and maybe, just maybe, of what comes next.

      <p>
        Once upon a time, a young puppet named Still lived in a city
        full of wonders.  This is the story of the worst thing that ever
        happened to her: about violins and gargoyles, glass rats and
        friendship, and in the end, about—ah, but that would be telling…

        Take a mountain, lift it into the air, and set it adrift: that
        is Avaunt.  But look closer—there, in a village on its starboard
        flank. A girl is running for her life. She just felt the
        mountain shake for the first time in centuries, but that's not
        what she's afraid of. She's afraid of what the boy chasing her
        will do if he catches her…

        A young man descends into the crypts beneath the city to slay a monster,
        a woman plots to steal her niece's youth,
        a talking horse foils a robbery,
        a ghost remembers how he earned his name,
        and a magician wonders why she can't get an old nursery rhyme out of her head.
        With swordplay, betrayal, forbidden love, and a philosophically inclined pair of boots,
        <em>Beneath Coriandel</em> will appeal to anyone who liked <em>The Curse of Chalion</em>,
        or <em>The Lies of Locke Lamora</em>.

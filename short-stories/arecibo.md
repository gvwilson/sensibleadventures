<!-- Actual = 3020 CE -->

**Wurdi Youang / Actual minus 12,000 years**
<!-- 8980 BCE -->
<!-- shorten by combining Wharru and Alinta -->
<!-- mention the lost civilization drowned in the Bass Strait between Australia and Tasmania -->

She gave up her name long ago.
It was too heavy to carry as deep into the Dreaming as she needed to go.
She missed it at first,
but everyone who knew her by that name is dead now,
and it amuses her when others call her the Old Woman behind her back.
At some point,
she really ought to tell them that being mostly blind doesn't affect her hearing...

Footsteps crunch on the stream's gravel bank.
She sighs as the fish she was hoping to catch darts away.
"Who's there?" she asks,
the stream caressing her knees as she turns to face whoever has frightened her dinner away.

"It's Wharru," the young man says.
"There's a stranger in camp."
He is one of the new arrivals,
still thin and angry after his long trek from the drowning lands.
His clan lost their farms to the ever-rising sea,
and many were killed or enslaved.
It will be many years before he is ready to let go of that weight,
but he has helped her realign some of the stones without complaint
and doesn't snore or fart as much as some of the others.

"From down below?" she asks,
sloshing through the stream to join him.

"I don't think so."
Wharru hesitates.
"He's not like any real people I've ever seen.
Alinta thinks he might be a bad spirit."

"Feh."
The old woman picks up the walking stick and skin bag
that together are half of everything she can call her own.
"Alinta thinks *everyone* is a bad spirit.
Come on, let's go meet them."

The stranger isn't in camp.
"I told him to wait for you,"
Alinta says without preamble,
her voice as sharp as the stone knife in her hand.
"I told him it's a powerful place,
you shouldn't go there without her,
you'll make the ancestors angry,
but no,
*he* wanted to see the *sunset*."
She sets aside her knife,
grabs the feet of the gweela she is dressing with one hand,
and pulls hard with the other.
The bird's skin comes off 
with a sound that never fails to make the old woman's stomach turn.

The old woman sighs to herself.
The half-dozen people doing chores within earshot have paused their conversations
to listen to Alinta.
They will follow her once the old woman joins the ancestors,
and in her heart,
the old woman knows that will be the end of the stones.

She jerks her chin at the dripping carcass in Alinta's hands.
"Enough there for company?"

Alinta scowls.
"Hardly enough for *us*."

The old woman nods.
"Well, do what you can to stretch it.
Come along."
She digs her elbow into Wharru's ribs.
"Let's go see what this evil spirit of yours wants."

They walk side by side through the long shadows beneath the gum trees.
The old woman has been going up and down this part of the mountain for almost thirty years,
and takes quiet pleasure in thinking that the packed earth is
echoing her own footsteps back at her.
Birds and insects fill the forest with sound,
and once something larger makes the bushes rustle.
Wharru hesitates but the old woman pushes on.
A thylacine wouldn't attack two people together,
and no one has seen a marsupial lion for years.

They reach the field of stones just as the sun is about to kiss the horizon.
There isn't a cloud in the sky,
and if the stranger hadn't been there the old woman would put Wharru to work
sighting along the stones
and marking new positions for them.

But the stranger *is* there,
and even with eyes half-blinded by years of looking too closely at the sun,
the old woman thinks that for once Alinta might be right.
He is taller than anyone the old woman has ever seen
and completely hairless.
An angry young scar runs from his left temple almost to the back of his head,
rough and red against his near-black skin.

He turns as Wharru and the old woman approach him.
She blinks.
His little man is as small as a baby's and he has no bag at all that she could see.

She clears her throat to greet him,
but before the words could leave her mouth he says,
"It does not measure well enough."

Wharru stiffens beside her at the stranger's rudeness.
"Show respect," he says sharply.

She puts a cautionary hand on his arm.
"What do you mean, not well enough?"

The stranger gestures at the oval of basalt that has taken the old woman a lifetime to assemble.
There are exactly one hundred and twenty one stones,
each with a name known only to the old woman and whoever helped her place it.
She could pick some up one-handed,
but others took two people and a wooden travois to move,
and each of the waist-high trio at the oval's sunset end
needed a year of hard work to haul up the mountain and put in place.

"I need to know..."
The stranger pauses and blinks rapidly several times.
"This language does not have the words.
I need to know a moment."
He gestures at the scar on his head.
"My people can only hear me at some moments,
but I am damaged.
I do not know when those moments are any more.
I must add to find them.
I need to measure to add,
but this does not measure well enough."

The old woman clucks her tongue.
"I don't understand.
Do you want to add a stone?"
Is part of his spirit lost in the Dreaming?
She has seen it before.
A stone struck a man on the head.
When he woke two days later
he moved slowly and was confused by the simplest things.

The stranger shakes his head.
"No.
'Add' is not right.
I need to---this language does not have the words.
I need to count the spaces between the stars to know when my people will be able to hear me.
What you have built does measure well enough.
It is of no use."

"It is of great use!" Wharru says hotly.
"It tells us when the seasons will turn and what path the moon will take.
It tells us when the ancestors are closest to us!"

The stranger does not reply to that.
He just looks at the old woman.
*He knows,* she realizes.
He knows the same thing she knows,
that there are patterns in the stars and the lights that wander among them,
and that those patterns *mean* something.

"I must look elsewhere," the stranger says abruptly.
With nothing more than that he starts to walk past them.

Wharru catches his arm.
"Are they all so rude where you come from?" he demands.

"Wharru, don't," the old woman protests,
but the young man ignores her.
He fought and killed on his way to the mountain,
and in that sunset moment she can see his battles in the way he shifts his weight,
ready to strike or to fend off a blow.

But that blow never comes.
With a rasping roar,
the lion that had crept closer while they were distracted
bursts out of the trees behind them.

The old woman screams as the lion knocks her to the ground.
A dazzling pain shoots up her spine as her hip breaks,
then something cracks and the lion goes limp.
The stranger has broken its neck with his bare hands
as easily as someone might break a dry twig.

Wharru runs ahead to tell the others what has happened
while the stranger carries the old woman down the mountain as if she were a baby.
She passes out several times,
only to be dragged back into the world by the agony in her hip.
"Who *are* you?" she asks in a moment of lucidity.

The stranger glances down at her.
"I don't remember."
When they reach camp he sets her down gently
and walks away without another word.

*Later,
Alinta pokes at the lion's protruding ribs
and says it must have been desperate with hunger.
It is the last lion they ever see---the last one *anyone* ever sees.
She makes a cloak from its pelt,
but it is lost in a flood many years later and many miles away.
The old woman lives another season,
but is never able to go back up the mountain to track the sun and moon and stars with her stones.
She wonders sometimes who the stranger was
and whether he ever found a way count the spaces between the stars.*

**Chankillo / Actual minus 3400 years**
<!-- 380 BCE -->
<!-- mention the pyramids: wars got in the way, so the stranger thought somewhere isolated would work better -->

As a child,
Second Bird's diet consisted of maize, beans, the occasional roasted guinea pig,
and his grandfather's stories of the war.
The First People rose up against the highlanders' god-king many times.
Each rebellion ended the same way,
with entire families staked out in the desert
and ever-harsher conditions for the survivors.

"So we wept and we *learned*," Fast Rock says,
grunting the last word as he turns over a spadeful of damp soil.
He and Second Bird have been clearing this irrigation channel for nine days.
It is slow, slippery, back-breaking work,
but Second Bird doesn't mind:
all of the other chores are just as hard,
and he secretly enjoys his grandfather's stories.

Fast Rock drives his spade into the ground again.
"The trick was,"
heave,
"We all had,"
heave,
"To rise,"
heave,
"together."
He pauses a moment to wipe sweat from his brow
while Second Bird drags the reed basket of soil out of the way
and pushes an empty one into place.
One more basket and they will trade places.
Four more after that wwill make eight for them to carry a hundred strides
to fill the gap where the riverbank had given way.

The numbers dance in Second Bird's head.
They have made six such journeys so far that day
and will make another eight before the sun sets.
Six plus eight is ten with four.
Ten with four upon itself nine times is five twenties with six.
If they are half done---he glances at the river to check yet again---then yes,
it will have taken ten twenties with ten and two trips to finish.
At eight baskets a trip,
that will be---

The ground shakes.
Ripples dance across the flat stinking water in the irrigation channel.
Someone shouts a warning two channels over.
Someone else screams.

"Grandfather!"
He grabs Fast Rock's outstretched hand and pulls the old man up out of the channel.
The spade whacks his shin.
Later,
he will realize that it cut him,
and will go back and burn herbs to cleanse the ground where his blood spilled,
but at that moment all he can think is, *The world is ending.*

Dry soil loosened by the earthquake slumps into the canal,
undoing all of their work.
Fast Rock stares at it for a moment,
then draws the knife that always hangs at his waist.
"Come with me!" he orders.

"Where are we going?" Second Bird asks,
running after him.

"The evil one," Fast Rock says grimly.
"He must not escape."

Every handspan of green land was a gift from the gods.
Even the highlanders understood that,
and built their villages where the green ended and the hard dry desert began.
Most of those villages are empty now,
home only to wild creatures and ghosts.
Second Bird has ventured into the nearest one on a dare,
marveling at the carved stones and at streets wide enough for six people to walk side by side.
He has never gone to the center,
though,
and neither have any of the other children.
Only the old men go there,
and even they only go in pairs.

Another building has collapsed.
Second Bird counts the tumbled stones at a glance.
"Grandfather---" he begins.

"Good," the old man pants,
slowing to a walk.
He gestures with his knife.
"The sooner...
they come down...
the sooner...
our gods will come back."
And end the drought,
he doesn't add.
He doesn't need to:
every one of the First People's prayers has begged for that for six long years.

They come around a corner and face-to-face with a nightmare.
The highlanders' nameless god-king stands in front of the collapsed wall
of the storehouse where the First People imprisoned him.
Two old men stand opposite him,
spears clutched in their hands.

Second Bird grabs his grandfather's arm.
"Wait," he pleads.
The god-king is faster and stronger than any mortal being.
It took a dozen men to subdue him,
and the only one to survive his wounds from that battle
cannot beat him with only a knife.

Fast Rock smacks his grandson's hand away and advances slowly,
his knife held low.
One of the guards shifts to the side to make space for him
without taking his eyes off the god-king.

"So," Fast Rock says after a moment.
"What now?"

The god-king is a head taller than anyone Second Bird has ever seen,
with skin like charcoal and an old scar on the left side of his head.
Naked,
thin from years of starvation,
and covered in dust,
he is still more frightening than Second Bird has ever imagined.

"I said, what now?" Fast Rock demands.

The god-king blinks as if waking.
"I need to see the stars," he says abruptly,
and then turns and walks away.

The two guards look at Fast Rock helplessly.
"Get help," the old man orders,
taking the nearest one's spear.
"Get *everyone*.
It's time we ended this."

"But---"

"Now!"
he bellows,
and the guard takes off at a run.

Fast Rock bares his teeth.
"Come on."

They follow the god-king into the desert.
At first Second Bird thinks he is headed for the fortress that the highlanders built
when they first swept down over the valleys,
but he walks past it without a glance.
That leaves the towers,
thirteen of them in a row on a ridge looking west,
each one built at a cost of dozens of lives.

Others join them,
some carrying spears,
others with whatever tools they were using when the earth shook.
Two men have thought to bring a net like the one Fast Rock and his companions used
to ensnare the god-king on the day of the rising,
and an old woman has a pouch of herbs and a needle and thread for wounds.

Ten twenties of twenties of strides bring them to the stairs leading up to the first tower.
Second Bird counts each step automatically
and wonders for a moment if the number being so clean is some kind of sign.

The god-king stands alone at the top of the tower.
"Should we set an ambush?" one of the men carrying the net hisses at Fast Rock.

The old man snorts.
"How?"
There is no way to get above the tower stairs and nothing to hide behind.

He gestures at the nearest men.
"Spread out.
When he comes down, you three get behind him, but wait for my word.
We must all attack at once."

"Attack?"
one man says incredulously.
"*Him?*"

"He has been in prison longer than my grandson has been alive,"
Fast Rock says curtly.
"He will be weak."

"Doesn't *look* weak," the man says under his breath,
but he takes a position.

They wait.
And wait.
Finally Fast Rock cups his hands around his mouth.
"What are you doing up there?" he shouts.

People gasp.
Monster or not, you don't yell at gods.

But he replies.
"I am looking at the stars,"
he calls down.

"Bit early for that, isn't it?" Fast Rock yells up.
"I mean, wouldn't it be better to wait until they're actually there?"

"The stars are always there."
There is a moment of silence.
"It is good to see them again."

Second Bird looks questioningly at his grandfather.
The old man shrugs,
then tenses as the god-king comes down the steps.

The men shuffle into a semi-circle around him
when he reaches the bottom.
The god-king looks past them at the thin green ribbon of life running through the desert.
"These are hard times for you,"
he says.

Fast Rock shrugs.
"Not as hard as your time was.
But it'll get better."

The god-king shakes his head.
"No, it will not.
This is a new---" he hesitates.
"Balance.
A new balance of long weather.
This valley can no longer sustain as many people as my work needs.
I must build my tools elsewhere."

He takes a step forward,
pulling up short when the tip of Fast Rock's spear touches his chest.
"Your 'tools'?" the old man snarls.
"Is that what you call this?
We *died* here, monster.
We died and died and died to build---what?"

"A way to measure the stars,"
the god-king says evenly.
"I need to measure them very exactly to know when I can speak with my people."

And just like that a lifetime of puzzle pieces click together in Second Bird's head.
"The solstice," he breathes.

The god-king swivels his head to look at Second Bird in a motion more lizardly than human.
"Yes.
Knowing the exact moment of the solstice is a start,
but only a start.
These tools are not good enough to do more."
His wave takes in the towers,
the people,
and the entire river valley.

"Not *good* enough?" Fast Rock snarled.
"We have *bled*.
We have *died*.
We have bowed our heads for a hundred years,
and you say it's not *enough*?"
He lunges.

The god-king slaps the spear-thrust aside as if swatting a fly.
One of the men behind him takes a step forward.
Without even looking,
the god-king raises a hand to point straight at him.
"Do not," he says flatly.
Further around the circle,
the two men with the net shuffle their feet but make no move.

Fast Rock spits at the god-king's feet.
"So now what?
Are we to be your slaves again?"

The god-king shakes his head slowly.
"No."
For the first time Second Bird hears emotion in his voice---regret,
perhaps,
or something close to it.
"Sooner or later, your kind will always rebel.
I must consider a different approach."
He turns and walks into the desert without another word.

*Many years later,
Second Bird takes his grandchildren to the towers.
He tells them the story of the god-king
and shows them how to predict the changing seasons by the way certain stars line up with the towers.
As he falls asleep for the last time,
he wonders if the god-king ever found someone to build what he needed.*

**Gyeongju / Actual minus 2300 years**
<!-- 720 CE -->
<!-- Add mention of dark stranger in Chinese records - the visitor thinks the stranger is an alchemist with the secret of eternal life -->

"It was Her Majesty's first decree as princess,"
the young astrologer says,
immediately hating himself for telling such a distinguished scholar
something he undoubtedly already knows.

But the visitor from the Middle Kingdom smiles politely as he studies the star-gazing tower.
It is the height of five men,
and to the educated eye,
the number and placement of its stones represent historical and astronomical figures.
"I understand her decision was...not universally popular," he says.

The young astrologer inclines his head,
conscious of two guards standing a few feet away.
"Not universally popular" didn't quite capture the way the aristocracy felt
about a woman ascending to the throne,
but it is neither polite nor prudent to dwell upon that,
particularly not when rumors of Her Majesty's illness flutter around the court like pigeons.

"Ah, and this must be our foreign barbarian,"
the visitor continues
as a tall figure in the plain brown robe of a monk
comes up the gravel path in the waning evening light.

The young astrologer inclines his head again.
He is no longer taken aback by the foreigner's black skin,
but thinks he will never get used to how quietly he walks.
"Are you at peace?" he asks in greeting.

"I am, and you?"
He has forgotten to wear sandals again,
the young astrologer notes,
but according to the caretaker he has at least eaten that day.
Her Majesty's minister insist on regular reports,
and the young astrologer would rather fill them with trivia
than even hint at some of the unorthodox things the foreigner says.

He clears his throat.
"May I have the honor of introducing you to scholar Liu Zhao,
who has come from the court of the Gaozong Emperor?
I apologize for any appearance of poor manners,"
he continues hurriedly to the scholar,
"But my colleague has no name by which to be introduced."

Scholar Liu raises a perfectly groomed eyebrow.
"Not even a temple name?"

"I am not a monk,"
the foreigner says.
"I have simply forgotten it."
He brushes a finger over the old scar that wrinkles the left side of his head.

Scholar Liu smiles.
"And to think there are those who spend their lifetimes trying to let go of such things."
He gestures at the tower.
"Or to build such marvels as this."

The foreigner nods.
"It has been very useful."

"Mm."
Scholar Liu jerks his chin at the scrolls tucked into the foreigner's satchel.
"I have heard much about the records you have made.
I am told they are extremely precise."

The foreigner gives a small shrug.
"As precise as they can be.
Improving them will be the work of many lifetimes."

The young astrologer opens his mouth to suggest that they climb the tower,
but is interrupted by a shout as a guard comes running up the path.
"Her Majesty..." he pants,
speaking to the two escorts rather than to the scholars.
"Her Majesty is gone. She is gone."

The soft buzz of dusk insects is the only sound in the shocked silence that follows.
"Stay here,"
the oldest guard orders his partner.
He hurries away with the messenger in tow,
their armor clanking in time with their steps.
Queen Seondeok's desire for her cousin to succeed her is well known,
but it has only been a week since her chief minister led another abortive uprising against her rule,
and only a day since he and his thirty followers were beheaded.

Scholar Liu waits until they have vanished among the ornamental bushes
then gestures to the remaining guard.
*He has been bribed,* the young astrologer realizes
as the guard steps out of earshot.
It is hardly surprising:
he has bribed guards himself on occasion,
though he suspects he has paid them more than he needed to.

Scholar Liu turns to the foreigner.
"Come with me,"
he says without preamble.
"Come with me to the court of the Gaozong Emperor.
We will build a tower twice the height of this *cheomseongdae*
and you will have a dozen scribes to record your every thought."
He steps closer,
lowering his voice as if seducing a lady of the court.
"It need not be the work of many lifetimes.
We can find the key to all knowledge in *this* one."
He glances at the young astrologer.
"You can even bring your...companion...if you wish.
I'm sure we can find something for him to do as well."

The young astrologer blushes furiously.
The word Scholar Liu has used for companion---the implications of it---he
has fantasized about such a thing many times,
but has never dared do more.
The shame it would bring his family if they were caught,
not to mention the impossible awkwardness of trying to raise the subject
with someone he practically worshipped---

But the foreigner is already shaking his head.
"You would not have come this far to make such an offer
unless you already had the Emperor's favor or were desperate for it,
and I do not think you already have it."

The ingratiating expression on Scholar Liu's face melted,
leaving anger in its wake.
"So you consider yourself an expert on the court as well as the stars?"

The foreigner inclines his head.
"Sadly,
I suspect little has changed since I served the Emperor Taiwu."

Scholar Liu snorts.
"That was two hundred years ago."

"Nevertheless."
The foreigner gestures at the tower.
"You are of course still welcome to join us tonight.
If it is clear,
I may be able to show you the slow wanderer we have found beyond Saturn."

The scholar scowls.
"I would learn as much from the beasts of the forest.
Come!"
He snaps his fingers at the guard and stalks away like an affronted cat.

The young astrologer turns to the foreigner.
"Being invited to the emperor's court is quite an honor,"
he ventures cautiously.
"There are many fine scholars there with whom you could converse."

The foreigner nods.
"I'm sure there are.
But I find no deficiency of any kind in those I know here."
And for the first time,
he smiles.

*The succession proves peaceful.
Queen Jindeok rules for seven years.
The young astrologer grows to middle age,
successfully evading all of the marriage traps set by his extended family.
He gets mildly drunk one night to celebrate the successful prediction of a lunar eclipse
and finally acts on twenty years of desire
by reciting a love poem to the foreigner on top of the star-gazing tower.
When he wakes the next morning the foreigner has vanished.*

**Maragheh / Actual minus 1700 years**
<!-- 1320 CE -->
<!-- fell apart after el-Tusi's son became director after his father's death in 1274 CE -->

"But you could take the books."
Batu has led his *arban* back and forth across half of Asia.
They have fought Uzbeks,
Pathans,
Persians,
Pathans again,
bandits,
Turks,
and even a company of Frankish mercenaries
who somehow found themselves east of the Black Sea.
They have heard him bellow orders,
scream as they gallopped into battle,
and even sing in a surprisingly melodious voice,
but they have never heard him be quite as sarcastic as this.

Otgon clears his throat and hefts the golden candlestick he holds
as if unsure whether he should drop it,
hand it to his commander,
or hide it behind his back.
"Yes sir.
There are some tapestries too, and a samovar.
He says we can have those too,
just as long as we leave the books alone."

"How kind," Batu says.
"Tell me---does he *look* mad?"

"No sir. He looks Ethiopian."

"Who does?"
Batu glances over his shoulder at the question,
then drops to one knee,
eyes downcast.
The men in his *arban* follow suit.

"My *beg*,"
he says.

"Get up, get up."
Mirza Muhammad Taraghay bin Shahrukh wears a quilted jacket like his troops,
though his is fine silk instead of homespun linen.
His personal guard stands behind him,
blades bared and eyes constantly moving.
Maragheh hadn't put up much of a fight,
but the *beg* has many enemies.
"What's this about an Ethiopian?"

Batu gets to his feet,
careful not to wince at the protest from his knee.
"Up the hill, my *beg*,"
he says.
"Some crazy man saying we can have the gold if we leave the books."
He snaps his fingers at Otgon,
who holds up the golden candlestick for inspection
like a child showing a toy he has made.

The *beg* narrows his eyes.
"Interesting.
Come, let us see what he has to say."

Batu and his *arban* follow the *beg* and his entourage up the hill.
"Tuck it under your coat,"
Batu mutters to Otgon.
"If you're lucky, he'll forget you have it."
*If you're very lucky,* he amends in his head.
The man people are already calling Ulugh Beg---Great Ruler---is
as famous for his intelligence as he is for his ancestry.
Still,
a man can hope...

The observatory was a marvel in its heyday,
but time, neglect, and decades of minor earthquakes
have brought one wall wall down completely
and left others leaning perilously.
The *beg* picks his way across the cracked and tilted courtyard tiles
to the one door that still hangs true in its frame.
To Batu's surprise he pauses at its threshold and knocks.
"Peace be upon you," he calls.
"May we enter?"

There is a moment's pause,
then a weary voice says,
"If you wish."

The *beg* looks at the captain of his personal guard,
who looks Batu,
who looks at Otgon,
who salues,
hands the candlestick to his brother,
and steps through the door.
Batu follows,
and the *beg* follows him.

Batu has never seen so many books.
For a moment he feels the same way he did when his father first took him to Samarkand.
How could there be so much world?

Then the Ethiopian stirs and Batu's attention snaps back to the here and now.
He wears the simple white robe of a pilgrim with a matching turban.
A samovar stands near his elbow,
and the tools of a tailor and a leatherworker are laid out neatly on the table for mending books.

He stands and bows.
The *beg* returns it as though to an equal.
"I have been looking forward to meeting you," he says.

The Ethiopian cocks his head quizzically.
"One of my tutors spoke of you,"
the *beg* continues.
"He studied trigonometry with the great al-Tusi,
and showed me a copy of the *zij* you drew up to predict the positions of the stars and planets.
It was..."
The *beg* spreads his hands as if words alone could not capture what it was.

The Ethiopian sighs.
"It was the best start I have ever made," he says.
"I thought---"
He blinks,
and for a moment Batu wonders if he is going to cry.

"I thought I could make some real progress this time,"
the Ethiopian continues quietly,
more to himself than to the *beg* or his soldiers.
"When al-Tusi persuaded Hulagu Khan to build this
I thought I would finally be able to get past the bare beginning,
but..."
He gestures,
not needing to say,
but now it is half-ruined,
its instruments broken and its books stolen or burned or their pages ruined by rain.

The *beg* chuckles.
"You sound like I used to.
'I must do this, I must do that.'
You make yourself your own worst enemy."

The Ethiopian frowns.
"I don't understand."

Ulugh Beg points at Batu.
"You.
How many men in your *arban*?"

"Nine, *beg*," the old soldier says promptly.
He clears his throat.
"Should be ten, but Dzhambul took an arrow in the leg and ---"

The *beg* cuts him off with a hand wave.
"And you fight together, yes?
You stand watch while each other sleep?"

"Yes, *beg*," Batu says.
He learned long ago not to ask officers what point they were trying to make.

The *beg* turns back to the Ethiopian.
"You said *you* would be able to.
What if I built you a school in Samarkand?
What if you taught others the method of triangles and all of al-Tusi's other arts?"
His wave takes in the whole world outside the ruined library.
"What if you didn't have to do everything by yourself?"

The Ethiopian stares at him.
His hand goes to his left temple.
"I---I don't think I'm supposed to."

"Why not?" the *beg* demands.

"I can't remember," the Ethiopian says.
He laughs suddenly.
"I can't remember why not!"

Batu knows the look on the Ethiopian's face as he gathers up his tools
and chooses a dozen books for the *beg*'s soldiers to bring with them.
It is the look of a man going into battle for the first time.

*Otgon dies later that year when a Georgian knifes him in a campfire squabble over a game of dice.
Batu loses an arm in battle outside Balkh,
but finds a position as a caretaker at the new observatory in Samarkand.
The beg's catalog of the positions of 994 stars,
known as the Zij-i-Sultani,
is the most accurate made in over a thousand years.*

**Uraniborg / Actual minus 1400 years**
<!-- 1620 CE -->
<!-- Local children think it's haunted - surprised when the stranger shows up with two mercenaries to retrieve some records hidden under the floor -->
<!-- Locals think the stranger is a witch - Emperor Ferdinand has just started the Thirty Years' War -->

Uraniborg was built between 1576 and 1580 on the island of Hven by Tycho Brahe, then expanded to Stjerneborg after it turned out that tower-mounted instruments swayed too much in the wind. Brahe abandoned the site in 1597 after he fell out of favor with the Danish king Christian IV; it was destroyed in 1601. It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe.

**Mathura / Actual minus 1145 years**
<!-- 1875 CE -->
<!-- Revolt is almost twenty years ago, but this was torn down before then -->
<!-- Stranger has come to feel nostalgic in an era of transit measurements and big telescopes - "What I have started has outgrown me." -->
<!-- Looks at the poverty and oppression and is troubled -->

A "Jantar Mantar" is a giant sundial with a triangular gnomon whose hypotenuse is parallel to the Earth's axis. On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle parallel to the plane of the equator. The instrument can measure the time of day to an accuracy of half a second. "Yantra mantar" means "calculation instrument". There were five, but the one in Mathura was torn down just before the Revolt of 1857 (possibly just neglect and scavenging).

**Arecibo / Actual minus 979 years**
<!-- 2041 CE -->
<!-- The stranger has a fake ID, but so does everyone with money these days. -->
<!-- Come to see a VR exhibit showing Arecibo in its prime - the island's depopulation accelerates as storms worsen. -->
<!-- The stranger is funding some of the relocation - feels guilty about diverting money from astronomy, but other trillionaires are backing that now. -->

The Arecibo Radio Observatory was completed in 1963; it was 305m in diameter and made out of 38,778 perforated aluminum panels. It collapsed on Dec 1, 2020 after years of dwindling funding. (CE 2041)

<!-- 2125 CE -->
<!-- Finally connects with whoever, has a way home, realizes that rebuilding is more important. -->
<!-- Whoever tries to stop him, he injures himself (again, he realizes, it must be again) and puts himself in a hibernation pod. -->
<!-- He has little fuel, so his trajectory is slow and complicated, but he has had practice with celestial calculations. -->

"have you inned this emma's blurb?" Red asks.
"the seawall failed again."

They don't need to say which seawall---they were born and raised in Manhattan.
They didn't need to tell the others it had failed, either.
Everyone scans the news from Earth constantly,
hoping not to see anywhere they know mentioned.

Blue sucks the last few drops of water from a drinking bag
and folds it neatly to tuck in their pocket.
"does this mean they're finally going to evacuate?"

Red shrugs,
then reaches out to stabilize themself against the wall.
The observatory's social module is big enough for all four of them to feel comfortable,
but only if they stay close to the sides.

"i'm more 'smayed by our socials,"
Green says glumly.
"still well below redline.
dunno what genius thought deep space astro was gonna get enough feels to notice."

Black says nothing.
The others don't know that they are the genius in question,
or that they spent enough in bribes to reforest the state of Oregon
to make the observatory a reality.
Fabbing a backstory solid enough to get themself on it cost less
but required much more care.
In the end,
they left enough gaps and icy patches to convince anyone who dug deep
that they were a spook twitching for some *other* corp, klept, or agency.

They glance out the window.
It is the one indulgence they allowed themself in the observatory's design.
Everyone can in data and visuals directly at any resolution they want,
but after so many years it is somehow important to Black
that they be able to *see* the stars.

The depressed silence is broken by a *ping* they each hear through their own implants.
Four tongues key codes on teeth.
Four pairs of eyelids blink reflexively as a visual of the observatory's avatar is stimmed in their retina.

"there is a problem with the incoming supply shot,"
the cartoonish face tells them.
The avatar was originally lifelike,
but the crew consensused shortly after arrival
that they preferred something less real.
They kept the verbal nicety protocol, though,
and someone (none of them will admit to it) gave the observatory a Russian accent.

Blue gasps.
"that can't be right!"
Annotated visuals take shape, twist, are decorated with ever-richer annotations.

"no," Black breathes.
"no no no."
It is the most emotion the other have ever heard from them.
"how could this happen?
has it malfunctioned?"

"that's no malf," Red snaps.
"that's sab---gotta be.
look."
The supply shot is still several light seconds away,
but they have already queried its onboards.
There, there, and there---the observatory highlights sections of the supply shot's little AI
that have somehow been modified.

"looks like a hardware hack," Red continues,
fingers twitching as they dive deeper into the code.
"someone must have freaked a couple of chips on a delay to get around the checksums."

"never mind how."
Blue has sims running.
Event trees flourish, are pruned, flourish again.
With overwhelming probability they reach the same conclusion.
The supply shot has burned all of its maneuvering reserve to accelerate onto a collision course.
It will hit the observatory in 27 minutes,
and there is nothing they can do to stop it.

"incoming," the observatory says needlessly.
The message is already in their visuals.
A logo,
one of many they saw on banners waved by people protesting the observatory's construction and launch,
and then a face and the inevitable manifesto.
The seas are rising,
super-storms rage across three continents,
hundreds of millions are displaced,
how dare a few trillionaires waste precious resources on something as frivolous as a deep space observatory?

Black ignores the angry message and their own pounding heart.
They are close,
closer than they have ever been.
Just a little more data and they would finally have the alignments they need.
They fork Blue's sims and change some parameters.
"here," they say urgently,
pushing a scenario at their crewmates.
"if you boost now you can get back to Earth.
i can spin like *this* to take the impact in the sleeping quarters."

"are you scattered?"
Green demands incredulously.
"we're not leaving you to die!"

"i won't die," Black says,
already queueing up the necessary commands.
The observatory is delicate and ungainly,
and its instruments are as fragile as they are sensitive.
Taking the impact in the crew quarters is the only way to be sure
that shrapnel won't damage anything that matters.
They can sleep in the greenhouse afterward.

"unacceptable,"
Blue says flatly.
"we are all---"

Black doesn't wait for them to finish their sentence.
Anyone with sixty trillion new dollars to spend on an observatory
in the same orbit as the Earth but half-way around the Solar System
can afford the hundred million or so it costs to hack someone's service conditioning.
When any personality traits that might have impaired Red, Green, and Blue's performance were suppressed,
a few extra commands were slipped in.

Black keys a trigger sequence.
Their three crewmates stiffen and then relax,
their eyes slightly out of focus.
The trainer who did the work thought Black wanted to be able to use them for sex
or have them sacrifice themselves if necessary.

"go to the rv," Black orders.
"launch for earth immediately,
then put yourselves in cryo."
The return vehicle is a nuclear-powered ion drive,
four cryo capsules,
and an AI just smart enough to get back to Earth.

Black undogs the hatch to the RV
while the other three crewmembers strip and empty their bladders and bowels.
Red airswims into the claustrophobic capsule followed closely White.
They busy themselvs with tubes and leads.

Blue hesitates.
For a moment Black thinks the conditioning hasn't worked,
but they just say, "good luck,"
and then they too are gone.

There is a faint *clonk* as the RV disengages its clamps.
Black closes their eyes and watches it leave.
A bright arc decorated with information traces its path away from the observatory.
Another arc shows the incoming supply shot.
Black wills commands to the AI.
The instruments cannot be moved too quickly---it would cost them months to recalibrate
the micrometer-accurate spacing of the fractal antenna arrays,
and they no longer have months of reserves.
All they can do is turn the observatory module itself to put it in harm's way
and seal the internal hatches.

Fifteen seconds.
Ten.
Five.
Black takes a deep breath.

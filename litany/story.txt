Come Round Again

- theme: people and worlds may die,
  but they live first,
  and we should celebrate that rather than letting the inevitable spoil enjoyment of today
- setting is a home in Toronto where a brilliant young man named Robbie is dying of cancer
- the protagonist is George, his older brother (and best friend)
  - their mother was a history professor who studied Aeonism and had them on her own
  - A bully once sneered, "Who calls anyone George these days?"
    and Robbie replied, "Someone who isn't drunk and beating up his wife all the time."
    (which was a pretty hard burn for a 10-year-old)
  - George: "How'd you know his dad's beating up his mom?"
  - Robbie (shrugging): "You just have to look"
  - That was in one of his Sherlock Holmes phases
- story opens with a snippet of D&D-style adventure
  - two brothers fighting against hopeless odds beneath a dying sun
- then cuts to George asking the nurse (middle-aged Japanese-American woman) how Robbie is
  - he's been having episodes where he's lucid and keen to work,
    but doesn't seem himself
  - he's always lost himself in his projects, but not like this
- George talks to him
  - Robbie confesses that he's amazed by the stuff he's coming up with in these episodes
  - "I won't live to see the launch, but I can dream about it"
  - George: "It's less than a year"
  - Robbie (coughing): "What a coincidence - I have less than a year."
- George goes and works on the story he's writing
  - graphic novels used as the basis for video games
  - two brothers, one wounded, in a Sareeav palace uncovered after aeons by retreating ice
  - now infested with flying polyps
  - wife comes in to ask how Robbie is, George snaps at her and then apologizes
- George comes back a couple of hours later with a deck of cards
  - no point playing chess (Robbie always won) but he was always too honest to be good at poker
  - Robbie is working and distant
  - George suddenly recognizes the distance: it used to happen to their mother
  - chilled, he knows who to talk to
- next scene he's visiting Agent Biczo, who interviewed them after their mother died
  - moved to Toronto after he retired from whatever government agency he worked for
  - "I think I've earned a little peace and quiet"
  - had made introductions to a couple of people when Robbie was going through a bad patch in his twenties
  - George: "I think whatever happened to Mom... Is it genetic?"
- Biczo comes the next day
  - Robbie confesses that he's been having strange dreams
  - "These things that look like something out of one of George's stories"
  - "Asking me questions about the project"
  - Biczo's ears perk up: what kinds of questions?
  - Robbie (laughing weakly): "They used to be about the self-replication code, but now all they want to know about is George's stories"
  - Biczo is taken aback by that
  - George notices the nurse stumbling at that
  - Robbie: "I wonder... Is this some sort of subconscious thing? Me remembering Mom being like this, and wanting her to know how we turned out?"
- He goes back to sleep
  - George talks to Biczo about his reaction: "What aren't you telling me?"
  - Biczo says it's nothing to worry about, but he's almost as bad at poker as Robbie
- George goes back to his story
  - things have been moved around: "Artists know their desks"
  - asks his wife, but she knows better than to mess with his stuff
  - looks at the story he's been working on, crumples up the page and throws it in rage
  - what's the point?
  - she holds him while he cries
- he decides to go back to Robbie's
  - pair of SUVs parked in front of the house
  - Biczo is there, pained but resolute: "Sorry, kid, but some people need to talk to your brother"
  - they bring an unconscious Robbie out in a wheelchair
  - George: "Where are you taking him?"
  - Agent: "Not your concern"
  - George: "But this is Canada! You can't-"
  - Biczo (tiredly): "They're trying to save the world, kid. They can do whatever they like."
  - George knows nothing about fighting, but enraged, he takes a swing
  - Is grabbed, feels a sting, blacks out
- Wakes up in a hospital bed
  - Door is locked
  - Window looks out on a blank brick wall
  - Nothing in the room he could hurt himself with
  - Drugged and interrogated for hours about Robbie's work, his stories, the questions
  - Agent Biczo is there
  - George: "What have you done with Robbie?"
  - Biczo: "They're just asking him some questions."
  - George: "It's not fair! He doesn't have much time left."
  - Biczo (bitterly): "Have you looked at the world recently, kid? None of us have much time left."
  - continues under his breath: "But these idiots still think they can stop it..."
  - George (strucky by a horrible thought): "Did you do this to Mom? When she - when she went away?"
  - Look on Biczo's face says it all - he's almost as bad at poker as Robbie
  - George (coldly): "I want to fucking kill you.  Why are you doing this to us?"
  - Door opens, Robbie says, "Because they are afraid."
  - Biczo starts to stand, falls unconscious
  - The nurse is there propping Robbie up
  - Robbie (Yith) nods solemnly.  "Hello.  We haven't been properly introduced, but perhaps that can wait."
- Nurse drives them away in a big old American car chosen (George suspects) not just for its trunk space
  - George up front with the nurse, Robbie (Yith) lying down in the back
  - Silence until the nurse says, "Well if we're going to do introductions, I'm Affie."
  - George: "Unusual name for..." awkward hand gesture fills in the "someone Asian"
  - nurse: "My mother named me after her best friend."
- George: "Someone's going to come looking for us"
  - Robbie (Yith): "Probably. This interference is inconvenient."
  - George: "Robbie, what-"
  - nurse: "He's not Robbie right now. He's one of the Great Race."
  - back story as Affie navigates through city traffic
  - George knows a little about Aeonist theology
  - George: "So you're a Yith?"
  - Robbie (Yith) (to Affie): "Will this cause difficulties?"
  - Affie: "Not compared to what you did back there.  And he *is* the author of the stories."
  - George: "Wait, what did you do back there? Did you kill them?"
  - Affie (coldly): "No. That's never been their way, or ours, despite what the government tells itself."
  - Robbie (Yith) (repeating): "Will this cause difficulties?"
  - Affie (gently): "Might be easier if I tell him."
- Affie: "The Litany teaches us that this is just one age of many, and a short one at that, and we're going to end it ourselves."
  - George: "How?"
  - Affie nods out the window at the unseasonally warm Toronto winter.
  - Affie: "We have the dubious distinction of being the only species in the Litany to destroy itself."
  - "And if that was all it was, the Yith might never have bothered with us."
  - "Except we come back. Ages and ages from now, after the Ck'chk'ck and the Sareeav, after the earth has been frozen for an aeon, we come back."
  - George: "How?"
  - Robbie (Yith): "That is unknown to us. There is an age of machines. They have reason and purpose, but not minds, so we cannot put ourselves among them."
  - Robbie (Yith): "They warm the earth and then fill it with all manner of creatures, including humans."
  - Robbie (Yith): "By the time the people of the water wake from their long frozen sleep, it is done and the machines are gone."
  - George: "What's that got to do with Robbie?"
  - Robbie (Yith): "They are his machines, come back from their long exile among the stars.  We hoped he might tell us."
  - George doesn't know
  - The Yith leaves Robbie
  - Robbie (himself) starts coughing: "Take me home"
  - Affie: "They'll come back. They always do."
  - George (fiercely): "Take us home."
- back to the house
  - Affie helps George get Robbie inside, then says she's leaving
  - George and Robbie sitting alone in the dark
  - Robbie has George get a strange crystalline machine out of the closet
  - George: "Mom's art project?"
  - Robbie (shakes head): "It's something they made. Or they had her make.  It gave me some ideas."
  - Robbie (laughs): "It's funny. Mom couldn't get her head around computers any more than they can. Maybe that's why they chose her."
  - obviously weak, he logs in and puts a couple of documents on the screen
  - Robbie: "When they come, show them this and tell them there's more in a dead man account. If they don't leave you alone..."
- George finally asks Robbie if he's gay
  - Robbie laughs: "Probably would have been if I'd ever figured it out. But I did meet someone..."
  - talks a bit about an Australian physicists named Nevil Kingston-Brown who lives in one of the last outposts of Western civilization in Antarctica in 2500
  - they play some poker after that, and talk about their mother, and about growing up
  - then Robbie sleeps and doesn't wake
- after the launch, email from Robbie confessing that he's snuck some of George's stories into the code for the space probe
  - like the record on Voyager, but (shrug) more fun
  - hacked the inspection records so that everyone will think someone else checked it
  - so that even when we're both gone, it'll be out there somewhere
- story closes with one brother in a D&D world grieving at his brother's grave
  - whispers, "But what do I do now?"
  - ghost whispers back, "You live."
  - surviving brother looks at the sun that's not dead yet and sets off

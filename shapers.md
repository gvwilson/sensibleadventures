*Shapers and Bots* is a role-playing game for children age 8 and older.
It is inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
countless stories of talking animals,
and my daughter.
Each game has one or more *players* and one *director*.
Each player takes on the role of one character,
while the director plays the part of all the non-player characters.
(The director is often an adult or the person who created the adventure.)

## Background

Thousands of years ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals
to create dozens of new speciesâ€“and then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels.
Among these are the bots:
thinking machines that were originally built for all manner of purposes,
but which are now their own masters.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you can play the part of a young animal adventurer,
or of a small bot trying to find its place in the world.
You can be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and can travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds
and whether the world is saved from a peril.

## Characters

Every animal character has three *traits* that describe them:

- **Size**: how large are you?

- **Health**: how healthy are you?

- **Coordination**: how coordinated are you?

If there were any human beings left,
an average full-grown human woule have a score of 10 for each trait.
Averages for different kinds of are listed later.

> In exceptional cases,
> a character may have separate **Height** and **Weight** traits
> instead of a single Size trait.

Every animal character has one extra trait that depends on these three:

- **Strength**: how strong are you?

An animal character's Strength is equal to her Size
plus or minus *half* the difference between her Health and 10.
(If a character's Height and Weight are listed separately,
use their Weight when calculating Strength.)
For example,
if a character has a Size of 12 and a Health of 12,
her Strength is 13,
because 12-10 is 2,
and half of 2 is 1.
If that same character had a Health of 9,
her Strength would be 12,
because 9-10 is -1, and -1 divided by 2 is 0 (rounding down).

Every animal character also has scores for **Sight**, **Hearing**, and **Smell**.
These are all 10 (average) unless otherwise noted,
so they usually don't need to be written down.

> Note that Smell includes the sense of taste.

Non-player characters (NPCs) may have three extra traits:

- **Courage**: how brave the character is.

- **Honesty**: how likely the character is to tell the truth.

- **Intelligence**: ability to solve puzzles, do arithmetic, etc.

Player characters (PCs) don't have scores for these
because it's up to the player to be brave,
to tell the truth (or not),
and to solve puzzles.
NPCs only need to be given scores for these traits
when it's important to the game.

## Species

Each species of animal character has its own "normal" Size and Coordination scores,
but all of them have an average Health of 10,
and all of them use the same formula for calculating Strength.

| Species   | Size | Coordination | Senses                  | Special            |
| --------- | ---: | -----------: | ----------------------: | ------------------ |
| bear      |  13  |            8 | Sight=8,<br>Smell=12    |                    |
| bison     |  12  |            9 | Sight=9                 | horns              |
| elephant  |  14  |            8 | Sight=9                 | prehensile trunk   |
| fox       |   6  |           12 | Smell=12                |                    |
| goat      |   7  |           10 |                         | horns              |
| kangaroo  |  10  |           10 | Smell=11                | leaping            |
| lion      |  10  |           12 | Smell=12,<br>Hearing=11 | carnivore          |
| monkey    |   8  |           13 |                         | prehensile tail    |
| rabbit    |   5  |           12 | Smell=12,<br>Hearing=11 | may go berserk     |
| raccoon   |   6  |           13 | Sight=11                |                    |
| rhino     |  13  |            8 | Sight=7,<br>Smell=11    |                    |
| tiger     |  10  |           12 | Smell=12,<br>Hearing=11 | carnivore          |
| wolf      |   9  |           11 | Smell=12                |                    |
| zebra     |  10  |           10 | Smell=11                |                    |

## Shaping

A small number of animal characters have psychic powers
that let them control the world with their mind.
Those who have one of these abilities typically start with a score of 6 or 7,
which slowly improves with practice and training.
The most common abilities are:

*  **Earth**: dirt and stone, but not refined metal.

*  **Air**: wind.

*  **Fire**: flames.

*  **Water**: only in its liquid form (not vapor or ice).

*  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.

*  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.  (Nobody can stop or reverse time, or see the future.)

*  **Dream**: dreams and feelings.

It is extremely rare for someone to be able to shape more than one element,
and no one can shape opposite elements:
Earth and Air,
Fire and Water,
Luck and Time.
(As far as anyone knows,
Dream doesn't have an opposite.)

## Bots

The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning floors to mining the ocean floor.
Since the Makers disappeared,
the bots left behind have improvised repairs however they could
to keep themselves going.
The result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike.
One might have six short legs and a pair of mis-matched claws for arms,
while another might use two rotor fans to fly,
but have only a single slender manipulator to pick things up.

Bots have Size and Coordination scores just like living characters,
but don't have Health:
they just have Strength instead.
Their Sight and Hearing scores are 10 by default,
but only a few bots have any sense of smell or taste.
(Most regard smell as slightly icky,
and would prefer that living creatures didn't talk about it so much.)

## Skills

Every character has certain skills,
which are things they're particularly good at.
Some useful skills are listed below,
and the director may allow players to add other skills to their characters.

A skill is recorded as a *bonus*:
+1 means a little knowledge or ability,
+2 is more,
and so on.
A score of 4 or more is very good,
and a score or 6 or higher is generally considered an expert.

### Example: Madica

Madica is a teenage fox girl.
She's a bit on the small side,
even for her species,
but she has worked on her parents' fishing boat every day since she was a child,
so she is quite healthy.
She has a keen nose,
and is also very good with her hands:
she's had a lot of practice tying knots and mending nets,
and her mother has taught her a few magic tricks.
She recently discovered that she can shape water a little bit,
and desperately wants to find someone to teach her how to do more.

| **Trait**     | **Score** | **Skill**     | **Score** |
| ------------- | --------: | ------------- | --------: |
| Size          |         5 | Boating       |        +3 |
| Health        |        12 | Fishing       |        +2 |
| Coordination  |        13 | Swimming      |        +4 |
| Strength      |         6 | Stage Magic   |        +2 |
| Smell         |        12 | Water Shaping |        +2 |

### Example: Rhymes With Orange

Rhymes With Orange was built to clean windows on ultra-tall skyscrapers.
It has long spidery limbs with suction cups for climbing,
but a very small body.
It also has a storage tank built into its back that can hold up to 5 liters,
and has modified the water jets on its arms to squirt almost any kind of liquid.
Rhymes With Orange's fractal battery was damaged years ago
in an accident that robbed it of most of its memories.
It can only go 9-10 days without being recharged by another bot,
so it is constantly doing odd jobs in exchange for power
or gambling to try to win a recharge.
(It only cheats when it has to.)

| Trait        | Score | **Skill**   | **Score** |
| ------------ | ----: | ----------- | --------: |
| Height       |    12 | Acrobatics  |        +5 |
| Weight       |     7 | Climbing    |        +5 |
| Coordination |    10 | Gambling    |        +4 |
| Strength     |    11 | Squirt      |        +3 |

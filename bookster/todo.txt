- Erileine: can't wait to get off the mountain at the start, feels
  superior to Fraederiq and her parents, isn't as smart as she thinks;
  by the end, realizes that this is her home and that it's worth
  fighting for. Have to have her caught out making things up at the
  start, and then admitting that she doesn't know by the end.

- Laeuc: proud of her, but treats her as a little girl at the start;
  realizes by the end that she's growing up.

- Piaerre: resents the captain, drops hints about him abandoning
  people; work in a thread about Nuu Ciy being the captain's second
  wife (the first is Avauntois, they split up, she left the mountain
  in Gandan, Piaerre is going to be put off there).

- Have Razi make regular trips to the Forecastle (discover then that
  he's training Piaerre each time he goes).

- When they're flying the first time, describe the mountain peak and
  the plume of snow trailing off it.

- Bigger reveal for the captain's death and its effect on Piaerre.

- What does Piaerre do while they're flying? How does his part of the
  story end?

- Make sure to mention Jaromir's long sleeveless coat.

- Jaromir has to be in the scene at the end.

- Describe the layout at the peak better so that when Razi is thrown
  over the side, it makes sense.

- Erileine's numb hand has to matter in the end: allows her to grasp
  the Pilot Stone when others can't.

- They are attacked by a bonescuttle underground.

- Have Vurt grumble that the skull of the first bonescuttle he killed
  was bigger.

- Why are the Avauntois able to go into the tunnels at the end when
  they were so afraid earlier in Vurt's story?

- The next morning, many of the Hett are gone (including
  Jaromir). Erileine asks what's happening; the woman who is now in
  command (the one who he remembers spying) tells him brusquely that
  they were needed elsewhere to clear land. This starts a swirl of
  rumors among the Avauntois: are the Hett planning to build their own
  villages, rather than force the Avauntois out? How will the mountain
  sustain them? (The last only works if I've already had people
  discuss the fact that the mountain is slowly running out of
  topsoil---I need this to foreshadow key elements of the sequel.)

- Thomas must knock on the door of every room he enters.

- Explain naming days: the person is given back their name on the
  anniversary of their birth each year; the ceremony takes place next
  to the tree planted when they're born.

- Use the farewell, "Shalma'a," several more times in the story.

- Dogs are extinct in modern times (after a magical plague two
  centuries ago). This is why people say things like, "You look like
  you've seen a dog!" Not relevant to this story, so take it out:
  replace with things like, "You look like you were just kissed by a
  ghost!"

- They should swear by the death of all dogs, and by all the clocks
  that ever ticked.

- Add more (dumb) beasts: pre-modern towns and villages were full of
  domestic animals.  Use their poop to discuss the fact that the Hett
  are slowly running out of topsoil.

- A banner of snow blown off Avaunt's peak.

- Cutting and drying moss for use in the stinky house.

- A painting showing a boxer throwing the same punch forever.

- Razi: "We back into the future (must do, because we can see the past
  as we go)."

- A "saint" is a great scholar, inventor, or engineer. Saint
  Bearnard's Bridge, Saint Ehrm's balm, etc.

- Que√ßenne talking about Vurt and Mayeule: old people get cute as they
  shrivel up.

- Spitting seeds over the balcony, watching the cat run up to each one
  in turn to sniff it.

- "The problem with books is that they can't change their minds."

- The hurt you get in the back of your throat when you're trying to
  stop yourself from crying.

- Feeding dyed grain to chickens to make them lay colored eggs (a
  story Laeuc told Erileine when she was young; Erileine still has the
  egg).

- "That's like asking which side of a coin is the 'real' one." (Razi
  talking about who's right and who's wrong.)

- Jack the Parrot threatening to cake on someone's head. (Use "cake"
  more frequently, and have Piaerre get in trouble for using it.)

- Mention somewhere that the mountain affects the weather around it
  (but less than the Avauntois think).

- "First, lie my Razi on his back." Why can she see him now, when she
  couldn't see him when Erileine spoke to her the first time?

- "...and grabbed the window ledge." She needs to be clumsy here: she's
  still adjusting to her numb hand.

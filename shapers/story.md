## Quotes

"Because there used to be a rusty bridge here," Dickety said slowly.
"We tried to repair it but we did not have parts."
Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think.
"Searching...
Yes.
It fell down.
I remember."

"My grandmother is barely out of her egg when it happens,"
Sensei Reed confirmed in a slow whisper.
"It is winter.
There is a terrible storm,
much wind,
much ice.
When the bridge comes crashing down,
people say,
the Makers are angry,
we should leave this place,
but others say no,
this is our home,
we will make our own bridge."

"Because if we clean up this mess and put things back the way they were
then the Makers will come back and everything will be *better*,"
Tasercase hissed.
"No more rust.
No more oh, I regret, we do not have that part."
It waved its mis-matched manipulators for emphasis.

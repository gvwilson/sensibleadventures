# The Cloudherd and the Tiger's Boy<br>Greg Wilson

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight thousand
gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to west.  Its single
continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer shore, the
Worldrim, rises up to cradle that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a
drop of water in her hand.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well.
Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a war that scarred the moon and
turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass.  When it was over the Pilots were
gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.*

*Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the
endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms.  it is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot,
1272, and a girl who is no longer a child but not quite yet a woman is crouched
on a cloud, chilled to the bone and desperately hoping that they're not too
late...*

"Hold on!" Grappa Gas bellowed.  "It's going to get bumpy!"

Noxy dropped to one knee, pulled the glove off her left hand, and pressed her
palm against the cloud beneath her.  She could mind-hear Big Blue's
determination, but the cloud was old, older even than Grappa Gas, and they were
flying straight into a headwind.

*Faster!* she urged.  *Please, faster!* She shivered despite her yakskin hat and
coat, her hand already numbed by the icy mountain air.

Up ahead, a makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose like an
island out of the forest.  A dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire.
Shading her eyes with her right hand, Noxy saw that the soldiers had formed a
circle around it.  Their kilts and sturdy boots were travel-stained, and their
battle masks and lacquered leather armor were scarred from fighting.  Some had
swords in their hands, while others held spears or bows.  Big Blue's mate Pillow
floated above them, her sides rippling as she struggled to keep station in the
wind, but the soldiers weren't looking at the clouds.  They were looking at the
trees around them, waiting for the forest to attack.

"You're coming in too low!" Granna Fee yelled.  Noxy's grandmother lay full
length on Big Blue, propped up on her elbows with a pair of binoculars in her
hands.  "Level him off!"

"There's no time!" Grappa Gas yelled back, his red-and-yellow scarf flapping
madly behind him.  "We have to do a dumble!"  The old man closed his eyes.  His
lips moved as he mind-spoke commands to the cloud beneath him.  Noxy mind-heard
the old bull protest, but even as he grumbled he bunched up and went into a
steep dive.

Noxy had just a moment to think, *I'd be grounded for a month if I even thought
about trying something like this,* and then the cloud thudded against the side
of the peak like a sack full of wet wool.  Nox yelped and sprawled forward to
land in an untidy heap beside Granna Fee.  "Sorry!" she said, but her
grandmother was already up, swaying to keep her balance as the cloud scraped
across bare rock, flattened two tents, and came to a halt.

"What are you waiting for!?" Granna Fee shouted at the soldiers, sliding down
Big Blue's flank and waving her arm as if to sweep them all onto the cloud.
"Get on! Get on!"

As Noxy scrambled to her feet, Grappa Gas caught her arm.  "I'll help 'em up.
You stay here and keep Blue together."  Without waiting for her to answer he
stumped forward, his peg leg leaving dimples in the cloud.  "And keep an eye out
for squirrels!" he added over his shoulder.

Noxy glanced back just in time to see something big and brown swing between two
trees below them.  Another hairy shape followed it, then another, and suddenly
the trees were full of them, hooting and shaking the branches.

"Grappa!  Grappa, there's trolls!" she shouted.

"I see 'em!" the old man shouted back.

"And bears!" Noxy added as a brown bear charged out of the trees and reared up
on its hind legs with a roar.  The muscles under its thick fur bunched as it
dropped back to all fours to charge forward a few steps, halt, and roar again.

"'Course there's bears," Grappa Gas grunted as he clasped hands with the nearest
soldier and helped him scramble up onto the cloud.  A second soldier tossed his
spear aside and pulled himself up beside the first.  Together, they reached back
and hauled up a third man while Grappa Gas reached for a fourth.

But instead of grabbing the cloudherd's hand, the man on the ground lifted a
heavy canvas-wrapped bundle.  "Never mind that, get yourself up here!" Grappa
Gas ordered.

"We'll not leaving these!" the man on the ground yelled back.  One of the
soldiers already on the cloud shouldered Grappa Gas aside, grabbed a corner of
the canvas, and tried to drag it onto the cloud.  His legs sank halfway to his
knees with the weight.

Noxy felt Big Blue shudder underneath her.  She dropped to her knees and pressed
her hand against the cloud once again.  *Just a little longer,* she pleaded,
trying to squelch her fear so that he couldn't mind-hear it.  *Stay bunched up
just a little longer.* She pictured the cloud pulling itself into a dense blob.
Obediently the cloud began to contract.

But even as it did so, Noxy heard a shrill warning whistle from the cloudherds
on board Pillow high above them.  Cold fear jellied in her gut as the trolls
suddenly stopped hooting.

"Grappa---" she started to say.

"I heard it!" Grappa Gas snapped.  Cursing, he yanked another soldier up onto
the cloud.  Half a dozen of the canvas-wrapped bundles now lay together in a
pile surrounded by twice that many men.  "Spread yourselves out, you numbskulls!
Come on, Fee, we gotta fly!"

Noxy's grandmother clambered up Big Blue's flank with a speed born from decades
of practice.  "Now or never!" she yelled at the soldier who had been lifting up
the bundles.  He sheathed his sword and grabbed a handful of cloud just as a
swarm of squirrels burst out of the forest and surged up the rocky slope like an
angry chattering wave.

*Up!* Noxy mind-yelled at Big Blue.  The cloud heaved himself into the air,
throwing the soldiers off balance.  As they toppled over she heard Grappa Gas
shout, "Hold on!"

The last soldier clung desperately to Big Blue as the cloud's flank squished
between his fingers like soggy dough.  The oncoming squirrels jumped at his
legs.  One managed to catch hold of his boot, scramble up the laces, and sink
its teeth into his calf.  The soldier cursed and kicked it off.  With a last
desperate lunge he managed to catch hold of Grappa Gas's hand.

"You idiot!" Grappa Gas yelled as he pulled the soldier up onto Big Blue's back.
"You saints-be-damned *idiot*!  They woulda stripped you down to your bones
faster'n you can peel an apple!  What was so weeping important that you couldn't
just leave it?"  He kicked one of the bundles at his feet.  "Eh?  What was
so---urp!"

In one smooth motion the soldier had rolled onto his feet, stood up, and grabbed
a handful of Grappa Gas's collar.  "With respect, honored, I'm grateful for the
rescue, but that's one of my men you're kicking, and I'll be thanking you to
stop."

He let go of Grappa Gas's coat.  The cloudherd coughed.  "Ah.  Sorry, lad.  I
didn't realize.  I'm sorry."

The soldier nodded.  "Me too."  He looked back at the patch of rock, where the
swarm of squirrels had already torn the tents to pieces.  "Me too."

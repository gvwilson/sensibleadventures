## Prolog

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, its single
continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer
shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet speck of life as a
child might cup a drop of water in her hand.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as
well.  Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a century-long
Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of
glass, and littered the land with strange magic.  When it was over the
Pilots were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.*

*Now look there, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless
squabbles of the Ninety-Nine Kingdoms.  A girl is doing her chores.
No longer a child but not yet an adult, she has no idea that her world
is about to change forever...*

----------------------------------------

## Chapter 1

Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale.
Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a
clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked between the
twisted mountain pines.

"Shoo."  She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick.  It waved
its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away.  Noxy cut
the anchor threads of its with two practiced twists of her knife and
began winding it onto a stick.

"Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?" Sensy asked,
pulling a branch aside to see if another web lay beneath it.

Noxy glanced at her.  "Why? Are those ones coming loose?"

Sensy looked down at her soft brown yakskin coat critically.  "No.
They're just kind of plain."  She sighed wistfully.  "Granna Fee has
some really nice red ones.  She said she'd give them to me if I weeded
her pepper garden."

"Her whole garden?"  Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web and
stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder.
"That's a lot of work for some buttons you don't really need."

"Oh, you're no help," Sensy pouted.  She had spent the winter
embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar.
All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes and her
hair and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't
possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale.  Especially
Rash---practically *anyone* would be more fun to be around than Rash.

"A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes," Granna Fee
had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who
seemed to have taken her best friend's place.

"Not me!" Noxy had declared.

Granna Fee had laughed and ruffled her granddaughter's hair.  "No,
daffodil, not you."

Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted,
"Soldiers! Soldiers!"

"Oh, great," she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy.  The whole point
of going out to collect spiderwebs that morning had been to get *away*
from the younger children for a few hours.

Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked
himself up and ran to the two girls.  "There's soldiers in the
village!" he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve.  "And
they've been fighting!  And there's a *tiger* with them!"

"Sure," Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away.  "And there's a
dragon under your bed."  The pass below Stale were still blanketed in
snow.  Avalanches happened almost every day---someone would have to be
foolish *and* desperate to be on the road this early in the spring.

"But there *are*!" Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to
another with excitement.  "They've got swords, and some of them are
bleeding!  And the tiger can *talk*!"

Noxy opened her mouth to say, "Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?"
but a deep *doom doom* cut her off.  She and Sensy looked at each
other wide-eyed.  *Doom doom*, pause.  *Doom doom*, pause.  It was
Stale's home drum.  It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had
wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed
help to find their way home.  It meant trouble.

Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch.  "Come on!" she told Sensy,
setting off at a run.

"I told you!" Young Gas shouted behind them. "I told you there
was---hey, wait for me!"

Patches of ice made the path slippery underfoot, but Noxy didn't slow
down until she reached the ridge overlooking the village.  There, in a
clearing left by a long-ago lighting strike, she paused to catch her
breath.

The ancient walls of the fortress of Stale lay below her.  Rain and
snow had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look
like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as
solid as the mountains themselves.

The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the walls like
ducklings in a nest.  Thin wisps of smoke rose from their slate
chimneys, while vegetable plots and racks of drying spiderwebs filled
the spaces between them.

To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.  A
net woven from squirrel spiders' webs was stretched over its top, as
light as a dream but as strong as steel.  Another net hung down at the
gorge's mouth to make a gate.  Inside, just visible from the ridge,
two gray clouds drifted half-asleep.

Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds,
riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them.
Grownups called the pair slow and lazy, but they were the most
exciting things in Noxy's world---except, of course, for the herd of
half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance.

Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her hand.  "Wait!"
she hissed, pointing into the trees.  For a moment all Noxy saw was
branches.  Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and suddenly she could
make out a hairy form in the trees.

Noxy's mouth went dry.  She felt Sensy squeezed her hand, and squeezed
back.  As long as they didn't startle it...

Little Gas burst out of the bushes behind them and ran headlong into
Noxy.  "Oof!" he exclaimed, "What are you---mmph!"

"Sh!" Noxy whispered urgently, her hand clamped over his mouth.
"Don't... move..."

Before Young Gas could protest, the troll stepped into the clearing.
His fur was silvered with age, and his eyes seemed as old as the
mountains themselves.  He and Noxy stared at each other for one long
moment before he leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up
into the tree.  After one last look, he disappeared into the greenery.

Sensy was the first to speak.  "Wh-what's a troll doing *here*?" she
asked shakily, still holding Noxy's hand.

Noxy shook her head.  "Worry about that later.  Come on!"

The drum had stopped booming by the time the children reached the
fortress wall.  An enormous stone door stood half-open at the
entrance, its iron hinges melted in some long-ago battle.  The wooden
gate that Stale's current human inhabitants had built to fill the gap
was made of whole tree trunks, but still looked like a child's toy
next to the Pilots' ancient work.

Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the main
square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who
had left a week ago to collect Stale's clouds from their wintering
grounds in the high peaks.  Three hundred people were there, from
babies in their mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, all in an
uncertain muttering half-circle.

A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front of them.  Each one had a
battle mask painted with fierce swirls of red and black pushed up on
top of his head.  Leather armor, as thick as bootsoles and studded
with metal, protected their bodies, while heavy wool kilts reached
from their waists to their knees.  Some had swords in scabbards on
their hips, while others had bows or spears, but each had a heavy pack
on his back.

And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting.  One man's hand
was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling.
None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard
faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.

But Noxy didn't see any of that right away.  What she saw instead was
the tiger.  His stripes were dark brown on tan, not black on orange
like the picture in the story book that three generations of village
children had passed from hand to hand.  A pair of golden earrings hung
from his left ear, and his tail twitched now and again as if the
villagers' murmurs reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.

A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack
as large as any of theirs.  Four half-healed scars ran across his
cheek, glistening redly against his near-black skin.  His back was
straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was from cold,
weariness, or fear, Noxy couldn't tell.

Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve.  "Who *are* they?"

"Sh!" Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know.
"I'm trying to hear!"

Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and
stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the
square.  "Friends," she said in what Noxy thought of as her official
voice, "Friends, please.  I know it is early in the year for
travellers, but please greet Sergeant Dorbu and the Gifted Kulbinder."

The soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers.  The
tiger merely blinked.  "They and their companions will be our guests
for the next little while," Indy continued.  "I trust you will all
make them welcome."

"How long's a little while?" Grappa Gas asked loudly.  Noxy saw her
mother wince.  Everyone loved Grappa Gas---or nearly everyone---but as
Granna Fee said, sometimes he had the manners of a constipated yak.

"Until they are ready to travel again," Indy reassured him.  Her eyes
swept across the crowd.  "Their journey has been a hard one---they
hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans.
Sergeant?  Would you like to say a few words?"

The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as
Indy stepped down.  Like his men, his skin was black compared to the
villagers' brown, and his head was fuzzy with wiry stubble.  The two
yellow ribbons around his sleeve were the only sign of his rank.

Before he could open his mouth, Grappa Gas asked, "So, are you lot
loyalists or rebels?"

"I'm sure he'll tell us if you give him a chance to speak!"  Heads
turned as a burly man, all shoulders and scowl, pushed to the front of
the crowd.

"Uh oh," Noxy said under her breath.  Grappa Gas's son Aft was the
best cloudherd in Stale, at least in his own estimation.  After one
too many arguments over plans for the summer cloud drive, Indy had
ordered him to stay behind and mend equipment instead of going with
the other adults.  Grappa Gas had happily taken the mayor's side, and
father and son had been squabbling non-stop ever since.

"Um, thank you, honored," the soldier said.  "And thank you, people of
Stale.  As your mayor said, my comrades and I were trying to see if
the pass was clear so that we could carry news to Chaghan.  We---" He
paused, and for a moment Noxy could see how exhausted he was.  "There
was an avalanche.  Three days ago.  It drove those of us who survived
off the road into the forest.  Everything seemed all right at first,
but then the forest took offence and..."  He shrugged.  "Well, you can
guess what happened next."

The villagers murmured.  The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso
Mountains from Uws in the south to Garheim's frigid shores in the
north.  It didn't hate humans the way the Jungle of Thind did, but it
guarded its territory as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs.
Gifted creatures that wanted to live in the forest did so on
sufferance, while humans were not welcome at all, not unless they
stuck to the handful of roads built long ago by the Pilots.
Travellers who strayed off them were rarely given warnings, and
*never* given second chances.

A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he
continued.  "We finally made it back to the road, but the worst of our
wounded couldn't go any further, so we left them in camp with a few of
the able-bodied and came here for help."  All traces of his earlier
smile were gone.  "That was the day before last.  I pray they're still
all right, but if they are, they won't be for much longer."

Grappa Gas broke the silence that followed.  "So which side *are* you
on?" he asked, his voice still loud but a notch less rude.

"I have the privilege of serving Respected Shudarga in this matter,"
Sergeant Dorbu answered calmly.

A handful of elders gasped at the rebel leader's name, but Aft crossed
his arms and nodded approvingly.  "Good for you!" he said firmly, his
glare daring his father to disagree.

Grappa Gas thumped his wooden leg loudly on the cobblestones.  "Good
for them, maybe, but what about us?  If the king's men come looking
for you, these walls won't keep them out for long."

"Quiet, both of you!" Indy said sharply.  She was a head shorter than
either of the men, but the iron in her voice left no room for
argument.  She nodded at the sergeant.  "Please, go ahead."

The sergeants shook his head.  "We didn't choose Stale for its walls,
honored.  We didn't really choose it at all.  We just washed up here
because we need help.  If you're afraid that'll bring trouble, we'll
understand if you send us on our way."

"Nobody is sending anyone away," Indy said firmly.  "We may not have
as much as some, but we take pride in our hospitality.  I'm sure we
can find some spare blankets to keep you warm and something better
than hardtack to feed you for as long as you need to stay."

"Thank you, honored," the sergeant said.  "But what we really want is
a couple of clouds so that we can go and rescue our friends."

----------------------------------------

## Chapter 2

The next five minutes were chaos.  Out of the question, Grappa Gas
said, whacking his wooden leg with his cane for emphasis.  The king's
law might overlook them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who
wandered in out of the cold, but flying off to rescue their friends?
Why, when the *tralpa* came back---

---they'd show him the gate and send him on his way, Aft cut in, arms
crossed and brows knotted.  The lazy good-for-nothing had run for the
capital the moment word of the rebellion had reached the mountains,
and hadn't been seen since.  As far as Aft was concerned, he'd given
up any right he ever had to tell people what the law was or wasn't.
And anyway, if they were going to shelter rebels, it wouldn't matter
if they'd come to Stale or Stale had gone to them.  And anyway again,
what would folk in other villages say if they heard that Stalers had
left men in the forest to die?  Saints, what would their own folk say
when they got back?

The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones.  Little
whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart
as people disagreed with their neighbors, or turned around to agree
with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet another
"what if?"

"This is going to go on forever," Noxy sighed.  She and Sensy had
stayed aloof on the sidelines, old enough to want to be part of the
grownup discussion, but young enough that the whole thing seemed
vaguely ridiculous.

"It's so stupid," Sensy agreed.  "I mean, they're all going to wind up
doing whatever your mother wants them to."

"Unless they get eaten by a *tiger*!"  The two girls shrieked and
jumped as sharp fingers poked them in the ribs.

"Rash!  Don't!"  Sensy punched the smirking boy in the arm.  "I *hate*
it when you sneak up on me!"

"I know," Rash smirked, running a thumb over the lip fuzz he insisted
on calling a mustache.  It had become a habit over the winter, one
that Noxy had told him countless times he ought to break before
*someone* broke his stupid finger.  "But it's better than being eaten,
isn't it?"

"The tiger's not going to eat anyone, you big yak," Noxy said as
scornfully as she could, her heart still racing.

"How do you know?  He looks awfully hungry to me."  Rash licked his
lips and growled.  "Mmm... tasty, tasty human."

"Stop it," Sensy said, punching his arm again.  "I mean it."

"Ow."  Rash rubbed his arm, looking genuinely surprised at the force
of Sensy's blow.  "I'm just kidding."

"Well, it's not funny," Sensy grumbled, hugging herself.  Stale's
walls sheltered the square from the mountain winds, but the air was
still cold.

"Anyway," Rash said, not quite rolling his eyes, "What I want to know
is, do we get to go on this rescue mission, or are we going to be
stuck here with the littles again."

"Of course we'll get to go!" Noxy exclaimed.

"Really?"  Rash ran his thumb over his mustache again.  "Then why
isn't anyone ordering us around?"

Noxy opened her mouth, closed it, then grunted, "Wait here."

She strode toward the center of the square where her mother was
speaking with the sergeant.  The tiger sat impassively on his haunches
next to them, twitching his tail at every sudden sound.  The boy with
the scarred face stood beside him.  His face was beyond exhausted, but
when his shoulders started to droop, the tiger growled quietly and he
snapped to attention again.

Noxy's mother caught sight of her.  "Oh, and this is my daughter,
Probably Noxious."

"Honored Noxious."  The sergeant bowed slightly.

Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was
immediately annoyed at herself.  Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a
silly lowlander custom.  "Just call me Noxy," she told him.  "*Amma*,
which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on?  We can go and start
getting them ready while everyone's jawing."

Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well.  "Who said
anything about you three going?"

But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and
had already assembled her arguments.  They were definitely old
enough---why, they were all going to be riding *real* clouds in a few
weeks, not just tame old pair floating about in the cloud pen.  And
they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down the pass, and it
was really important for cloudherds to know how to do rescues, wasn't
it?  And---

"Stop."  Her mother held up a hand.  "You can go.  But!" she
continued, "But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna Fee, and that's
all you do---ride.  Understood?"

Noxy nodded, trying and failing to suppress a triumphant grin.  "Yes,
*amma*."  As she turned to go, she heard her mother sigh and Sergeant
Dorbu say, "My men do that to me all the time."

It only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed.
Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and more than a
few tinkers and traders had been lifted out of a difficult spot after
running into a bear or a pack of trolls.  Coils of hemp rope with
spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen,
and everyone kept an extra yakskin cap somewhere, just in case.

"You look ridiculous," Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the
wooden steps to the mounting platform.  The older men had been
teaching him how to embroider during the winter's enforced idleness,
and had stitched what he claimed were eagle's wings onto the side
flaps of his cap.

Rash looked her up and down.  "Really?  Because I think you look
amazing.  Excuse me."  He winked at Noxy and stepped around the pair
of speechless thirteen-year-old girls to take his place on the
platform.

"Ears all!" Aft called out, clapping his hands.  Despite the cold, he
only wore a sleeveless yakskin vest, knee-length wool shorts, and a
sturdy pair of boots.  His hair was braided back in a thick club with
a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven through it for
luck.  "I'm fore on Big Blue, Gas and Fee will ride spotter on Pillow.
We'll down, lift, and out, quick and simple, and get our new friends
back here for soup before you can sneeze.  No adventures, right?"  He
turned a steely glare toward Noxy, Sensy, and Rash, who nodded and
mumbled, "No adventures."

"Right!"  Without any more more ceremony than that he walked to the
end of the plank that jutted out from the platform, looked down to
check that Big Blue was below him, and jumped.

Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath.  One, two, three...
Big Blue dimpled under Aft's weight as the burly cloudherd hit him
dead center, sending gray waves rippling across the cloud's back.  Aft
rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly.  Noxy
couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in
concentration as he mind-spoke to the cloud to rouse it from its
morning doze.

Something twinged in the back of her head.  She blinked, momentarily
disoriented.  "Did you say something?" she asked her friends.

"I said, show-off," Rash replied, a note of envy in his voice.  "Look,
he's coming up."

Noxy shook her head, the strange feeling already half-forgotten as Big
Blue rose slowly toward the platform, bunching in on itself as it
came.  Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the cloud's
back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.

A silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, trilling its
startled displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away.
Aft looked up and smiled they way he only did when he was on a cloud.
"You want me to get Pillow for you?"  he called up to his father.

"No need, I can---damn that boy!"  Grappa Gas harrumphed as Aft took
three long strides across Big Blue's back and launched himself into
the air again.

Rash whistled.  "Nice leap," he said appreciatively as Aft landed with
an audible *poof!* right in the middle of Pillow.  "And blind, too."

"It's not such a trick," Noxy said dismissively, though she was
secretly impressed.  "He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she
was."

"Sure, but would you trust a cloud's directions that much?"  Rash
challenged her.  "Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out
of what they say."

Noxy shrugged.  She had realized early in their training that
mind-talking was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash,
or even for some of the olders who had been riding clouds for years.
She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of
showing off.  The only person she shared her progress with now was
Granna Fee, and even she didn't---

*Twinge.* She winced and put her hand on the back of her head.  There
it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?

This time Sensy noticed.  "Are you all right?"

"Sure," Noxy lied.  One of the few things Aft and Grappa Gas agreed on
was that cloudherds shouldn't fly if they were sick, so she wasn't
going to admit to anything that might give them an excuse to leave her
behind.

Grappa Gas pulled a small scrimshawed yak horn from the leather sheath
on his belt.  "Here," he said, handing it to Rash.  "Let's see if
you've been paying attention to your lessons."

The boy nodded and raised it to his lips to blow two long notes, *dee*
*dah*.  Big Blue obediently turned and drifted over to the platform.
As soon as he was within reach, Rash reached out and pressed his hand
against the cloud, blowing the same two notes again.  It was hard to
train a cloud to answer to sound---to anything other than
mind-speech---but it was one of the hundred skills the teens had to
master if they hoped to ride the giant creatures on their own some
day.

Aft brought Pillow up to the platform next to Big Blue and stepped off
nonchalantly.  With a mutter and a glare, Grappa Gas told the
teenagers to get on, get on, they didn't have all day.  He and Granna
Fee followed.  "Oof," Noxy's grandmother said as she sat cross-legged.
"That's not as easy as it used to be."  But then she smiled like the
girl she had once been and put her arm around Noxy.  Her granddaughter
leaned against her the way she had so many times before, wondering
when and how her grandmother had grown so small.

Behind them, Rash nudged Sensy with his elbow.  "You can lean on me if
you get cold, you know."

Sensy sniffed.  "I don't expect I'll ever get *that* cold."

Granna Fee pressed her hand against Pillow and closed her eyes.  The
cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the spiderweb gate
that hung down over mouth of the gorge.  Meanwhile, two of Stale's
other oldsters climbed aboard Big Blue.  As they took their places
behind Aft, the cloud slowly began to sink.

"Hold him there," Indy called to Aft.  She turned to Sergeant Dorbu,
who had watched Aft's jump wide-eyed.  "Go ahead---jump."

"Um..."  Sergeant Dorbu looked from the cloud to Indy and back again.
"Wouldn't it have been simpler for me just to climb on like everyone
else?"

"Absolutely," Indy said.  "But everyone has to jump their first time.
For luck," she added cheerfully.

"If you say so, honored," the sergeant replied dubiously.  He reached
up to pull his battle mask down over his face, caught himself at the
last moment, took a deep breath, and jumped.

*Poof!* *Poof!* *Poof!* He and the two lowland soldiers he had picked
to go with him hit the cloud feet-first and immediately toppled over.

"Mind yourself, he's a bit slippery," Aft said as the sergeant and his
men struggled unsuccessfully to stand.  "Probably best if you just
sit.  You'll spook him if you keep tumbling about like that."

"Ready?" Granna Fee called from Pillow's back.  Without waiting for an
answer, she turned the cloud toward the cloud pen's gate, muttering
softly as she mind-spoke her orders.

Cloudherding is cold work.  In the spring, in the mountains, when
breath still fogs at mid-day and the wind pokes its fingers through
every loose seam and down every collar, it's beyond freezing.  A
hundred heartbeats after they left the cloud pen, Granna Fee had
wrapped a fleece around herself and Noxy, leaving only their faces
exposed.  Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy said, he might
be a yak, but at least he was a *warm* yak.

Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected.  "Saints and their inventions, but
I miss this," he sighed.  He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden
leg on so that it wouldn't poke into Pillow, but was dressed in the
same long coat and scarf that he had been wearing when the soldiers
arrived.  "Look, the condors are back in their nest!  We should invite
them them to visit some time."

"They're not really the most sociable of creatures," Granna Fee said
dryly.

Grappa Gas harrumphed.  "You just have to get to know them."

"Do you think they'd want to meet the tiger?" Noxy asked.  "I mean,
another Gifted might..."  She trailed off.

"Let's worry about today before we start making social arrangements,"
Granna Fee said.

It had taken Sergeant Dorbu and his men a day to hike up the pass to
Stale Leftovers.  The clouds covered the same distance in less than an
hour, even with the headwind.  "There," Granna Fee said, pointing at a
thin plume of smoke.

Grappa Gas frowned.  "I thought he said there were just a few of
them."

Granna Fee frowned too.  "Maybe 'a few' means something different to
lowlanders."

The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren outcrop of rock that rose
out of the forest like an island.  Two dozen drab gray tents huddled
around a small fire.  Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw a
handful of men moving about, some propped against one another to stay
upright.

Grappa Gas gave a low whistle.  "Aft's not going to like this."

"Neither is my daughter," Granna Fee replied darkly.

One of the injured soldiers spotted the clouds a moment later.  The
cloudherds were too far away to hear his shouts, but there was no
mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms.  Other soldiers
crawled out of their tents and began waving and shouting as well as
Aft steered Big Blue in a long arc to the upwind side of the outcrop.
After a brief argument conducted via tooted horns, Granna Fee had
Pillow hover directly above the camp.

"You lot keep your eyes wide," Grappa Gas ordered the teenagers
curtly.  "Forest might be happy to let us take them, or it might not."

Big Blue descended until he bumped against the edge of the outcrop,
his back level with its top.  The older cloudherds riding with Aft
stayed on board while he strode forward, barking orders to hurry the
soldiers along.  Only a few windborne words reached Noxy, but that was
enough for her to know that he was telling the injured men to leave
their gear, to leave their tents, to leave everything they couldn't
pick up *right away*.

In singles and pairs, the men struggled to clamber onto Big Blue's
back.  A few wore their battle masks, but most had tied them out of
the way on the backs of their helmets.  It made them look like a doll
Noxy had once seen with one happy face and one sad, except the
soldiers' looked fierce and weary.

The older cloudherds helped drag the worst of the injured onto the
cloud, spacing the soldiers out to keep their weight balanced.
Meanwhile, a soldier began arguing with Aft, pointing at a large tent
standing a short distance away from the others.  Other soldiers joined
in, until Aft was facing a half-circle of angry men.

Finally he threw up his hands in surrender.  Noxy couldn't hear what
he said, but half a dozen men broke away from the group and hurried as
best they could toward the tent.  As their comrades climbed onto
Pillow, Aft made sweeping motions with his arm and pointed at the
outcrop.

"No no no," Grappa Gas muttered.  "You can take them all, lad, just
get them loaded up and get out of there."

"What?  What's happening?" Noxy asked.

"Butter-brain wants us to come in and load the rest," Grappa Gas said
angrily.  "But look---over there!"

Something brown moved behind the trees a dozen strides from the lower
edge of the outcrop.  Something else---something larger---briefly let
itself be seen a few strides further away.  In singles and pairs and
packs, the forest was mustering.

Grappa Gas spat over Pillow's side.  "They're holding back for now,"
he said.  "But if we go in, they'll be on us like an avalanche."

"It's not your decision to make," Granna Fee told him.  "Aft's riding
fore on this one, and---"

"---and you follow your fore.  I know, I know.  Saints."  Grappa Gas
looked like he wanted to spit again.

Granna Fee pressed her palm into Pillow's back and closed her eyes.
The cloud began to descend.

Grappa Gas glared at the three teenagers.  "You see something, you
shout, got it?"

"Yes, grappa," Noxy said.  Rash and Sensy just nodded.

Ten heartbeats, twenty... They were level with the camp.  Granna Fee
halted their descent long enough for Pillow to lift off and drift out
of their way.  "Hurry up!" Grappa Gas shouted, waving urgently.

The soldiers who had gone back to the large tent struggled toward the
cloud, each with a heavy canvas-wrapped bundle on his shoulder.  As
they made their way through the camp, a cougar stepped out of the
trees.  Catching sight of it, the soldier at the end of the line
snatched a branch out of the fire and waved it, shouting, "Hah! Get
back! Hah!"

"Oh no," Granna Fee breathed.  Beside her, Grappa Gas swore fiercely
and yanked his slingshot out of his belt.  In one smooth motion he
folded its brace down against his forearm, pulled a water-smoothed
rock from his pocket, drew, aimed, and fired.

*Thwack!* Even from thirty strides away, Noxy heard the stone strike
the branch and send it flying.  "Run, you idiot, run!"  Grappa Gas
shouted.

It was too late.  The forest was awake, and angry.  Sensy shrieked as
a brown bear charged out of the trees to rear up on its hind legs and
roar, "Get them!"  Another bear joined it, then a cougar, and then the
trees were boiling with trolls, dozens of them, hooting and shaking
branches until it looked like the trees were trying to uproot
themselves.

"Get them!" the Gifted bear roared again, and the animals charged.
Bears and cougars, a snarling wolverine, trolls on all fours with
their teeth bared, all came roaring and snarling and hooting through
the camp, the Gifted and the ordinary side by side, their own feuds
forgotten because someone had raised fire against the forest.

The first of the soldiers fell to one knee, dragged himself back to
his feet, and fell forward onto Pillow's flank.  "I've got you!" Rash
shouted, dragging the bundle and then the soldier up onto the cloud.
Another, a third, a fourth, a fifth---

"Look out!" Noxy shouted at the last soldier as a cougar snarled and
launched itself at him.  The soldier spun around and flung up his hand
as if to signal *stop!*

The cougar crumpled mid-air and fell to the ground as though it had
hit an invisible wall.  The soldier doubled over to vomit, then
stumbled the last half dozen steps to the cloud.  Rash and Sensy
grabbed his bundle.  Noxy took his hand.  "Go! Go! Go!" she shouted.

Pillow pulled herself into the air.  A second cougar made a leap for
the soldier's dangling legs and snarled with rage as it missed them by
a handspan.  Noxy felt herself slipping under the soldier's weight,
but strong hands grabbed her shoulders.  Together, Grappa Gas and Rash
pulled her and the soldier onto the cloud.

Noxy rolled over and stood up.  "That was close," she said shakily.

"Too close.  Too *damned* close!"  Grappa Gas rounded on the soldier
he had saved.  "We could have been dinner, all of us, and for what?"
He whacked the long bundle beside the soldier with his cane.

The soldier surged to his feet and caught the old cloudherd's arm.
"Stop."  His voice was as cold as ice fields beneath them.

Grappa Gas tried to pull his arm free, but the soldier's grip was like
iron.  "Well that's a mess of a thank you!" he said angrily.

The soldier released him.  "My apologies.  And thank you."  He swept
his gaze across everyone on the cloud.  "Thank you all."

"Hmph."  Grappa Gas scowled at the impassive soldier.  "What was so
aching important you just couldn't leave it behind?"

"My men."  The soldier nodded toward the bundle at his feet, his face
set.  "I promised them we would give them a proper farewell."

Half a dozen expressions flitted across Grappa Gas's face as he
realized what their cargo was.  "Ah.  Sorry, lad.  I'm sorry."  He
hesitated.  "And that magic you did---I hope it didn't cost more than
you can afford."

The soldier glanced over his shoulder.  Behind them, the forest
creatures were tearing every man-made thing in the camp to pieces.
"It doesn't matter.  All that matters is that my men are safe."

"Safe as houses, honored," one of the men beside Noxy said, his accent
as burred as any cloudherd's.  "And don't worry.  Stale's folk will
give your dead a proper send-off."

Grappa Gas spun around.  "You! What are *you* doing here?"

The man who had spoken wiped a his nose on his arm, leaving a long
streak of nose drool on his sleeve.  "Flying, by the looks of it.
Hey, Fee!"  He patted the cloud.  "Mind if I take over for a bit?"

----------------------------------------

## Chapter 3

Later, in the diary she kept hidden under her mattress even though she
knew her mother knew about it, Noxy wrote, "There was a lot of
shouting after that."  Grappa Gas did a lot of it, just like always,
but Granna Fee was almost incandescent.  That man was *not* going to
Stale.  As a matter of fact, the only place he was going was off her
cloud, right now, and the drop be damned.

"Because he's been shunned!" she said icily to the soldier who had
been last to board---who, it turned out, was the troop's commander.
"He's never to speak to a cloudherd, never to set foot in our
villages, and never, *ever* to ride a cloud again."

As weak as he obviously was, the commander didn't flinch under Granna
Fee's fury.  "We needed a guide.  He was the only one we could find."

"Would have been better off wandering around in circles than following
the likes of him," Grappa Gas said darkly.

The commander looked down at the canvas-wrapped body at his feet.
"Perhaps.  But what's done is done."

Nobody said anything after that.  Grappa Gas sat shoulder-to-shoulder
with Granna Fee, each apparently trying to out-scowl the other.  Noxy,
Rash, and Sensy huddled together in a vain attempt to keep warm.  The
commander sat next to the grimy ex-cloudherd and watched the mountains
slide past, while the soldiers did what soldiers always do when they
have a moment of peace: they fell asleep.  One started to snore,
stopping only when the commander nudged him with his boot.

With her hand on Pillow's back, Noxy could feel how unhappy the cloud
was.  It wasn't just that she was carrying strangers, or that those
strangers were bleeding and miserable.  When clouds died, they just
spread out into nothing.  The thought that something could end but
still be there---that it could go from being alive to being like a
rock or a log---made the canvas-wrapped bodies more frightening than
storm winds and lightning combined.

*Sh, sh, sh,* Noxy mind-spoke soothingly, stroking the cloud as if she
was an overgrown house cat.  *Home soon, then rest.* At that moment,
she wanted it just as much as the cloud.

Aft brought Big Blue down in the clearing in front of the fortress
gate.  An ankle-high carpet of ferns and spring-green shoots bent
under the cloud's weight as he settled into place.  The waiting
villagers helped the wounded soldiers to the ground and handed them
heavy blankets and steaming bowls of sweet dark tea.

Aft slid down Big Blue's flank and strode across the clearing to Indy.
Noxy was too far away to hear what he said, but from the angry way he
waved his arms and the way her mother rounded on Sergeant Dorbu, she
could imagine the conversation.  Even more soldiers?  And the forest
had attacked?  This was more than Stale had bargained for---a lot
more.

"Hasn't fallen down yet," the rescued mountaineer said, wiping his
nose on his sleeve again to punctuate his disappointment.

"Stow it, Yestevan," Grappa Gas growled.  "I hear another word out of
you, and I'll put you over the side."

A cold shiver ran up Noxy's back.  She and Sensy exchanged wide-eyed
looks.  People weren't supposed to talk about someone who had been
shunned, but older children had whispered this one when grownups
weren't around.

Yestevan just grinned at Grappa Gas, then winked at the two girls when
he saw they were looking at him.  Noxy glared in return, while Sensy
huddled closer to Rash, not seeming to mind the protective arm he put
around her.

"Look---there's the tiger," Rash said, pointing.

Noxy shaded her eyes with her hand.  Kulbinder was sitting on his
haunches on the parapet of the wall above them, watching the second
cloud come in with the same unimpressed expression that cats
everywhere mastered long before they tamed human beings.  His boy
stood beside him, leaning forward to look down at the clearing.  As
Noxy watched, the tiger hopped down off the parapet, disappearing from
view with his boy behind him.

Grappa Gas glanced at Noxy.  "Your *amma* isn't going to like this.
Any of this."

"Sh." Granna Fee waved a hand to quiet him.  "I'm trying to land."

Pillow touched down gently.  "Help the men," Grappa Gas ordered the
three teenagers.  "I'll take care of the bodies."

"I can give you a hand with that," Yestevan said, rising to his feet.

Grappa Gas held up a hand to block him.  "You stay where you are."

"Easy, old man, easy."  The former cloudherd raised his hands in mock
surrender.  "Just trying to help."  He sat down again, grinning as if
he'd just scored a point in a game no-one else was playing.

It took a few moments to slide the bodies down the cloud's flank into
the arms of the waiting soldiers.  When Indy offered to get villagers
to help, Sergeant Dorbu shook his head politely but firmly.  "These
are ours," he said firmly.  "Though we'd be grateful if you could
gather some wood for a pyre---we'd like to send them off tonight."

Whatever the mayor might have said in reply was lost as Yestevan slid
off the cloud and sketched a bow.  "Greetings, honored.  Everyone."
He straightened up and rubbed his back as if to work out the kinks.
"Long ride, that.  Glad to be back on the ground."

There was a moment of shocked silence, and then Indy said, "What are
*you* doing here?" in a bewildered voice that Noxy would never have
imagined could come out of her competent, fearless mother's mouth.

The commander's face was drawn, and beads of sweat were pearled on his
face despite the cold air, but his voice was steady.  "He is with us."

Everything seemed to happen at once after that.  Aft had been speaking
to Sergeant Dorbu.  When he heard Indy, he spun around, and when he
saw Yestevan standing there grinning, he balled his hands into fists,
took three quick steps, and threw a roundhouse punch that knocked
Yestevan flying.

Or at least he tried to.  As Aft swung, the commander swept his arm in
a perfectly-timed circle that knocked the punch to the side.  His
other arm followed the first, somehow sending Aft tumbling head over
heels onto the ground.

The tiger was there before anyone else could make sense of what had
just happened.  As Aft rolled over onto his feet, he found himself
face to face with a mouthful of very sharp teeth.  "Honored?" the
tiger rumbled.

"Let him up," the commander said.  "And then..."  With no more warning
than that, he collapsed as the willpower that had kept him on his feet
finally ran out.

Once again, everything seemed to happen at once.  Two soldiers rigged
a stretcher out of poles and blankets, lifted the commander onto it,
and followed Indy through the gate.  Granna Fee stood between Aft and
Yestevan, each glaring at the other with arms crossed, while Grappa
Gas reluctantly admitted to Sergeant Dorbu that no, the shunning
didn't extend to the forest, and yes, that meant that Yestevan could
pitch a tent there if he wanted to.  "He can make a fire too for all I
care," the old man added pointedly.  "A nice big one, right around the
oldest tree he can find."

Sergeant Dorbu beckoned to the tiger's boy.  "You, Thokmay!  Go fetch
a tent.  And a bowl of something---anything you can find."

"You're not giving him any of *our* food," Grappa Gas said hotly.

"Of course not," the sergeant replied soothingly.  "I'm giving him
some of ours."

Grappa Gas threw up his hands.  "Fine.  Come on, lad, let's get these
clouds back in their pens."  He climbed back onto Pillow, laid his
hand on the cloud's back, and lifted off.  A moment later, still
muttering, Aft guided Big Blue into the air behind him.

"Well," Noxy said awkwardly, not sure what to do next.  "I guess I'll
go see if my *amma* has any chores for me."

"If she doesn't, you can do some of mine," Rash replied, as he had a
hundred times before.  He glanced at Sensy.  "I guess we should go be
useful too."

"I guess," she said.  "See you later, Noxy."

"See you," Noxy echoed, feeling slightly bewildered as her two best
friends walked away together.

Whatever else Noxy might have thought was cut off by a now-familiar
twinge in the back of her head.  A heartbeat later she heard the
staccato blatting of Aft's horn come from the cloud pen, the quick,
angry pattern that meant "back away and give me some room".  She
caught her breath.  Grappa Gas must have been bringing Pillow in too
slowly for Aft's liking, but how could she have known that before she
heard the horn?

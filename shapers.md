*Shapers and Bots* is a fantasy role-playing game for children aged 8-80.
It is inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
countless stories of talking animals,
and my daughter.
Each game has one or more *players* and one *drudge*.
Each player takes on the role of one character,
while the drudge handles everyone else.
The drudge is often the person who created the adventure,
but not always.

## Background

Thousands of years ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals
to create dozens of new species---and then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels.
Among these are the bots:
thinking machines that were originally built for all manner of purposes,
but which are now their own masters.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you can play the part of a young half-animal adventurer,
or of a small bot that has recently become conscious
and is trying to find its place in the world.
You may choose to be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and to travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds
and whether the world is saved from an insidious peril:
the last of the Makers,
who have woken from their long sleep
and are determined to once again rule a world that is no longer theirs.

## Characters

1. Every character has three traits:

   - **Size**: how large are you?

   - **Health**: how healthy are you?

   - **Coordination**: how coordinated are you?

   An average fully-grown human has a score of 10 for each.
   Averages for other species are listed later.
   In exceptional cases,
   a character's Height and Weight may be listed separately.

2. Every living character has one extra trait that depends on these three:

   - **Strength**: how strong are you?
     A living character's Strength is equal to her Size,
     plus or minus *one* point for every *two* points her Health differs from 10.
     If a character's Height and Weight are listed separately,
     use their Weight when calculating Strength.

3. Every character also has scores for Sight, Hearing, and Smell
   (and possibly other senses for some species and bots).
   These are all 10 (average) unless otherwise noted,
   so they don't need to be written down except in special cases.
   Note that Smell includes the sense of taste.

4. Non-player characters (NPCs) may have three extra traits:

   - **Courage**: how brave the character is.

   - **Honesty**: how likely the character is to tell the truth.

   - **Intelligence**: ability to solve puzzles, do arithmetic, etc.

   Player characters (PCs) don't have scores for these
   because it's up to the player to decide when to be brave,
   when to tell truth,
   and to solve puzzles.
   NPCs only need to be given scores for these traits
   when it's important to the game.

## Species

Living characters are all part-animal.
Each species has its own "normal" Size and Coordination scores,
but all of them have an average Health of 10,
and all of them use the same formula for calculating Strength.

| Species   | Size | Coordination | Senses               | Special            |
| --------- | ---: | -----------: | -------------------: | ------------------ |
| bear      |  12  |            9 | Sight=8,<br>Smell=12 |                    |
| bison     |  12  |            9 | Sight=9              | horns              |
| elephant  |  14  |            8 | Sight=9              | prehensile trunk   |
| fox       |   6  |           12 | Smell=12             |                    |
| goat      |   8  |           10 |                      | horns              |
| kangaroo  |  10  |           10 | Smell=11             | leaping            |
| lion      |  10  |           12 | Smell=12,<br>Hearing=11 | carnivore          |
| monkey    |   8  |           13 |                      | prehensile tail    |
| rabbit    |   5  |           12 | Smell=12,<br>Hearing=11 | may go berserk     |
| raccoon   |   6  |           13 | Sight=11             |                    |
| rhino     |  13  |            8 | Sight=7,<br>Smell=11    |                    |
| tiger     |  10  |           12 | Smell=12,<br>Hearing=11 | carnivore          |
| wolf      |   9  |           11 | Smell=12             |                    |
| zebra     |  10  |           10 | Smell=11             |                    |

## Shaping

A small number of living creatures have the ability to manipulate one of the seven elements.
Those who have this ability have an average score of 10 for it
no matter what their species.

*  **Earth**: dirt and stone, but *not* metal.

*  **Air**: wind.

*  **Fire**: flames.

*  **Water**: including ice.

*  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.

*  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.  (Nobody can stop or reverse time, or see the future.)

*  **Dream**: dreams and feelings.

It is extremely rare for someone to be able to shape more than one element,
and no one can shape opposite elements:
Earth and Air,
Fire and Water,
Luck and Time.
(As far as anyone knows,
Dream doesn't have an opposite.)

## Bots

The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning floors to mining the ocean floor.
Since their disappearance,
those left behind have had to improvise repairs however they could
to keep themselves going.
The result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike.
One might have six short legs and a pair of mis-matched claws for arms,
while another might use two rotor fans to fly,
but have only a single slender manipulator to pick things up.

Bots have Size and Coordination scores just like living characters,
but don't have Health:
they just have Strength instead.
Their Sight and Hearing scores are 10 by default,
but only a few bots have any sense of smell or taste.
(Most regard smell as slightly icky,
and would prefer that living creatures didn't talk about it so much.)

## Skills

Every character has certain skills,
which are things they're particularly good at.
The drudge may allow players to add other skills to their characters.

### Example: Madica

Madica is a teenage fox girl.
She's a bit on the small side,
even for her species,
but she has worked on her parents' fishing boat every day since she was a child,
so she is quite healthy.
She is also very good with her hands
(she's had a lot of practice tying knots and mending nets)
and has a keen nose.
She recently discovered that she can shape water a little bit,
and desperately wants to find someone to teach her how to do more.

| Trait         | Score |
| ------------- | ----: |
| Size          |     5 |
| Health        |    12 |
| Coordination  |    13 |
| Strength      |     6 |
| Smell         |    12 |
| Water shaping |     8 |

### Example: Rhymes With Orange

Rhymes With Orange was designed to clean windows on ultra-tall skyscrapers.
It has long spidery limbs with suction cups for climbing,
but a very small body,
and has modified the water jets on its arms to squirt almost any kind of liquid.

| Trait        | Score |
| ------------ | ----: |
| Height       |    12 |
| Weight       |     7 |
| Coordination |    10 |
| Strength     |    11 |

- Can shoot liquid 5m using either hand (skill: 13)
- Can climb smooth surfaces like glass using suction cups (skill: 16)
- Can climb pretty much anything else, too (skill: 14)
- Has storage tank built into back for liquids (10 liters)

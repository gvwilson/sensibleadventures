- bigger reveal for the captain's death and its effect on Piaerre

- Razi's blue vials of darkness need to be revealed earlier

- make sure to mention Jaromir's long sleeveless coat

The climax takes place on the Shoulder (the former peak of the
mountain). Hidden among the trees (and clearly predating them) are
stone benches and tables, statues of impossible creatures, and odder
things, like a three-story Mobius strip carved from a single block of
granite. The Avauntois generally leave it alone, as legend has it that
anyone who vandalizes the statues inevitably meets a horrible end.

* The next morning, many of the Hett are gone (including
  Jaromir). Piaerre asks what's happening; the woman who is now in
  command (the one who he remembers spying) tells him brusquely that
  they were needed elsewhere to clear land. This starts a swirl of
  rumors among the Avauntois: are the Hett planning to build their own
  villages, rather than force the Avauntois out? How will the mountain
  sustain them? (The last only works if I've already had people
  discuss the fact that the mountain is slowly running out of
  topsoil---I need this to foreshadow key elements of the sequel.)

* Jack the Parrot discovers that the Hett are pulling down trees on
  the Shoulder. He has overheard them talking: whatever they're
  planning, they're going to do that night. Gaeston resolves to do
  something, with or without anyone's help. Laeuc objects that he
  should ask the bosun; Gaeston replies, "Sure I'll ask him. I'll ask
  him if he wants to come along or not." How to get their gear?
  They'll take their stuff to Papaere Vurt for repair; he'll meet them
  on the trail to hand it over, near the tunnel where he stashes his
  contraband.

* They sneak out of town and meet Vurt. Thomas arrives (having been
  watching from the clouds since dropping Iseulle off---anxious
  questions from Piaerre are rebuffed by Gaeston, who says it's no
  time for mooning after a girl). Despite Thomas's precautions, the
  Hett have seen the boat come in. They attack: the bosun is killed,
  the traps Papaere Vurt has set around the tunnel mouth kill a couple
  of Hett, the Avauntois escape into the night aboard Thomas's flying
  boat.

* Thomas uses the fireflies to find Razi. Piaerre's quick action saves
  the bookster (as at present). Furious, Thomas drops them on the
  mountain and flies away in a huff.

* Razi works a small spell to mislead the Hett: puts a bit of flesh
  from each of the Avauntois into a bag, ties it to Jack's leg, tells
  him not to fly too fast. Razi then leads them into the tunnels,
  using a magic key stolen during his escape from the Hett. "La, they
  know how much you hate being underground," he explains.

* Razi's quicksilver sword acts as a compass to guide them to the
  casket while it is still in transit. There are too many Hett to
  attack, but Gaeston does anyway. Donaien and Armaend join
  in. Piaerre sees Armaend strike at the Hett magician holding the
  casket. flames shoot out from Armaend's grip on his spear; he drops
  it, and is killed. Razi throws another vial of darkness, and
  Donaien's suicidal charge is obscured.

* Piaerre uses a boat hook as a club with his unfeeling hand to strike
  the magician down. In some ways, this is the climax of the story:
  it's the first violence Piaerre has committed, and marks the point
  at which he stops reading and thinking, and starts doing.

* Piaerre doesn't get very far with the casket: he is trapped by
  moving walls and revived bonescuttles. (Turns out they are servants
  of the mountain: the one that Vurt killed years ago woke
  accidentally.)

* The remaining quarter (Piaerre, Razi, Laeuc, and Gaeston) are taken
  to the field on the mountain's shoulder. Strange machinery, eldritch
  magic, etc. Razi is thrown off the mountain; the Angel is
  reawakened; Laeuc, Gaeston, and Piaerre are teleported back to
  Starboard Town, and moments later, the mountain begins to turn over.

* Piaerre's growth: he's afraid of fighting Fraederiq, then he doesn't
  want to, then he accepts that he might have to, or something like
  that (parallel the growth of Mae in Air).

* Must introduce the Stone Menagerie on the Shoulder (at least twice)
  before the climax.

* Discuss the fact that the Hett are slowly running out of topsoil.

* Thomas must knock on the door of every room he enters.

* Explain naming days: the person is given back their name on the
  anniversary of their birth each year; the ceremony takes place next
  ot the tree planted when they're born.

* Use the farewell, "Shalma'a," several more times in the story.

* Dogs are extinct in modern times (after a magical plague two
  centuries ago). This is why people say things like, "You look like
  you've seen a dog!" Not relevant to this story, so take it out:
  replace with things like, "You look like you were just kissed by a
  ghost!"

* At the same time, add more (dumb) beasts: pre-modern towns and
  villages were full of domestic animals.

* Mention the door soldiers (carvings that stand guard beside shop
  doors in Forecastle and elsewhere).

* When they first see Tinhead, there's a pyramid in the center of each
  square. Klaues is the one who says, "They could be otthonkos." Word
  spreads, and some of the Hett in Forecastle are attacked. (Reveals
  that Klaues does know about his own people's legends.)

* "Miraculously, people did." Seems awfully convenient.

* What happens to the Bantangui fan book? Is it dropped in a crate, or
  re-folded and set aside?

* Cut the description of Bantangui calligraphy: not relevant, impedes
  flow.

* "Whether the captain's wife had detected anything strange in
  Starboard Town." Clumsy foreshadowing.

* Every one of the books mentioned the mountain, but only a few said
  anything more than, "It's big, it flies back and forth, and its
  people have no sense of humor." "Do people really think that about
  us?" Piaerre asked the fourth time he read it. "Oh, la," Razi said
  diplomatically, "They don't know you as well as I do."

* The main square in the Forecastle is called Mapmarket Square. The
  tiles are laid out as a map of Avaunt's progress over Cherne; the
  mountain's path is picked out in coins. Every evening, the chief
  bosun moves a peg showing the mountain's progress.

* Have Vurt grumble that the skull of the first bonescuttle he killed
  was bigger.

* Has Piaerre ever seen a forest fire burning from on high?

* Titles and honorifics: the Avauntois use sieur and daeme for men and
  women. Uw and daw (uncle and aunt) are affectionate honorifics (like
  "boss") borrowed from Bantangui.

* A banner of snow blown off Avaunt's peak.

* Cutting and drying moss for use in the stinky house.

* Laeuc: "Oh, the Karabandi don't sacrifice chickens. They just scold
  them severely."

* A painting showing a boxer throwing the same punch forever.

* Razi: "We back into the future (must do, because we can see the past
  as we go)."

* A lammergeier is a bearded vulture that eats bones.

* A "saint" is a great scholar, inventor, or engineer. Saint
  Bearnard's Bridge, Saint Ehrm's balm, etc.

* They should swear by the death of all dogs, and by all the clocks
  that ever ticked.

* Quecenne talking about Vurt and Mayeule: old people get cute as they
  shrivel up.

* Spitting seeds over the balcony, watching the cat run up to each one
  in turn to sniff it.

* Vurt: "He's as dumb as a tiger." Piaerre: "But tigers aren't---oh."

* Steps of the Hardeck worn smooth by a waterfall of feet.

* Piaerre feels guilty about outgrowing his parents (particularly his
  father) intellectually, but doesn't want to stop it happening.

* "Malefit" is the opposite of "benefit".

* Avaunt needs more geography: ought to be at least one stone bridge
  across a ravine, and places where pulleys have been anchored to the
  rock to help Starboard Towners move loads from the Hardeck.

* A pattern on silk called "peacock's tears".

* The problem with books is that they can't change their minds.

* The hurt you get in the back of your throat when you're trying to
  stop yourself from crying.

* Feeding dyed grain to chickens to make them lay colored eggs (a
  story Laeuc told Piaerre when his son was young; Piaerre still has
  the egg).

* "That's like asking which side of a coin is the 'real' one." (Razi
  talking about who's right and who's wrong.)

* Some houses in the Forecastle have a "door soldier" (a large doll)
  by the front door: Enswer tradition.

* Jack the Parrot threatening to cake on someone's head. (Use "cake"
  more frequently, and have Piaerre get in trouble for using it.)

* "He could already feel Fraederiq's hands around his throat..." Feels
  "unearned": need to foreshadow Fraederiq as a bully before this.

* "Two thoughts chased each other..." Get inside Piaerre's head a
  little more here: have him remember some of Fraederiq's past mocking
  and bullying, so that readers can understand his indecision.

* "He could only guess how many hours Vaszlav had spent badgering..."
  Important character development point, but feels rushed.

* "A narrow bed and a polished teak dresser..." Move this detail up,
  so that it's better integrated.

* "...wondering in its little mind" Shift the POV.

* "Vurt was on his verandah, cursing in a flat monotone..." Seems to
  shift the POV to Vurt (needs to be Piaerre). Subsequent conversation
  slows the pace down.

* "weeping compass" only works if we already know that "weeping" is a
  curse.

* "A moment later, Vurt heard..." Another POV shift.

* "Piaerre stared at the map. The Brumosos curved..." Get inside
  Piaerre's head here: does he think that Fraederiq will never see
  this again? Or is that too maudlin?

* Mention somewhere that the mountain affects the weather around it
  (but less than the Avauntois think).

* "It didn't seem right, practicing verbs...but he couldn't think of
  anything else to do." Again, too passive: makes Piaerre an
  anti-hero.

* "Today you will finish with those deeds, yes?" Use "ledgers", and
  make it clear that these are things Piaerre was assigned earlier.

* "La, but enough of books for one evening." Have Piaerre be
  frustrated by Razi closing the topic, to express the reader's
  frustration at being teased.

* "...only for gallops for Jack the parrot..." Sounds strange, since
  parrots don't gallop.

* "By my eyes, a dozen rabbits..." Need a better segue into this, so
  that it's clear the omniscient/reflective bit is over.

* "People falling from a great height..." Too obvious.

* "I do," Piaerre blurted. Piaerre is betraying Razi in a small way by
  spilling the beans here. It needs to be more dramatic: is Piaerre
  doing it because solidarity with his fellow Avauntois takes
  precedence over his relationship with his teacher? The scene shift
  at the end (Thomas's arrival) gets Piaerre and the reader out of
  dealing with the consequences---maybe better to stick with them a
  little longer?

* Papere Vurt snorted. "Looks a lot safer than what I rode up on." He
  needs to make a comment that makes it clear he understands the game
  Thomas is playing, but is willing to go along for his grandson's
  sake (or because he doesn't quite trust Razi?).

* "Razi and Thomas were already on board." They're very flat here:
  need the scene to crackle with tension between them to make it clear
  that while they are very reluctant allies, they will put their
  differences aside and actually work together.

* "The tunnels!" Piaerre exclaimed, pointing at the image in the
  window. This is too early: he already figures out the tunnels in a
  later scene.

* "Was it---who dropped it off?" Piaerre needs to be a little more
  shocked by the (presumed) theft at this point. Later, he briefly
  entertains the notion of keeping it (since he didn't steal it
  himself), but even as he thinks it, he knows he's just playing with
  the idea.

* "First, lie my Razi on his back." Why can she see him now, when she
  couldn't see him when Piaerre spoke to her the first time?

* "...and grabbed the window ledge." He needs to be clumsy here: he's
  still adjusting to his numb hand. Need to comment on it a few more
  times later, and then have him do something when he gets back to
  Starboard Town without even realizing (at first) that he's
  compensating for the numbness.

* "But what about the rest of our things?" Piaerre's first question
  ought to be about Starboard Town and his family.

* "It took them half an hour..." Piaerre should be noticing how clumsy
  his hand is during this half hour.

* "A piece of cake?" Doesn't work if "cake" is an obscenity.

* "...he couldn't even hate himself properly for having frozen again."
  Scene is too sparse to have any real emotional impact. It should
  have more adrenalin; he should blame his numb hand (and immediately
  hate himself for the lie). This is also where we first find out that
  he thinks at some level that helping Razi ought to have squared what
  happened with Fraederiq.

* "The bookster spread his his hands. 'La, nothing that hasn't
  already, I think.'" Razi is nonchalant about the Hett invasion, but
  Piaerre wouldn't be. Would Iseulle?

* Vurt's ladder: needs to have been reassembled and used (by the
  fleeing families) before Piaerre et al return to Starboard Town.

* "Idjen cakhuisa." The bosun, Jaromir, and Piaerre are together, just
  as they were at the beginning of the story: should use this echo
  somehow.

* "I'll be a haunt before you'll be his anything." Make it clear here
  that what Elaiene's upset about is the impropriety: appearances
  instinctively take precedence in her mind over anything else.

* "How many bushels of squash did we grow each year?" Piaerre has to
  say that he lied (though he doesn't know how much good it will do,
  given how much they obviously already know). Can't afford for him to
  be seen as a collaborator.

* When Gaeston calls Piaerre a leech, Piaerre has to feel the
  injustice of it---remember, he lied to the Hett.

* Piaerre's conversation with Jaromir about the library (which Jaromir
  calls the birbetke): the story has suddenly stepped back from
  Piaerre's thoughts. Need to keep it close: need to know what Piaerre
  is feeling as Jaromir tries to be friendly.

* "They got Iseulle to bed eventually." Even in shock, she wouldn't be
  this passive.

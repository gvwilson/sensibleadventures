# Shudarga

## Overall

- Because "The Cloudherd and the Tiger's Boy" is stalled, and after the US election, I need to write something sharper
- Theme: awakening to privilege and unfairness
- Length: 30,000 words (so one major episode, one plot line, small number of characters)
  - Aim for 15 chapters of 2000 words each (approx)

## Characters

- Shudarga (Panday Sapphire Shudarga): the hero
  - 15-year-old girl
  - Only daughter of minor aristocratic family
  - Doing her orphanage with Maker Kelsang
    - Spend a couple of years pretending to be an orphan and learning a trade
    - Custom among the aristocacy: acquaint their children with commoners' lives
    - But a bit of a sham
      - Some families make a living fostering a mix of rich kids and real orphans (but only the nice ones)
  - Over the course of the story, Shudarga comes to see how unfair her society is
    - Laws are owned by noble families, who rent them out to people who want to win lawsuits
    - Laws are often auctioned off, so whoever can pay the most will win the lawsuit
      - Either rent the law directly, or prevent opponent from renting it
  - Having this kind of power over the law has made these families wealthy
    - Metaphor for our world, where being able to hire expensive lawyers ensures victory
  - Shudarga wants to help Damcho because:
    - She wants Damcho to be her friend
      - Damcho tells her (gently but firmly) that friendship can't be bought
    - She becomes ashamed of the injustice
  - Key moment when Damcho asked Shudarga, "Why are you doing this for me?  Why aren't you doing this for Kelsang?"

- Panday Malachite Damcho: Shudarga's housemate
  - Turns 16 during the course of the story
  - A real orphan
  - She is also apprenticed to Kelsang
  - Grown beyond her years
    - Her foster home before Namdol's was unpleasant
  - Shudarga envies Damcho's self-assurance
    - Scene in which Damcho stares down apprentices bullying Panday in the market
    - Only realize afterward how scared Damcho was
    - And that Damcho's self-assurance came at a price
  - Represents those who keep their dignity in defeat

- Panday Sapphire Choenyi: also Shudarga's housemate
  - 14-year-old boy
  - Like everyone else, he has figured out that Shudarga is nobility
  - Sucks up
    - Part of why Shudarga likes Damcho is that Damcho *isn't* Choenyi
  - Plants stolen property in Kelsang's shop to give Jangchup an excuse to take Kelsang to court
    - "Because I'm a *real* orphan, and if I don't look out for myself, no one else will!"
  - Represents those who defect because they're weak and afraid

- Maker Kelsang: fosters Damcho and Shudarga
  - Started life as Panday Topaz Kelsang (a real fosterling herself)
  - A quiet, gentle man, more at home with wood than people

- Host Namdol: runs a foster home
  - Knows perfectly well that Shudarga is nobility
    - Nod and a wink
  - Flatters her noble visitors, spoils Shudarga, is cruel to Choenyi and Damcho
    - Embarrasses Shudarga
  - Represents those who get along
    - Doesn't see why Kelsang is making such a fuss when Jangchup's offer is perfectly reasonable
    - Shudarga: "What would you do if it was this house?"
    - Namdol (blankly): "Why on earth would he want this house?  It's nowhere near his works."
    - Shudarga: "But what if?"
    - Namdol (dismissively): "Oh, stop talking such nonsense."

- Respected Jangchup: the villain
  - Middle-aged and ambitious
    - Cartoon-greedy (make him a proper villain)
    - "Children?  Where's the profit in that?"
  - Has acquired several family businesses in the past few years
    - Starts with an offer to purchase, but won't take 'no' for an answer
    - Kelsang has known this was coming, but was fatalistic
    - "What hope do I have? Men like me can't afford laws."
  - A new word: "manufactury"
    - Jangchup used his family's ownership of the law governing waterwheels
      to prevent other sawmills from replacing theirs as they broke
    - Now each of those mills makes just one thing

- Judge Rigsang: the judge
  - Plump, perspiring, and peevish (again, cartoonish)
  - Doesn't like Jangchup (changing too many things) but values class solidarity
    - Was pleased when Shudarga's parents wouldn't rent one of their laws to Jangchup
      so that he could force a flower farmer to widen a road
    - (Mention this in passing - not a major point)

- Apprentice Lhodak: works in Jangchup's manufactury.
  - Leads a small gang of bullies (other apprentices from the manufactury)
  - As the manufactury drives other woodworkers out of business,
    the apprentices who work their have started swaggering around those who work elsewhere
  - Really doesn't like it when Damcho points out that they might one day be Makers,
    but won't ever have their own mills
    - Damcho: "You'll never have what Maker Kelsang has: freedom"
    - Lhodak (sneering): "Freedom to what?  Starve?  Beg in the streets?"
  - Represents those who collude

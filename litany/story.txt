# And Should I Fall Behind
# Greg Wilson

*"They're coming," the younger warned,
eyes closed in concentration as he stretched his eldritch senses to their limits.*

*"Oh really?" the older snapped.
He shifted his alien black sword to his left hand and drew his blaster with his right.
It only had a dozen charges left,
and who knew how effective it would be against the half-dimensional horrors pursuing them,
but its weight was comforting.*

*Not for the first time,
he wished his brother was just a little less smart.
Just a little.
Just less-smart enough to not be able to piece together
the strangely-cold shards of a map made when the sun was still yellow
and–*

"Spoiler."
Robbie struggled to sit up.
"That's a spoiler.
We don't know how old the map is yet, do we?"

"Um…"
George flipped back a couple of pages and nodded.
"Okay, good catch.
That'll be easy to fix–it's just a bit of pencil work.
You want to keep going?"
He carefully didn't glance at his brother as he asked.

Robbie settled back on the bed that had been his home for the last two months.
He claimed he didn't notice the drip tube stuck in his arm any more,
but whenever George came to visit,
it always seemed to catch the corner of his eye.
It,
and the quiet machine it was connected to,
and the faint under-smell of sweat and antiseptic
that reminded him of their mother's final illness in the same room
fifteen years before.

"'Sokay if we take a break?"
Robbie yawned.
He gestured at the laptop waiting on the bed tray in his lap.
"I want to take another run at the congestion algorithms."

"Sure.
I'm supposed to get home soon anyway,"
his brother lied.
He slipped the loose pages he'd drawn that morning back into his folder and stood up.
"You need anything?"

Robbie shook his head,
already opening the laptop.
"I'm good.
Say hi to Boots for me."

"'Course.
She'll come by on the weekend."
George hesitated,
just as he always did when the time came to leave.
They had never been a hugging family,
but the one time he and Robbie had bumped fists,
they had both burst out laughing at how ridiculous it felt.
As far as George could remember,
that was the last time either of them had laughed.
"You sure you'll be okay?"

Robbie looked up from the dense tangle of simulation statistics on his screen.
"You mean, am I going to have another episode?
No idea.
But I'm recording my screen and the router is dumping all my traffic off site,
so if I do,
maybe it'll help the doctor figure out what's happening.
You know,
when I'm not actually me."
And then he smiled their mother's smile,
the smile that meant,
"I love you but I'd like to get back to work now."

George closed the door gently behind him,
went downstairs,
and slumped into an overstuffed blue chair that had been
one of Robbie's few additions to the decor.
He closed his eyes and waited for the tears to come.
When they finished,
he wiped his eyes on his sleeve and got shakily to his feet.
Six pages a day was a punishing pace,
but this was one deadline he wasn't going to miss.

The quiet clatter of dishes in the kitchen made him change direction
from the front door to the back.
He knocked gently on the door frame.
"Hey."

The nurse looked up.
A slim middle-aged woman with an Asian face and a Boston accent,
she had come in every day since Robbie started losing hours.
A pot of tea sat steeping on the table next to a tray of overcooked pasta and oxycodone.
She would sit with him to make sure he ate it all,
then take care of what the agency euphemistically called "close personal care".
George had spoken to her so many times now that he was too embarrassed to ask her name.

"Good morning," she said,
setting her book aside.
It was one of his mother's,
he noticed,
erudite and speculative and about as approachable as the progressive rock his brother used to listen to.
"How are you doing?"

George shrugged.
"'M all right.
He's working.
Seems to be himself."

The nurse nodded and stood.
"Good.
He said they've moved the launch date back again.
It's…"
She hesitated,
trying to find words.

George's jaw tightened.
"It's well after he'll be gone.
I know."

He rode the streetcar home,
east from the university annex where he and Robbie had grown up
to a neighborhood of gentrified two-story homes
with big front windows and small back yards
where children played street hockey while parents compared notes on renovations and schools.
Two slices of Saran-wrapped pizza and a note saying "Eat this or else! - Boots"
were waiting for him on a stool in front of the coat closet.
He took them and his folder upstairs to the spare bedroom that doubled as his studio,
taped down a fresh page,
and picked up his pencil.

*They called it a palace,
but the Sareeav hadn't been anything like human,
and no one knew what purpose their enormous serpentine structures had served,
or how they had survived for aeons under the ice.
That was the real reason they had come:
not the alien treasures that would buy them an army to avenge their parents and reclaim the throne,
but the chance to reclaim some long-forgotten knowledge
and fill a void in the world's memory of itself.
The craving to understand had drawn the younger brother into one perilous misadventure after another.
For all that he complained,
the older couldn't imagine any other life.*

*Not that it looked like he had much life left to imagine.
An adult flying polyp could devour the minds of an entire city in a single night–even
the Mi-go feared them,
and the Mi-go feared nothing.
There was little comfort in knowing that the freshly-hatched larvae pursuing them
would take weeks or months to suck their souls dry.
"You just had to see what was behind that bloody door, didn't you?"
the older brother panted.*

*The younger brother smiled a smile that meant,
"I'll make this up to you later but right now we have work to do."
The chip of jade set in his forehead was glowing,
and faint shadows cast by nothing mere eyes could see
danced on either side of him.*

"George?"
He straightened at the sound of his voice and rolled his head to work the kinks out of his neck.

"Upstairs,"
he called.
Suddenly aware of the hours that had passed,
he pulled open his desk drawer,
swept the uneaten pizza into it,
and closed it again just as the door opened behind him.

His wife crossed the room and kissed the bald spot on the top of his head.
"How's he doing?"

"He's dying," George replied.
Then he sighed and wrapped his arms around her.
"Sorry, love.
You knew that."

"I know."
She pulled him up out of his chair to hug him.
"Was he all there this time?"

George nodded.
"Seemed to be.
We went through the pages I did yesterday."
His shaky laugh was muffled by his wife's hair.
"Kinda nice that he's taking an interest.
I just wish…"
This time he didn't fight the tears when they came.

The next morning was chilly-damp rather than bone-freezing cold.
The city had only seen one real snowstorm that winter,
and as much as he enjoyed his face not hurting when he went outside,
George missed the season.
The only painting he had kept from his twenties was of the elm in his mother's backyard,
bare branches blanketed with white.
The tree was gone now too,
cut down after the arborist told them it couldn't be saved.
Someone had told him there were fewer than a hundred left in the whole city.
He had thought about tracking them down and sketching them,
but graphic novels paid better,
even the ones that weren't tied to video games.

The nurse met him at the door.
"He's not himself right now," she said without preamble,.
"You might want to give him some time before going up there."

George hung his coat and took the deck of cards from its pocket.
"I'd give him all the time in the world if I could.
Excuse me."

She maneuvered to put herself between him and the stairs.
"I don't think–"
She cut herself off as he slipped past her to take the steps two at a time.

Robbie didn't look up when George knocked on the door frame.
"Hello."

"Hi,"
George said as casually as he could.
It wasn't unusual for his brother to lose himself in his work,
but "hello"?
When had he ever said "hello"?

The silence stretched.
"Still trying to fix the congestion whatsit?"
George asked.

Robbie shook his head,
his eyes fixed on his laptop's screen.
"That proved to be an interesting challenge.
I sent the solution to the team last night.
I expect it will take them some time to understand,
so I am using the time to do some research."

"Ah."
George drew the deck of cards from his pocket and riffled them.
"Would you be up for some poker instead?"

At that, Robbie finally looked up.
"Poker.
Yes, thank you, I would enjoy that."
He set his laptop on the table beside his bed.
"The usual stakes?"

George hesitated.
"I don't think you're going to be washing the dishes any time soon."

Robbie's smile looked exactly like it always had,
except for not touching his eyes.
"But you can."

They played a dozen hands.
Robbie folded five times and won the other seven.
"I'm going to quit while I'm behind,"
George said after his brother laid down another pair of queens.

Robbie nodded.
"Thank you for the game."

"Sure."
George looked at the rail-thin figure lying in the bed,
certain now that whoever he was talking to,
it wasn't the brother he had grown up with.
"'Sokay if I check in later?"

"Of course,"
Robbie said,
already reaching for his laptop.
"It's always a pleasure to see you."

The nurse was waiting at the bottom of the stairs.
"I'm sorry," she said quietly.

George thrust his hands into his pockets and studied her coldly.
"Thanks.
Have you ever seen-I mean,
have any of your other patients ever…?"

The nurse shook her head,
fingering the green-gray stone hanging on a simple silver chain around her neck.
She dropped her hand when she noticed him looking at it.
"I've only ever read about it.
I'm sure it'll pass."

"Thanks,"
George said again,
dragging his eyes away from her necklace.
His mother had kept a stone carved with the same odd five-pointed shape on her desk,
and he'd seen the pattern in some of her books as well.
He had started to doodle it once at the dinner table,
but she had stopped him.
"I'm going to run a few errands–I'll be back around dinner time."

He shrugged his arms into his coat on his way out the door,
pulled his phone from the inside pocket,
and opened his contact list.
It had been fifteen years,
and the man George needed to speak to had been old even then,
but he still answered on the second ring.
"That coffee shop still there?"
he asked half way through George's third sentence.

"Yeah, but–"

"Half an hour."
He hung up without waiting for George to answer.

Doctor Biczo had leathered with age.
What little hair he'd had when George first met him was gone–even his eyebrows
had finally given up.
But his eyes were still a piercing blue,
and his grip was as strong as an eagle's when he shook George's hand.
"Sorry about Robbie,"
he said without preamble,
seating himself across from George
and setting the cup of dime store coffee he'd brought with him on the rickety table.

"Thanks."
George sipped his own over-priced mug of mostly foam,
suddenly unsure where to start.
"He's doing okay, I guess.
The cancer's…"
He shrugged.
"He didn't want to do chemo,
not after what Mom went through,
so we're just trying to keep him comfortable and stop him from losing weight too fast and…"
He shrugged again.

Doctor Biczo waited patiently for him to go on,
just as he had when he interviewed George and Robbie during their mother's illness
on behalf of whatever unspecified government agency he doctored for.
"He's not himself sometimes."
George cupped his hands around his mug to warm them.
"Like Mom was,
so I was wondering if you ever found out–I mean,
is this some kind of genetic thing?"

The old man shook his head.
"I don't think so.
At least, nobody ever told me it was.
How often does it happen?"

"Almost every day,"
George confessed reluctantly.
Another patient silence stretched and broke.
"I know you must be retired by now,
but I was wondering if you could come by and,
I dunno,
talk to him and…"
He shrugged again,
unsure what he was really asking for
beyond a grownup to tell him that everything was going to be all right.

Doctor Biczo snorted.
"You're in luck.
Turns out retired isn't really a thing these days.
Sure,
let's go talk to him."
He drained his coffee in one long swallow and stood.

"Uh, now?"
George hastily gulped a too-hot mouthful of his own coffee and stood as well,
wishing as he'd known he would that he hadn't started whatever he had apparently just started.

The doctor's ten-year-old BMW smelled faintly of cigarettes and leather,
even though the seats were covered in cordura
and George was pretty sure Biczo didn't smoke.
They drove four blocks in silence and parked on the street two houses down from Robbie's,
even though the drive was empty.
George waited while the doctor tested the car's doors to make sure they were really locked,
wondering why someone who cared so much about his ride wouldn't have fixed the scratches on the trunk,
then followed him into the house.

The nurse came down the stairs to meet them as they came through the door.
"I wasn't expecting you back so soon,"
she said,
obviously flustered.

George jerked his head at Doctor Biczo.
"Just wanted to get a second opinion on Robbie.
Is he awake?"

"Yes, but I don't think he–"
The nurse stopped abruptly
as Doctor Biczo finished hanging his coat and turned around.
She moved aside to clear the stairs,
her eyes downcast.
"I'm sure he'll be happy to see you."

George had a moment of *deja vu* as he trudged up the stairs with Doctor Biczo behind him.
The two of them had climbed the same stairs together fifteen years ago
each time the old man came to examine George's mother.
"He's a specialist," the oncologist had explained uncomfortably the first time.
*I thought you were the specialist,*
George had thought,
but he had kept the thought to himself.
Not Robbie–he had demanded an explanation when they were shut out of their mother's room
during Doctor Biczo's visits,
and then slammed his bedroom door and thrown himself into yet another programming project
when none was forthcoming.

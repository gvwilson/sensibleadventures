        There it is in your gut: that *feeling* again.

        The older brother (who would always think of himself that way)
        shouldered his pack.
        He looked up at the orange sun,

        Once upon a time a little girl was born.
        This is the story of the numbers that were born with her–where they came from,
        how they moved from place to place,
        who used them and fixed them and how they met other numbers
        until finally, one day, they were called home.

        In the beginning there was a great Big Bang, so powerful that
        the whole universe is still expanding.  This is the story of
        what happened afterward, of the Earth and life and civilization
        and maybe, just maybe, of what comes next.

        Take a mountain, lift it into the air, and set it adrift: that
        is Avaunt.  But look closer—there, in a village on its starboard
        flank. A girl is running for her life. She just felt the
        mountain shake for the first time in centuries, but that's not
        what she's afraid of. She's afraid of what the boy chasing her
        will do if he catches her...

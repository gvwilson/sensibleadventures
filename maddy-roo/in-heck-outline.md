## To Do

- Fix first story so that the thing in the swamp comes together out of snake-like parts

## Characters

- Madica (Maddy) Roo: a 13-year-old kangaroo (protagonist)
- Sindy Roo: Madica's 10-year-old sister, and a luck shaper
  - Being trained in secret by Shaper Leaf
- Mama Roo: their mother
  - The postmistress, schoolteacher, and portrait painter of Rusty Bridge
- Papa Roo: their father
  - Was a mechanic despite prejudice that only raccoons and monkeys could be good ones
  - Taken four years ago during a thiever raid
- Gumption Gruff: a 12-year-old goat
  - Madica's best friend
  - Loves books, which makes him odd for a goat
- Shaper Leaf: a 200-year-old tortoise and an earth shaper
  - Now coaching Sindy Roo as she explores her talent
- Mayor Lupus
  - A wolf (as Mama Roo says, "A *very* alpha female.")
- Dockety (fully, "Dockety-One Forty-Bee"): a newly-woken bot
- Crusher: Dockety's hauler friend
- Shaper Blazes: a tiger and fire shaper
  - Leads a group of Prosecutors to Rusty Bridge after the first attack
  - Scornful of Shaper Leaf's decision to lead a quiet life
- Mouse: a small maintenance bot from Patient's lair
  - Turns out to be part of the Gears
- The Gears
  - A swarm bot that claims to live in the cracks and crevices of Heck
  - Turns out to be part of Central
- Central: the computer that runs Heck
  - Doing maintenance until the Makers return
- ARM 47: an Autonomous Robotic Manipulator
  - Central's minions and prison guards
- ARM 15: smaller Central-controlled bot

## Ideas

- Bluster and Bravo caught trying to steal weapons from the bots who are now living in Rusty Bridge
  - Prosecutors come down hard on the bots rather than the thieves
  - Shaper Leaf observes that the Prosecutors don't seem to mind that the breathers have weapons
  - Shaper Blazes doesn't like being challenged
- Dockety is the unofficial leader of the bots
  - "Patient will return. We will defend ourselves. And you."
- Explains that it saw Papa Roo working some ancient machines
  - "Some will only work for the living, and not even for all of them"
  - Find out later that there are genetic markers that only a few breathers have
- Story ends with a message from deep space that the Makers are returning and with Lasercase rising from the Mire
- Rusty Bridge "breathers" fear their new bot neighbors
  - Set up near the charging pillar a few minutes outside of town
  - Helping with farmwork and fixing the road
  - Zeke the bear grumbles the most, and doesn't take kindly to jokes that it's because he's no longer the strongest
- a whiff of BLM
  - the Prosecutors are supposed to be impartial
  - clearly biased toward breathers, even though some of them are bots themselves
- rescue Papa Roo
  - "It's hopeless"
  - "Maybe not with a luck shaper"
  - "You are not going to risk your life!"
  - "You can't stop me."
- keeping Sindy's powers secret so she isn't "recruited" by the Prosecutors
  - "You wouldn't be sleepin' rough like us. You'd be in the Governor's mansion makin' sure things went right."
  - "What if I don't want to be?"
  - Blazes' ears went back. "You didn't earn this gift, so it ain't rightly yours."
- romance between Maddy and Gumption
  - inter-species romances are common among teens, but most folk settle down with their own kind
  - Gumption's mother is a goat, but his father is a sheep
  - Gets teased (bullied) for having mixed parentage
  - "Doctors and donors and it's kind of personal so how about we don't talk about it?"
  - Except Mama Roo brings it up as gently as she can with Maddy, who really (really) doesn't want to talk about it
- Central and Shaper Blazes are mirror images of each other
  - both believe the ends justify the means
- the Prosecutors include a bot and a cyborg
  - not just about protecting people from bots
  - "There are plenty of bad breathers out there as well" says the bot (gets smacked for using the word)
- Shaper Blazes sneers that other tortoises have served as Prosecutors
  - turns out Shaper Leaf used to be a Prosecutor but left because he lost faith in what they were doing
- Shaper Leaf sacrifices himself in the end to destroy Central
  - tells Sindy it's good luck not bad: "always wanted... to be useful..."
- the Makers' enormous ship enters orbit at the end
- which is a signal for Lasercase to emerge from the Mire
  - it has become a vessel for the Gears, which turns out to be the real villain
- The Gears needs Sindy's luck shaping to defeat Central

  - Maddy: "I don't believe it"

  - "I gotta tell---"
    - "No!" (agitated) "The striped one is not a friend. She will stop you. She will do bad things."

    - Gumption: "I know you will, and---and I hope you know that whatever it is, I'll---you know, whatever."
  - Sindy overhears them (has followed them): "What are you talking about?"
    - Maddy: "None of your business! What are you doing here anyway? Don't you have a lesson?"

    - Conversation ends with Sindy in tears

    - Dockety: "I will bring it."
  - After Shaper Blazes leaves, the bots commune
    - Dockety: "We have to help. If we do not and she fails, we will be blamed."

    - Pfft! Lights flash and go dark as he sets off the EMP that Dockety gave him
    - Looks at the motionless bot: "Something seems too good to be true, it usually is."
  - Patient in Darkness crushes the mouse bot
    - Gumption stumbles back: "Why aren't you dead?"
    - Patient (mad giggle): "This shielded itself long ago. Yes, long ago."
    - Yanks the stool out of Gumption's hands, raises it menacingly, then breaks off its own regulator
    - "If you want to free them now you can, but what about your friends?"
  - Patient rolls away
  - Gumption hesitates, looking at the motionless specimens, then curses and runs off to find Maddy and Sindy

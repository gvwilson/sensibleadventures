People believe a lot of different things about what happens to you when you die.
The farmers of the Ninety Kingdoms bury their dead to thank the earth for its bounty.
Just as flesh becomes soil,
then barley,
then flesh again,
so too,
they believe,
does the world fashion new spirits out of old.

The pirates of Ini Bantang and Barra Bantang believe in rebirth too,
except they believe we are reborn as ourselves to live our lives over again.
This is why they say *im awa pha ta* whenever anything bad happens.
It means, "Oh no, not this again."
And I met a tiger once,
from Thind,
who told me that when we die we're dead
and all the rest is just monkey foolishness.
But later he asked me to ring a bell in memory of a friend of his,
so perhaps tigers can be foolish too.

But in the Karaband,
where I was born,
people believe that when we die we get to tell the story of our life one last time.
It doesn't matter if it's a quiet story or filled with great deeds and poetry.
All that matters is whether the person telling the story enjoys hearing it again.

We Karabandi think it's important to practice our stories,
so every once in a while we go to someone and say,
"This is the tale of me."
Sometimes we seek out a particular listener---a loved one we have wronged
or someone who remembers the sour-sweet taste of the first dates from a long-ago harvest.
Other times it is best if the listener is a stranger on the road or a patient ghost.

And sometimes,
when the story they need to tell is particularly difficult,
people seek out someone who is so good at listening that they have become famous for it.
You can find us in most towns or caravans.
We may have some other profession---cobbler, bookster, even thief---but
what we really do is listen.
We try not to judge,
and we never repeat any of what we're told.
We just help people find out what their lives mean
while they are still living them.

The other thing listeners do is teach people how to tell their stories.
It can be hard if you've never done it before---life sometimes teaches us to hide our feelings,
even from ourselves,
and digging them up can be harder than mining diamonds.
I find the easiest way is to tell people my own story first,
so if there is any tea left...?
And perhaps a little more of the honey?
Thank you.

So *la*,
my name is Eimin,
and this is the tale of me.
I was born in Medef,
on the eastern shore of the Sea of Glass.
The people of Medef are Aphsi,
and they are not like people elsewhere.
They can *drome* whether you are happy or sad,
just as you can smell what is cooking before you go into the kitchen.
Aphsi mothers can tell that babies are hungry or tired before they start to cry.
Aphsi traders always know whether the person they are bargaining with is honest.
And Aphsi thieves are the best in the world.
They can *drome* when a street vendor is sleepy
or whether a guard is paying more attention to the women washing their hair in the courtyard below him
than he is to the sound of tiles being pried loose from the roof over his head.

But not me.
I can't *drome*.
I am *nif*, like you.
I kicked and kicked when I was inside my mother
because I couldn't *drome* her trying to soothe me.
When I was a baby,
I cried when she left the room
because I couldn't *drome* that she were just around the corner.
And when I was older---*la*,
but I will speak of that in its time.

No one knows why the Aphsi are what they are.
Some people think we have always been that way.
Others blame it on the great spells of the Mutiny,
when the Pilot Angels scarred the moon and turned Lake Karaband into the Sea of Glass.
And others,
well,
I will speak of that in its time too.

Let me first tell you what it was like to grow up *nif* among children who could *drome*.
They---the other children my age in Medef---used to play a game with me called "surprise".
Sometimes,
when I was watching an anthill or practicing my letters,
they would sneak up behind me and shout, "Bah!"
I would jump and they would all laugh.
They couldn't imagine what it was like to not know that someone was behind them.
(Did I mention that Aphsi make good guards, as well as good thieves?)

I enjoyed the game sometimes.
It was exciting,
and at least it meant the other children were paying attention to me.
More often, though, it just made me angry.
I would tell them to stop, or run to my mother and ask her to tell them.
They would,
but only long enough for me to go back to my ants or my letters.
Then they would sneak up behind me again, "Bah!"

I still have a scar---here, on the ball of my thumb---from the time
Hediyeh and her friends surprised me while I was carving a new pawn for Razi's chess set.
I was only ten,
and the cut went right down to the bone.
Hediyeh had to go without food for two days as punishment,
and her parents gave my mother a chicken and a spool of fine green thread to apologize,
but as far as Hediyeh and her friends were concerned,
that just made it my fault.

In a way, though, that cut is where my story begins.
That cut, and the talk I had afterward with Razi.
He was *nif* like me.
He showed up in Medef two or three times a year,
lean and dark,
scissors and wire and odd tools in his pack,
a waxed paper bag of sweets in his pocket.
I thought he was a tinker, or maybe a hunter.
A lot of *nif* wind up being hunters or butchers,
since killing anything with more of a soul than a snake makes most Aphsi ill.

Razi came to our house just as my mother put the last stitch into my thumb.
The two of them sat and talked for a while in the shade garden
while I moped around under the awning out back,
picking at my wound and feeling sorry for myself.
When they were done,
Razi came to fetch me for a game of chess.

"Here," he said, "Let me have a look at that."

"It's nothing," I told him sullenly.
"Let's just play."

He shook his head.
"Show me," he insisted.
I shrugged and held out my hand.
He inspected the four black stitches,
then nodded.

"*La*, they used to do that to me too when I was your age."
He took his embroidered chessboard out of its leather sleeve
and unrolled it on the little table outside our front door,
then sat cross-legged on the ground beside it.

I sat on a stool across from him.
"Did you ever cut yourself?"
I asked as I set up my pieces.

"No, but look."
He pulled up his right sleeve.
A beaded old scar ran from his elbow to his wrist
like a thick worm track on his black skin.
"I got so tired of them sneaking up on me that I climbed a date tree to get away from them.
I sat up there for,
*la*,
it must have been hours,
just watching people come and go.
I still remember how peaceful it felt."

He laughed.
"It was so peaceful that I fell asleep!
And *hup*, down I fell.
They had to give me poppy juice and cut my arm open
to straighten out the bones."

"I'd break my arm myself if it would stop Hediyeh and the others from playing stupid tricks on me,"
I grumbled.
I picked up a black pawn,
put my hands behind my back,
and then held my closed fists out to him.

Razi didn't tap one.
Instead, he made a sign in the air against bad luck.
"You should be careful what you ask for," he warned me.
"*La*, and even more careful what you offer in return."

I knew that tone of voice and the look in his eyes.
All of a sudden I was angry,
even angrier than I had been when I cut my thumb.
What right did he have to pity me?
He was as *nif* as I was!
"Are we going to play or not?"
I asked,
waggling my fists above the little table.

With a lunge like a striking rattlesnake he grabbed my wrists.
"Open up," he ordered.

"Ow!"  I opened my hands.
The black pawn I had taken from the chessboard lay in my right palm.
Another black pawn,
the one I had spent the day carving,
lay in my left.

Razi laughed.
"I think I'll take white," he said,
letting go of my wrists.

"How did you know?"  I asked.

He grinned and pointed at the chessboard.
"You forgot to pick up a white one," he told me.
"If you're going to try to trick someone,
*la*,
you must learn to think more than one move ahead."
He scratched the side of his nose.
"For example, think about---what's her name? Hediyeh?"

"I'd rather not," I said sourly.
I had spent hours carving that pawn...

He shook his head.
"Eimin, just because you can't *drome*, it doesn't mean you're deaf and blind.
Look at pocket mice.
They can't *drome* either, but have you ever tried to sneak up on one?
They're always listening, always sniffing the air.
If you listen that hard and learn to pay attention,
no-one will ever be able to sneak up on you.
And if you learn to be as still inside as a piece of glass,
then one day maybe you will be able to sneak up on them."

"But how?"
I was so frustrated that my voice broke.

He shrugged his shoulders and twisted his right hand around,
all in one smooth motion.
Just like that he had a short, sharp knife in his hand.
The blade was blackened, but sunlight glinted on its edge.
"I can teach you, if you want."

I stared at it like a pocket mouse staring at a snake.
Razi was more than just a wandering *nif* tinker,
and he was offering me far more than I had realized I was bargaining for.

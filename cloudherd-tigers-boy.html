<p><em>Consider Cherne. A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight thousand gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to west. Its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean, whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Cherne's history began with the Pilot Angels, and nearly ended with them as well. Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a long Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass, and littered the land with strange magic. When it was over the Pilot Angels were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.</em></p>
<p><em>Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms and a girl is doing her chores. She is no longer a child but not yet an adult, and has no idea that her world is about to change forever...</em></p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-soldiers">Chapter 1: Soldiers</h2>
<p>Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale. Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the shadows of the twisted mountain pines.</p>
<p>&quot;Shoo.&quot; She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick. It waved its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a new home. Noxy cut its web's anchor threads with two practiced twists of her knife and began winding it onto a stick.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?&quot; Sensy asked.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced at her. &quot;Why? Are those ones coming loose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; Sensy looked down at her soft brown goofskin coat critically. &quot;They're just kind of plain. Granna Fee has some really nice red ones. She said she'd give them to me if I picked the stones out of her pepper garden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her whole garden? That would take forever.&quot; Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder. &quot;Why would you do all that work for buttons you don't need?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you're no help,&quot; Sensy pouted. She had spent the winter embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar. All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes, and her hair, and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale. Especially Rash---practically <em>anyone</em> would be more fun to be around than Rash.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes,&quot; Granna Fee had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who seemed to have taken her best friend's place.</p>
<p>&quot;Not me!&quot; Noxy had declared.</p>
<p>Her grandmother had laughed. &quot;No, daffodil, not you.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted, &quot;Soldiers! Soldiers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, wonderful,&quot; she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy. The whole point of going out to collect spiderwebs that morning had been to get <em>away</em> from the younger children for a few hours.</p>
<p>Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked himself up and ran over to the two girls. &quot;There's soldiers in the village!&quot; he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve. &quot;And they've been fighting! And there's a <em>tiger</em> with them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away. &quot;And there's a dragon under your bed.&quot; The mountains that lined the pass below Stale were still covered in snow. Avalanches happened almost every day---someone would have to be foolish <em>and</em> desperate to be on the road this early in the spring.</p>
<p>&quot;But they're <em>real</em>!&quot; Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to another. &quot;They've got swords, and some of them are bleeding! And the tiger can <em>talk</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth to say, &quot;Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?&quot; but a deep <em>boom boom</em> cut her off. She and Sensy looked at each other wide-eyed. <em>Boom boom</em>, pause. <em>Boom boom</em>, pause. It was Stale's home drum. It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed help to find their way home. It meant trouble.</p>
<p>Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch. &quot;Come on!&quot; she told Sensy.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you!&quot; Young Gas shouted behind them. &quot;Hey, wait for me!&quot;</p>
<p>The path was one of dozens that wound through the evergreen forest that surrounded Stale. Mud made it slippery where it wasn't slick with ice, but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the ridge above the village.</p>
<p>She paused to catch her breath. Below her lay the ancient walls of the fortress of Stale. Centuries of rain and snow had rounded the edges off the Pilot Angels' stonework, making it look like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as the mountains themselves. The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the walls like ducklings in a nest. Thin licks of smoke rose from their slate chimneys, while goof pens, vegetable plots, and racks laden with drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.</p>
<p>To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge. A net woven from squirrel spider thread was stretched over its top, as light as a dream but as strong as steel. Another net hung down at the gorge's mouth to make a gate. Inside, just visible from the ridge, two gray clouds floated half-asleep.</p>
<p>Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds, riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them. Grownups said this pair were slow and lazy, but they were the most exciting things in Noxy's world. They, and the herd of half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance, were the reason Stale existed.</p>
<p>Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her. &quot;Wait!&quot; her friend hissed, pointing into the trees. For a moment all Noxy saw was branches. Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and her mouth suddenly went dry.</p>
<p>As she and Sensy started to back up, one slow step at a time, Little Gas came pelting down the path behind them and ran straight into Noxy, nearly knocking her off her feet. &quot;Whoa!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;What's happening? Why did you---mmph!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't move!&quot; Noxy whispered, her hand clamped over his mouth. &quot;Just... don't move.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Young Gas could protest, the hairy creature who had been watching leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up into the tree. He paused for a moment to study the trio again, his fur more gray than brown and his eyes old and sad, then disappeared into the greenery.</p>
<p>Sensy was the first to speak. &quot;Wh-what's a troll doing <em>here</em>?&quot; she asked shakily.</p>
<p>Noxy shook her head. &quot;Worry about that later. Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>The drum had stopped booming by the time the three children reached the gap in the wall where an enormous counterbalanced stone door had hung centuries ago. The wooden replacement that Stale's current human inhabitants had put up in its place was as solid as they could make it, but still looked like a child's toy next to the Pilot Angels' ancient work.</p>
<p>Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the cobbled square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who had left a week ago for the snowfields to collect Stale's clouds from their winter pasture. Three hundred people, from babies in their mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, stood in a half-circle on one side of the square. A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front of them. They wore steel helmets with yellow feathers on their crests, and stiffened leather armor as thick as bootsoles that reached from their shoulders to their waists. Heavy wool kilts brushed against the tops of their sturdy knee-high leather boots. Each soldier had a sword in a scabbard on his hip and a pack on his back.</p>
<p>And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting. One man's hand was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling. None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.</p>
<p>But Noxy didn't see any of that right away. What she saw instead was the tiger. His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes, not orange and black like the picture in the book that three generations of village children had passed around. A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear, and his tail twitched slightly, as if the assembled villagers reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.</p>
<p>A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack as large as any of theirs. When he turned his head, Noxy saw four half-healed scars on his cheek, angry red against his near-black skin. His back was straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was because of the cold, weariness, fear, or all three, Noxy couldn't tell.</p>
<p>Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve. &quot;Who <em>are</em> they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know. &quot;I'm trying to hear!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the square. &quot;Friends,&quot; she said in a loud voice, patting the air with her hands to quiet the villagers. &quot;Friends, please. Thank you all for coming. I know it is early in the year for travellers, but please, bid welcome to Sergeant Dorbu, of the Angry Canary troop.&quot; The soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers.</p>
<p>&quot;And to the Gifted Kulbinder, also of the Angry Canaries,&quot; Indy continued, gesturing toward the tiger. &quot;They and their companions will be our guests for the next little while.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long's a little while?&quot; Aft asked loudly. Noxy winced. Aft had stayed in the village instead of going to round up other adults because his wife was expecting a baby. He was the best cloudherd in the village, at least in his own estimation, but had the manners of a constipated goof.</p>
<p>&quot;Until they are ready to travel again,&quot; Indy reassured him. Her eyes swept across the crowd. &quot;Their journey has been a hard one---they hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans. Sergeant? Would you like to say a few words?&quot;</p>
<p>The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as Indy stepped down. Like the rest of the soldiers, his skin was black compared to the villagers' dark brown, and his wiry hair was trimmed to a thin fuzz. Two yellow ribbons, exactly the same color as the feathers in his helmet, ringed his left sleeve.</p>
<p>He smiled at the villagers and opened his mouth to speak, but Aft spoke again before he could get a word out. &quot;You lot loyalists?&quot; the cloudherd asked loudly.</p>
<p>&quot;Give the man a chance to speak!&quot; Grappa Gas said just as loudly, rapping his cane against his wooden leg. He and his son glared at each other.</p>
<p>&quot;You two behave,&quot; Granna Fee scolded them. Noxy's grandmother was a head shorter than either of the men, but the iron in her voice quieted them both down. She nodded at the sergeant. &quot;Go ahead, young man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, thank you, respected&quot; the soldier said gratefully. &quot;And thank you, people of Stale. As your mayor said, my comrades and I were trying to see if the pass to Chaghan was clear yet. We---&quot; He paused for a moment before continuing. &quot;We were attacked three days ago and driven off the road into the forest. Everything seemed all right at first, but then the forest must have spoken to the trolls and...&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Well, you can probably guess what happened next.&quot;</p>
<p>Voices murmured. The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso Mountains from wheat fields of Uws in the south to Garheim's frigid shores in the north and the Ninety Kingdoms in the west. It wasn't as cruel as the Jungle of Thind, but it guarded its territory and privileges as jealously as a bear guarded her cubs. Gifted creatures that wanted to live in the forest had to do her bidding. And humans were not welcome inside its borders at all, not unless they stuck to the handful of roads built long ago by the Pilot Angels. Travellers who strayed were rarely given warnings, and <em>never</em> given second chances.</p>
<p>A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he continued. &quot;We finally made it back to the road, but the worst of our hurt couldn't keep going, so we left them in camp with a few of the able-bodied and came here looking for help. They won't be able to keep the trolls at bay for long.&quot;</p>
<p>Aft broke the silence that followed. &quot;So which side of the fight <em>are</em> you on?&quot; he asked, his voice still belligerent but three notches less rude than it had been.</p>
<p>&quot;I have the privilege of serving Her Highness, Princess Shudarga,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu said calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Rebels...&quot; breathed a voice behind Noxy. She and Sensy jumped and spun around. Rash had sidled up behind the two girls, but instead of poking them in the ribs as he usually would, he had been listening to the soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;Goof,&quot; Sensy muttered, punching his arm before turning her back on him. Rash grinned at Noxy, who scowled in return and pointedly turned her back on him as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Does that mean King Denpa's boys are going to come calling after you?&quot; Grappa Gas demanded, waving down his son before Aft could speak again. As with everything else, they had chosen opposite sides when Princess Shudarga raised her flag the previous summer. &quot;Because if they do, these walls won't keep 'em out for long, and neither will we.&quot;</p>
<p>The smile slipped from the sergeant's face. Noxy suddenly saw how weary he was. &quot;We didn't choose Stale for its walls, respected. We didn't choose it at all. We just washed up here because we couldn't go any further. Our friends need help. If you're afraid that'll bring trouble, we'll understand if you send us on our way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is turning anyone away,&quot; Indy said firmly. &quot;We mountain folk take pride in our hospitality. We may not have much, but I'm sure we can find some spare blankets to keep you warm and stretch our stores enough to feed you for a few days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, respected,&quot; the sergeant said, bowing again. &quot;But what we really want right now is a couple of clouds so we can go and rescue our friends.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-not-quite-what-we-were-expecting">Chapter 2: Not Quite What We Were Expecting</h2>
<p>The next five minutes were chaos. Out of the question, Grappa Gas said, whacking his wooden leg with his cane to emphasize his points. The law might forgive them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who wandered in out of the cold, even if they were rebels, but flying off to rescue their friends? Why, when the <em>tralpa</em> came back---</p>
<p>---they'd show him the gate and send him on his way, Aft cut in, arms crossed and brows knotted. The lazy good-for-nothing had run for the capital the day word of the rebellion had reached the mountains, and hadn't been seen since. As far as Aft was concerned, he'd given up any right he might once have had to rent laws to anyone. Anyway, if they were going to shelter rebels, the king wouldn't care if they'd come to Stale or Stale had gone to them. And anyway again, what would other cloudherds say if they heard that Stalers had left men in the forest to die? Angels' names, what would their own folk say when they got back from up the mountain?</p>
<p>The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones. Little whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart as people overheard neighbors they disagreed with, or turned around to agree with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet another &quot;but what if?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is going to go on forever,&quot; Noxy said sourly. &quot;They all know they're going to do whatever my <em>amma</em> want to do in the end---why don't they just get on with it?&quot; She, Sensy, and Rash had stayed aloof on the sidelines, old enough that they hadn't grown bored and run off with Young Gas and the other children, but young enough that the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.</p>
<p>Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a mustache. It had become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had told him countless times he ought to break before <em>someone</em> broke his stupid finger. &quot;What I want to know is whether we're going to get to go, or if we're going to be stuck here with the littles. Again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we'll get to go!&quot; Noxy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Rash raised an eyebrow, another annoying trick he had developed while his broken leg had been healing through the winter.</p>
<p>Noxy puffed an annoyed breath, biting off her &quot;of course I'm sure!&quot; when she caught Sensy's uncertain look. &quot;Wait here,&quot; she said with a scowl.</p>
<p>She strode toward the center of the square, slowing as she neared the speaker's stone. Her mother was speaking intently with the sergeant. The tiger sat impassively on his haunches next to them, his tail twitching occasionally. The boy with the scarred face still stood beside him, his pack on the ground. He looked like he was beyond exhausted, but when his eyelids started to droop, the tiger growled quietly and he snapped to attention again.</p>
<p>Noxy's mother caught sight of her. &quot;Oh, and this is my daughter, Probably Noxious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Respected Noxious.&quot; The sergeant bowed slightly.</p>
<p>Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was immediately annoyed at herself. Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a silly lowlander custom. &quot;Just call me Noxy,&quot; she told him. &quot;<em>Amma</em>, which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on? We can go and start getting them ready while everyone's still jawing.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well. &quot;Who said anything about you three going?&quot;</p>
<p>But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and had assembled her arguments as she crossed the square. They were definitely old enough---why, they were all going to be riding <em>real</em> clouds in a few weeks, not just tame old pair floating about in the cloud pen. And they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down the pass, and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do rescues, wasn't it? And---</p>
<p>&quot;Stop.&quot; Her mother held up a hand, not noticing or just ignoring the grin that had quirked the corner of Sergeant Dorbu's mouth. &quot;You can go. But!&quot; she continued, &quot;But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna Fee, and that's all you do---ride. Understood?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded obediently. &quot;Yes, <em>amma</em>.&quot; She had learned the hard way not to keep asking for a whole orange when she'd already talked her mother into a half.</p>
<p>It only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed. Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and more than one tinker or trader had needed to be lifted out of a difficult spot after running into a bear or being set upon by trolls. Coils of hemp rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen, and everyone kept an extra goofskin cap somewhere handy, just in case.</p>
<p>&quot;You look ridiculous,&quot; Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the wooden steps to the mounting platform. He had been learning to embroider during that winter's enforced idleness, and had stitched what he claimed were eagle's wings onto the side flaps of his cap.</p>
<p>Rash looked her up and down. &quot;Really? Because I think you look amazing. Excuse me.&quot; He winked at Noxy and stepped around the speechless 13-year-old to take his place on the platform.</p>
<p>&quot;Ears all!&quot; Aft called out, clapping his hands. Despite the cold, he was only wearing a sleeveless goofskin vest, knee-length wool shorts, and a sturdy pair of boots. His hair was pulled back in a thick club braid, a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven into it for luck. &quot;You know how this is done. I'm fore on Big Blue, Gas and Fee will have Pillow for spotter. We'll down, lift, and out, quick and simple, and get our new friends back here for soup before you can sneeze. No adventures, right?&quot; He turned a steely glare toward Noxy, Sensy, and Rash, who nodded and mumbled, &quot;No adventures.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; And without anything more than that he walked out to the end of the plank that stuck out three strides from the platform, looked down to check that Big Blue was below him, and jumped.</p>
<p>Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath. One, two, three... Big Blue dimpled under Aft's weight as the burly cloudherd hit him dead center. Gray waves rippled out across the cloud's back as Aft rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly. Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount, rousing it from its winter half-sleep.</p>
<p>Something twinged in the back of her head. She blinked, momentarily disoriented. &quot;Did you say something?&quot; she asked Sensy.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.</p>
<p>&quot;I said---never mind.&quot; Noxy shook her head. &quot;Look, he's coming up.&quot;</p>
<p>Big Blue rose slowly toward the platform, bunching up into a firmer mass as he came. Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the cloud's back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it. A silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, cawing its displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away.</p>
<p>Aft looked up and smiled the smile he only ever wore when he was on cloudback or had his arm around his wife. &quot;You want me to get Pillow for you?&quot; he called up to his father.</p>
<p>&quot;No need, I can---damn that boy!&quot; Grappa Gas harrumphed as Aft took three long steps across Big Blue's back and launched himself into the air again.</p>
<p>Rash whistled. &quot;Nice leap,&quot; he said appreciatively as Aft landed right in the middle of Pillow. &quot;And blind, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not such a trick,&quot; Noxy said dismissively, though she was secretly impressed. &quot;He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, but would you trust a cloud's directions that much?&quot; Rash challenged her. &quot;Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out of what they say.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. She had realized early in their training that mind-talking was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash, or even for some of the olders who were already riding. She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing off. The only person she shared her progress with now was Granna Fee, and even she didn't---</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em> She winced and put her hand on the back of her head. There it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?</p>
<p>This time Sensy noticed. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Noxy lied. One of the few things Aft and Grappa Gas agreed on was that cloudherds shouldn't fly if they were sick, but she wasn't going to admit anything that might mean being left behind. &quot;Come on, let's go.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas made everyone wait until Big Blue was only a couple of strides below the mounting platform before he let them jump on. The three teenagers had been doing it since they were little children, but the brief moment of flight and <em>poof!</em> as they landed still made them all whoop. Grappa Gas landed beside them a moment later, and Granna Fee a moment after that. &quot;Oof,&quot; she grunted, rolling over and sitting up. &quot;That's not as soft as it used to be.&quot; But then she smiled like the girl she had once been and put her arm around Noxy so that her granddaughter could lean against her the way she had so many times before.</p>
<p>Behind them, Rash nudged Sensy with his elbow. &quot;You can lean on me if you get cold, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Sensy sniffed. &quot;I don't expect I'll ever get <em>that</em> cold.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee pressed her hand against Big Blue and closed her eyes. The cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the spiderweb gate that hung down over mouth of the gorge. As he moved away from the platform, Pillow rose to take his place. Two of Stale's other oldsters clambered aboard, too stiff or serious to jump.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll take lead,&quot; Aft called.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I heard you the first time,&quot; Granna Fee muttered under her breath. She slowed Big Blue so that Pillow could pass. As she did so, Aft took the ox horn from his belt and blew three loud notes, low high low.</p>
<p>Indy blew an answering note from her seat above the cloud pen gate. &quot;Now comes the hard part,&quot; she told Sergeant Dorbu. He, the tiger, and the tiger's boy had come with her to see off the rescue party. Instead of taking them with the others, she had led them up a steep flight of stairs cut into the rock to a smaller square platform, where she had seated herself on a sturdy little stool supported by a single post. As the clouds approached the gate, she put her feet on the pedals that stuck out of the post and began pumping.</p>
<p>With a long squeak of protest, the spiderweb gate drew back so that the clouds could get by. &quot;Saves us having to re-frib the curtain every time someone comes in or out,&quot; she puffed. &quot;And it's half the time.&quot; She paused to wave Pillow and Big Blue's riders as they drifted out of the pen and turned upwind.</p>
<p>&quot;But twice the work, I'm guessing,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu said sympathetically. &quot;Want me to wind it back?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Oh, no, that's all right.&quot; Indy started pedalling again. &quot;The exercise keeps me fit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mm,&quot; the sergeant said, eyeing her. When the tiger rumbled deep in his throat, Sergeant Dorbu put on his most innocent expression. The tiger's boy just rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>Cloudherding is cold work, even in the summer. In the spring, in the mountains, when breath still fogs and the wind pokes its fingers through every loose seam and down every collar, it's beyond freezing. A hundred heartbeats after they left the cloud pen, Granna Fee had wrapped a fleece around herself and her granddaughter, leaving only their faces exposed. Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy said, he might be a goof, but at least he was a <em>warm</em> goof.</p>
<p>Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected. &quot;Saints and their inventions, but I miss this,&quot; he sighed. He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden leg on so that it wouldn't poke into Big Blue, but was dressed in the same long coat and scarf that he had been wearing when the soldiers arrived. &quot;Look, the condors are back in their nest! We should invite them them to visit some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're not really the most sociable of creatures,&quot; Granna Fee said dryly.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas harrumphed. &quot;You just have to get to know them. I wonder if any of their chicks will be Gifted this year? That would be a thing, wouldn't it? Oh, and down there, is that---saints, is that a person down there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; Noxy pushed the heavy fleece aside and scrambled to the cloud's leading edge. &quot;I don't see, where?&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas shook his head. &quot;Sorry, girl, it was just a troll.&quot; He patted her shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone needs to remember to wear his glasses when he's out and about,&quot; Granna Fee sniffed pointedly. Grappa Gas harrumphed again, but didn't reply.</p>
<p>It had taken Sergeant Dorbu and his men a day to hike up the pass to Stale Leftovers. The Staler cloudherds covered the same distance in less than half an hour, even with the headwind. &quot;There,&quot; Granna Fee said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas frowned. &quot;I thought he said there were just a few of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee frowned too. &quot;Maybe 'a few' means something different to lowlanders.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose like an island out of the forest. Two dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire. Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw a handful of men moving about, some propped against one another to stay upright.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas gave a low whistle. &quot;Aft's not going to like this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither is my daughter,&quot; Granna Fee replied, shaking her head.</p>
<p>One of the injured soldiers spotted the clouds a few minutes later. The cloudherds were too far away to hear his shouts, but there was no mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms. Other soldiers crawled out of their tents and began waving and shouting as well as Aft steered Pillow in a long arc to the upwind side of the rocky outcrop. After a brief discussion that mostly consisted of interrupting each other, Granna Fee and Grappa Gas had Big Blue hover directly above the camp.</p>
<p>&quot;You lot keep your eyes wide,&quot; Grappa Gas ordered the teenagers curtly. &quot;Forest might be happy to have us take them, or it might not.&quot;</p>
<p>Pillow descended until she bumped against the northern edge of the rock, her upper side level with its top. The two older cloudherds riding with Aft stayed on board while he strode forward, barking orders to hurry the soldiers along. Only a few wind-borne words reached Noxy, but that was enough for her to know that he was telling the injured men to leave their gear, to leave their tents, to leave everything they couldn't pick up <em>right away</em>.</p>
<p>Limping and stumbling in singles and pairs, the men began to clamber onto Pillow's back. The older cloudherds helped the worst injured, and had others move apart to keep their weight balanced. As they were doing this, one of the soldiers stopped in front of Aft and began to argue, pointing at a larger tent set up a short distance away from the others. Other soldiers joined in, until Aft was partly surrounded by a half-circle of angry men.</p>
<p>Finally he threw up his hands in surrender. Taking the horn from his belt, he blew two long notes, then windmilled his arm and pointed to Pillow.</p>
<p>&quot;No no no,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered. &quot;You can take them all, lad, just get them loaded up and get out of there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? What's happening?&quot; Noxy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;He wants us to come in behind him and take some of them,&quot; Grappa Gas told her angrily. &quot;But look---over there!&quot;</p>
<p>Something brown flashed between two trees a dozen strides into the forest. Something else---something much larger---briefly let itself be seen a few strides further away. In singles and pairs and packs, the forest was mustering its servants.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas spat over Big Blue's side. &quot;Forest is holding back for now,&quot; he said. &quot;But we go in, it'll be on us like an avalanche.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not your decision to make,&quot; Granna Fee told him. &quot;Aft's riding fore on this one, and---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;---and you follow your fore. I know, I know. Saints.&quot; Grappa Gas looked like he wanted to spit again, but instead he placed his palm on Big Blue and closed his eyes. A moment later the cloud began to descend.</p>
<p>Granna Fee looked at the three teenagers. &quot;You shout as soon as you see anything, you hear me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, granna,&quot; Sensy said as Rash and Noxy nodded.</p>
<p>Five heartbeats, ten... They were level with the camp. Grappa Gas steered them slowly across the wind toward Pillow's side. The soldiers watched them approach without expression, too weak and weary to be amazed at the sight. &quot;Hurry it up!&quot; Aft bellowed at the half dozen who had dragged long canvas-wrapped packages out of the large tent and were staggering back through camp with them over their shoulders. He leaped onto Pillow. A moment later the cloud lifted off, clearing space for Big Blue.</p>
<p>The larger cloud touched down with a bump. An instant later something roared in the forest behind them. Noxy jumped. Sensy shrieked and Grappa Gas cursed as a brown bear charged out of the trees and halted a stone's throw away. It reared up on its hind legs and roared again. Another bear joined it, then a cougar, and then---</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; Noxy breathed. There were trolls in the trees, a dozen, two, three, a whole troop of them. They began hooting, shaking the branches around them until it looked like the entire forest had come alive.</p>
<p>The first of the soldiers reached them. He stumbled at the edge of the rocky outcrop and fell forward onto Big Blue, the package on his shoulder landing heavily beside him. The others were right behind him. &quot;Come on come on come <em>on</em>!&quot; Grappa Gas urged them.</p>
<p>A stone flew through the air, then another. Suddenly the air was full of flying rocks. A soldier staggered and went down as one hit his head. Another struck Noxy hard in the back. She ducked and covered her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Hang on!&quot; Grappa Gas shouted. Big Blue surged upward so suddenly that Noxy was knocked off her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Look out!&quot; Rash yelled, grabbing Sensy's arm and pulling her back as the cougar leaped up at them. The two teens fell together in a heap on the cloud. The cougar snarled with disappointment as it missed the edge of the cloud by a palm's width.</p>
<p>Higher, higher... Noxy let out her breath, only then realizing that she'd been holding it. &quot;That was close,&quot; she said shakily.</p>
<p>&quot;Too close. Too <em>damned</em> close!&quot; Grappa Gas rounded on the nearest soldier. &quot;We could have been dinner, all of us, and for what? What was so aching important you just couldn't leave it behind!?&quot; He poked at the long bundle beside the soldier with his cane.</p>
<p>The soldier looked at him bleakly. &quot;Our mates. Those as didn't make it. We promised we'd give 'em a decent send-off.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas froze, then lowered his cane. &quot;Ah. Sorry, lad. I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier nodded. &quot;Me too.&quot; Behind them, the forest's creatures had already started tearing every man-made thing in the camp to pieces.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-arguments-and-pursuit">Chapter 3: Arguments and Pursuit</h2>
<p>They hardly said a word on the way back to Stale. One of the soldiers even fell asleep, snoring on one of his companions' shoulders. The others watched the mountains go by with only an occasional flicker of interest.</p>
<p>With her hand on Big Blue's back, Noxy could feel how unhappy the cloud was. It wasn't just that he was carrying strangers, or that those strangers were bleeding and miserable. When clouds died, they just spread out into nothing. The thought that something could end but still be there---that it could go from being alive to being like a rock or a log---made the five canvas-wrapped bodies frightening in a way that storm winds and lightning couldn't match.</p>
<p><em>Sh, sh, sh,</em> Noxy mind-spoke soothingly, stroking the cloud as if he was an overgrown house cat. <em>Home soon, then rest.</em> At that moment, she wanted it just as much as the skittish cloud.</p>
<p>Aft brought Pillow down in a clearing in front of the village's main gate. It hadn't been cut back since the previous autumn, but only a few ferns and flowers stuck up out of the rocky soil. The soldiers he had picked up slid off the cloud in ones and twos. Some managed to keep their feet under themselves, but others stumbled onto one knee or landed on their backsides. Under normal circumstances, the villagers would have made jokes or applauded particularly clumsy dismounts. There was no joking this time, though. Instead, people came forward to offer them men blankets and fleeces, or helped them stand and then stepped back, unsure what to do next.</p>
<p>Indy didn't let the Stalers stand idle for long---she never did. &quot;Get these ones up to the traders' hall,&quot; she ordered one group crisply. &quot;And get a couple of pots of stew going---and some tea. You do drink tea, don't you?&quot; She moved on without waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu was there as well. He had traded his helmet for a knitted cap, black with a pair of yellow stripes to match those on his sleeves, but still wore his armor. He clapped one man on the shoulder, steadied a second leaning on a makeshift crutch, and bowed his head when a third told him who hadn't made it through the night.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's the tiger?&quot; Rash asked, shading his eyes with his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Up on the wall,&quot; Sensy said, pointing.</p>
<p>Noxy shaded her own eyes. Kulbinder was sitting on his hindquarters high above the crowd with his boy beside him. Suddenly the tiger raised his head and looked straight at them---straight at <em>her</em>. She shivered with more than just the cold.</p>
<p>As the last soldier exchanged a salute with Sergeant Dorbu, Aft blew a long note on his signal horn. Pillow lifted off a moment later and turned toward the cloud pen.</p>
<p>&quot;Back up, you lot,&quot; Grappa Gas ordered. &quot;I'm going to bring this one down.&quot; He gave the three teenagers a moment, then closed his eyes and ordered Big Blue down.</p>
<p>They bumped once as they landed. &quot;Whoops,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered, coloring slightly at the look Granna Fee gave him. &quot;All right. What do you say we get this done and go find something warm to drink?&quot;</p>
<p>It took a few moments for the soldiers to slide the bodies they had brought down the cloud's flank into their waiting comrades' arms. When a couple of villagers offered to help, Sergeant Dorbu shook his head politely but firmly. &quot;These are ours,&quot; he said firmly. &quot;Though we'd be grateful if you could gather some wood for a pyre---we'd like to send them off tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>And then suddenly it was over. Noxy found herself standing next to her friends, both feet on the ground, watching Grappa Gas and Granna Fee lift off to take Big Blue back to the cloud pen. A handful of Stalers were milling about, but the soldiers and everyone else was already back inside the walls. Even the tiger and his boy had disappeared off the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Noxy said awkwardly, not sure what to do next. &quot;I guess I'll go see if my <em>amma</em> has any chores for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If she doesn't, you can do some of mine,&quot; Rash replied, as he had a hundred times before. He glanced at Sensy. &quot;I guess we should to be useful too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess,&quot; she said casually. &quot;See you later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You too.&quot; Whatever else Noxy might have said was cut off by a now-familiar twinge in the back of her head. A heartbeat later she head the staccato blatting of Aft's horn, the quick, angry pattern that meant 'back away and give me some room'. She caught her breath. She had <em>known</em> one of the clouds was upset even before she'd heard the horn---but how?</p>
<p>Her mother was still organizing people in the square. Yes, the soldiers would stay in the trading hall, she'd already said that. Yes, the wounded---where else would they go? And yes, there <em>were</em> a lot more than 'a few' of them, but there was nothing they could do about that now.</p>
<p>Indy caught sight of her daughter. &quot;It will have to wait, daffodil,&quot; she said as Noxy opened her mouth. &quot;Right now I want you to go home and make some tea. Use the big pot, and all the honey we have left. I have the feeling we're going to have lots of visitors...&quot;</p>
<p>The water hadn't even boiled before Grappa Gas showed up. He rapped on the door with his cane and entered without waiting for a hello. &quot;Hey, lass. Where's your mother?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She should be back soon,&quot; Noxy said. She added a handful of tea leaves to the cinnamon bark and green cardamom pods already in the pot. It was an extravagance---the pack traders who brought such delicacies to the village wouldn't start visiting until the last of the snow had melted, which was at least another month away---but Granna Fee had always said that a good cup of tea was worth a thousand words.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind if I sit?&quot; Grappa Gas settled himself on a stool that was at least as old as he was and watched Noxy drizzle the last of the honey into the pot.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you find out?&quot; Noxy asked after a moment.</p>
<p>The old man snorted. &quot;Just like your mother, aren't you? And your granna, too. Always thinking one step ahead of everyone else.&quot; He smiled. &quot;You know, if your granna hadn't been so smart, I might've wound up being your grappa. I remember once when---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa!&quot; Noxy cut him off, exasperated and amused at the same time. &quot;Tell me what the soldiers said!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how do you know they said anything?&quot; Grappa Gas challenged her.</p>
<p>&quot;Because they're a long way from home, and tired, and sore, and want us all to like them,&quot; Indy answered, closing the front door behind her as she came in. &quot;And because I saw you duck into the trading hall on your way down from the cloud pen. Now, what did you find out?&quot; She kissed the old man on his grizzled cheek and sat on the other stool.</p>
<p>For a moment all Grappa Gas could think of was how alike mother and daughter were. Noxy's hair might be brown and wavy instead of straight and black, and her face square instead of round, but they had the same quick minds. When Indy had turned ten, he had predicted that she would be mayor before she was thirty. <em>Better start telling everyone that Noxy's going to take the job too,</em> he thought.</p>
<p>&quot;The king's men hit them while they were crossing the ford near Tastes Like Duck Droppings,&quot; he told Indy. &quot;Just bad luck, but they were split between the two sides of the river when they were attacked.&quot; His face darkened. &quot;Fellow I spoke to said the king's troops must have had a magician with them, because their tiger didn't catch wind of them until it was too late. He doesn't expect expect he'll see many of his friends again.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy glanced at Noxy. &quot;This doesn't go out of this house,&quot; she warned. Noxy nodded, turning to the stove as the lid on the kettle began to whistle. She lifted it carefully with a pair of sticks to pour the boiling water into the tea, then replaced it on the stove and set the teapot on the table to steep.</p>
<p>&quot;Was there anything else?&quot; Indy asked.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas frowned. &quot;They didn't say it, but King Denpa's winning. And about time, too---he's got help now from half his neighbors, all worried that Shudarga's craziness might be contagious. If you ask me---&quot;</p>
<p>The front door banged open. Aft strode in and glared at Indy. &quot;How soon are they leaving?&quot; he demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, good day to you too,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered.</p>
<p>Aft ignored his father. &quot;How soon, Indy? You know you can't let them stay.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy stood up slowly. &quot;Make yourself comfortable,&quot; she said, gesturing at her stool. &quot;Noxy, go get the peeling stool from out back. Brush it off before you bring it in the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Aft glowered at Indy a moment longer, then sat down opposite his father. The short stool creaked in protest under his weight. Noxy set down the peeling stool she had fetched for her mother, then began pouring tea as inconspicuously as she could while Aft counted off the reasons the rebels couldn't stay. What if the king sent an army after them? Wait, what did he mean &quot;if&quot;, of course he would. There were only three hundred people in Stale, and only half a dozen of them had ever held a sword. Not that they <em>had</em> any swords. And even if they had---</p>
<p>&quot;I'm surprised to hear you say all this,&quot; Indy interrupted. &quot;I thought if anyone would take their side, it would be you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes, of course I do,&quot; Aft blustered. &quot;The sooner leeches like the <em>tralpa</em> have to start earning an honest living like the rest of us, the better. But---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it's different when someone's actually on your doorstep, isn't it?&quot; Grappa Gas shook his head pityingly.</p>
<p>Aft clenched his hands into fists. &quot;Of course it's different. The baby could come any day now. If the king's men come looking for this lot--- if there's a fight---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; Indy slapped the table with her hand. &quot;Enough, both of you. We have a stormload of trouble to fly through, and I will <em>not</em> have you two making it worse with your bickering.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy set a steaming mug of tea in front of her and two others in front of Grappa Gas and his son. Indy stared into hers as if hoping the tiny swirling leaves might spell out some answers. &quot;I know it's a big thing,&quot; she went on quietly. &quot;And I did think about turning them away, but look at them. They look like they've been through the Blight. If a storm caught them in the pass, they wouldn't even make it as far as Makes Your Breath Rancid. How would that make us look?&quot;</p>
<p>Aft scowled. &quot;What people think won't matter much if we've all had our throats cut. No, wait, hear me out.&quot; He slurped his tea and set the cup down with a clatter. &quot;What we just did, saving travellers who got caught on the mountain, we can explain that if we have to. But letting them stay here---saints and all their gifts, Indy, we can't. We just can't. It wouldn't be safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For once, I agree with you.&quot; Grappa Gas slurped his own tea with a scowl. &quot;Never mind the trouble it'll bring when the king wins---yes, I said <em>when</em>, and you know as well as I do that's what's going to happen---never mind the trouble, it's three dozen mouths to feed when we're already down to dried apples and barley.&quot;</p>
<p>Aft snorted. &quot;Never mind the tiger. What are we supposed to feed it? Or should I ask 'who'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Disgusting Aftertaste!&quot; Indy snapped. &quot;I will <em>not</em> have that kind of talk about one of the Gifted. Especially not in front of my daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmph!&quot; Aft snorted. &quot;All I can say is, let's hope there isn't a late storm, because if there is, <em>I'm</em> going to be keeping <em>my</em> family behind a good strong door.&quot; He swallowed the rest of his tea in one gulp, stood, and nodded a curt goodbye to Noxy, and slammed the door as he left.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if you were right!&quot; Grappa Gas called out. &quot;Maybe we'd have some peace and quiet around here if a few of us <em>did</em> get eaten!&quot; He turned back to Indy. &quot;Don't worry about him---he's just worried about the baby.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Indy smiled. &quot;But I appreciate you saying it.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas drained the last of his tea in one long gulp. &quot;It's good,&quot; he said to Noxy. &quot;Maybe wants more cinnamon next time, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll try to remember,&quot; Noxy promised.</p>
<p>Indy stood when Grappa Gas did. &quot;Will you stay for dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &quot;Thanks, girl, but I promised your mother I'd help her, um, peel some potatoes.&quot; He winked, ignoring Noxy's little 'eww' of disgust. Indy smiled and kissed him on the cheek again. He was humming as he left.</p>
<p>Noxy waited until her mother said down again before saying, &quot;<em>Amma</em>...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, daffodil?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy hesitated. She didn't know where to start. &quot;Do you think the king really is going to come looking for them?&quot;</p>
<p>Indy sighed. &quot;I hope not. But what I really hope is that they aren't here long enough for us to have to worry about that.&quot;</p>
<p>When Princess Shudarga had marched on the capital the previous summer, Grappa Gas had demanded that the cloudherds do their best to drown her troops. Aft had argued just as loudly that they should support the rebellion. After all, what had the king's <em>tralpa</em> done for them except take half of what they brought home at the end of every summer and tell them they couldn't build a bigger fishpond? As the arguments grew more heated, Indy had put on her collar, called everyone together, and laid down the law. This was the lowlanders' fight. The people of Stale Leftovers were <em>not</em> going to take either side, not while she was mayor, and if anyone didn't like it, they could have an election right then and there to sort it out. Anyone? No? All right, then, why didn't everyone get back to their chores, because they weren't going to do themselves.</p>
<p>The two sat in silence for a moment. Finally Indy stretched. &quot;So tell me, did you collect some spiderwebs, or did you and Sensy spend the whole day mooning after Rash?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Amma</em>! And how can you think about spiderwebs on a day like this? And anyway, Sensy's the one who's mooning after Rash and that stupid moustache he's trying to grow. <em>I</em> think it's dumb.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so.&quot; Indy raised her arms and stretched. &quot;Now, what are we---&quot;</p>
<p><em>Crash!</em> Mother and daughter jumped as something landed on the roof above their heads, sending tiles skittering down to shatter on the cobblestones outside. A low, menacing yowl sent ice up Noxy's spine.</p>
<p>&quot;What in the names...?&quot; Indy crossed the floor in three steps and threw open the door just in time to see a troll land in the narrow street in front of their house. She yelped and flung herself to the side as the hairy creature lunged past her and raced up the stairs on all fours.</p>
<p>The tiger hit the cobblestones a heartbeat later. &quot;Which way did it go?&quot; he demanded, his ears back and his tail lashing.</p>
<p>The sound of a window shutter being flung open upstairs answered his question before Indy could. &quot;Wait, stop!&quot; She held up a hand before the tiger could move. &quot;What in the saints' names are you <em>doing</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was spying on us!&quot; the tiger snarled. &quot;Now let me pass!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; As the tiger came forward, Indy stepped into the doorway to block him.</p>
<p>He pulled up short with a snarl. &quot;I said <em>let me pass!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I said <em>no!</em>&quot; The mayor of Stale glared at the cat, her eyes flashing with the same angry light that lit his. &quot;This is <em>our</em> village, and you will <em>not</em> race around like a madman unless <em>I</em> say so, is that clear?&quot;</p>
<p>It was the bravest thing Noxy had ever seen her mother do, and for one long moment, she was sure it would be the last. The muscles in the tiger's shoulders bunched. He braced his legs to charge---and then, just as suddenly, relaxed.</p>
<p>&quot;As you say,&quot; he growled, his tail still twitching. &quot;But I still want to know who that damn chimpanzee was spying for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We call them 'trolls' here,&quot; Indy said, her voice still full of steel. &quot;They're our neighbors. And I imagine he was doing what any neighbor would do if a bunch of strangers showed up next door---having a look to see what's going on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was a troll up by the spiderweb orchard this morning,&quot; Noxy said, immediately wishing she hadn't when two heads turned to stare at her. &quot;Sensy and I---we saw it when were coming back down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How come you didn't tell me?&quot; her mother demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been kind of busy!&quot; Noxy said defensively. &quot;Anyway, it wasn't the same one. It was older. A lot older.&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger sat on his haunches. &quot;Is this normal here? Chimp---<em>trolls</em> coming this close to a human settlement? Because they very much keep to themselves in Thind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it's not normal,&quot; Indy said. She uncrossed her arms and gestured. &quot;But if we're going to talk about it, would you like to come in?&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger regarded her coolly for a moment, then blinked and looked away. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, his voice calm once again. &quot;Perhaps some other time. I should see if the sergeant needs me.&quot; And without any more goodbye than that, he rose and loped away.</p>
<p>Noxy let out her breath in a long whoosh. &quot;Well,&quot; she said shakily. &quot;That wasn't scary at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mother sat back down on her stool and squeezed her daughter's hand. &quot;Hardly at all,&quot; she agreed. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded. &quot;Sure,&quot; she lied.</p>
<p>Indy squeezed her hand again, then got up to close the door. &quot;Good. Let's scramble some eggs and call it a day.&quot; She took down their one frying pan and set it on the stove beside the kettle. &quot;Tomorrow, I'm going to see if I can get to know the sergeant a little better. And I think you ought to get to know the tiger's boy. Let's see if we can find out if they have any other surprises tucked away.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-getting-to-know-you">Chapter 4: Getting To Know You</h2>
<p>&quot;Oh Noxy, brush your hair!&quot; Indy set her tea down on the table and began to stand.</p>
<p>&quot;I can do it,&quot; Noxy protested. &quot;I'm not a baby.&quot; She dragged the brush she and her mother shared through her hair another few times. &quot;Is that better?&quot;</p>
<p>Her mother sighed, just as her own mother once had. &quot;Yes, I suppose. Honestly, someone would think you'd been possessed by lightning. Now let's get going. We don't want to keep them waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>They walked through the village together, squinting against the sharp-edged morning sun. The air smelled of pine smoke and fried eggs. People were sitting in twos and threes on stools outside their houses wearing goofskin jackets or thick sweaters above sturdy trousers and sturdier boots. The men knitted or peeled potatoes while the women picked spiderwebs apart apart and wound the strands onto spools.</p>
<p>Indy had to stop to answer the same questions every dozen strides. How were the soldiers getting on? What did they think of the village? &quot;We're on our way to ask,&quot; she replied over and over again.</p>
<p>Many of the village's elders didn't bother to hide their unhappiness about their guests, but the only really sour face was Aft's. &quot;Has that tiger eaten anyone yet?&quot; he asked, forcing an awl through a scrap of leather. &quot;Or is he too busy racing around on rooftops?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy felt nearly frantic with impatience by the time she and her mother reached the trading hall where the soldiers had spent the night. She knew that talking to people was the most important part of being mayor, and her mother liked doing it anyway, but what if someone else was already showing the tiger's boy around the village?</p>
<p>She needn't have worried. Sergeant Dorbu was sitting on the guesthouse steps with the village's children cross-legged on the stones in front of him. Sensy and Rash looked up as Noxy arrived. Noxy blinked. Had they been holding hands?</p>
<p>&quot;And this is called a greave,&quot; the sergeant said, pointing at the armored front of his boot. &quot;It's to protect me from vampire mice. See?&quot; He tapped it with his fingernail, <em>clunk</em>. &quot;They could bite that if they wanted, but all they'd do is blunt their teeth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What if they climbed up your leg?&quot; asked Sensy. Noxy rolled her eyes. Sensy could always be counted on to ask the questions grownups wanted to hear.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, well, then I'd---oh, hello, mayor.&quot; The sergeant stood up, brushing his hands on his kilt. &quot;The boy will be out in a heartbeat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, sergeant,&quot; said Indy. &quot;My daughter is looking forward to showing him the village. I trust you slept well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; said the sergeant. &quot;Although I...&quot; He blinked, then sniffed, then started to say, &quot;Excuse me,&quot; but the sneeze came first. <em>Hwah!</em> One of the younger children giggled, then clapped her hand over her mouth. The sergeant blinked and sniffed again. &quot;Sorry---too many nights in the rain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Visitors from down below often catch colds in our thin air,&quot; said Indy sympathetically. &quot;I hope it passes quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>The guesthouse door opened before the sergeant could reply. The children scrambled to their feet and stepped back as the tiger padded out into the sunlight. He wasn't as big as he'd been in Noxy's troubled dreams during the night, but she still had to stop herself from reaching for her mother's hand.</p>
<p>Almost unnoticed, his boy slipped out behind him and closed the door. Instead of his armor, he wore a plain brown rain cape over his kilt and boots. He kept his eyes downcast as the tiger said, &quot;Good morning, mayor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, respected,&quot; Indy replied. &quot;I trust you slept well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, I did.&quot; The tiger seemed not to notice that thirty pairs of eyes were staring at him. <em>He must be used to it,</em> Noxy thought.</p>
<p>Indy waited a moment to see if he would say anything more. When he didn't, she smiled and said, &quot;My daughter has asked if you could spare your boy for an hour so that she could show him our village while the other children do their chores.&quot; Noxy heard Rash mutter something at that. &quot;If he would like to---oh dear.&quot; She stopped mid-sentence as the sergeant took a deep breath and scrunched up his face. &quot;Nope,&quot; he whooshed a moment later, blinking. &quot;That one's not ripe yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd be better in bed than tramping around the countryside, sergeant,&quot; Kulbinder rumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree,&quot; said Indy firmly. &quot;My mother will make you some lemon ginger tea. That will set you right in no time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thang you,&quot; the sergeant said stuffily. &quot;Respected, will you---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to explore the forest,&quot; the tiger declared. &quot;I would rather we were not...surprised...as we were at the ford.&quot; And with no more ceremony than that, the tiger stood, stretched, and padded off toward the main gate.</p>
<p>Indy clapped her hands. &quot;Right. Everyone else, time for chores.&quot; As the children groaned and got to their feet, the tiger's boy finally raised his eyes to look at Noxy.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; he said, stepping down to the cobblestones and bowing ever so slightly. &quot;My name is Thokmay. I'm pleased to meet you.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy stuck out her hand. &quot;Hi. I'm Probably Noxious, but call me Noxy---everyone does.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy hesitated for a heartbeat, then took her hand in a grip much stronger than Noxy had expected. She was just as surprised to feel the calluses on his hands. He released her hand and gestured toward the gate. &quot;After you.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy and the tiger's boy walked side by side. &quot;That's the South Tower,&quot; said Noxy, pointing at six rectangular stories of stone. &quot;It still has a roof, but the stairs inside fell down a long time ago. You used to be able to get up there by climbing a tree, but they cut it down after Grappa Gas fell out of it for the second time. That was before I was born. And that one's the Round Tower, and the short one over there is called the Quick Tower, because it's quickest to get up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a shame they've been allowed to go to ruin,&quot; said Thokmay. &quot;Princess Shudarga's engineers work year round to keep the walls of Panday Castle sturdy. Perhaps when the war is over she could send some here to fix them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be nice,&quot; Noxy replied vaguely. She wondered how Grappa Gas would feel about having rebel engineers clambering around the village's wall. &quot;Oh, and that's Granna Fee's house, with the moss green door. She's my grandmother. And she teaches school. And that's Grappa Gas's house, the lavender one. He used to be mayor. And that's, um, well, they're all just different people's houses.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy fell silent. Thokmay had a polite but absent look on his face, just like the one Indy got when Grappa Gas started talking about how things had been in his day. <em>It's probably not much compared to a real castle,</em> she thought glumly. Two-story houses with steep shingled roofs, little vegetable gardens nestled between logs laid parallel a stride apart, and all around, sharp mountain peaks looming over the ancient gray walls... She wouldn't have believed how strange it all seemed to the young lowlander beside her.</p>
<p>They walked in silence along the path that ran next to the walls. Ancient cobblestones showed through the hard-packed dirt in a few places. Noxy scuffed crusts of frost off a few absentmindedly, wondering what else she could say.</p>
<p>Suddenly Thokmay stopped. &quot;What is that?&quot; he asked. A heavy wooden grill lay across a shoulder-high opening in the wall ahead of them. Behind it, rough stone steps led down into the mountain.</p>
<p>&quot;That's just some old tunnels,&quot; said Noxy. &quot;We're not supposed to go in.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay scowled. &quot;Sergeant Dorbu will want to know about them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; Noxy asked. &quot;Most of them are flooded. Except for the one under Grappa Gas's house, and the ones by the drying sheds. We use them for cellars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Soldiers should know as much as they can about their surroundings,&quot; Thokmay said, as if repeating a lesson to a slow learner.</p>
<p>Noxy bit back a sharp retort. &quot;Come on,&quot; she said, hurrying ahead. &quot;We can see more from up top.&quot;</p>
<p>The steps lay flush against the side of the wall. They had been built for the Pilot Angels, not for human beings, so each one was as high as Noxy's knee, and so broad that it took her two strides to cross.</p>
<p>Noxy put her left hand on the wall to steady herself each time she thrust herself up a stair. Even after hundreds of years, the stones fit together so snugly that it was hard to tell where one ended and the next began. She noticed smugly that Thokmay was puffing and sweating after only a few steps.</p>
<p>The top of the wall was wide enough for three soldiers to march side by side. The parapet along its outer edge was interrupted here and there by slits for lookouts and archers. &quot;Makes Your Breath Rancid is that way,&quot; Noxy said, pointing. &quot;You can't see it because the valley bends, but sometimes you can see their clouds coming out of their pen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you call your villages things like that?&quot; the young soldier asked.</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. &quot;They're called dragon names. They're supposed to make things sound unappetizing, so that when the dragons finally fly, they'll think twice about eating us.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay snorted. &quot;That seems pretty far-fetched.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, where does <em>your</em> name come from??&quot; Noxy bristled.</p>
<p>&quot;From the army orphanage,&quot; he replied, not looking at her. &quot;I had another name before I went there, but they gave me a new one.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth, then closed it. For once, she had no idea what to say.</p>
<p>As she was trying to think of something, Thokmay leaned through one of the slits in the parapet and pointed into the gorge below them. &quot;Are those the clouds we were on?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy glanced through the neighboring slit. &quot;Yup. The bull is Big Blue, and the cow is Pillow. We've had them forever---they're practically tame.&quot;</p>
<p>The two old clouds were hardly moving, but Noxy could have watched them for hours. She loved the way they slowly changed shape as they drifted about, and how soft they felt when she stroked them. Being up in the sky on a cloud was like riding on a grownup's shoulders when you were little, only a thousand times better. You could see everything---deer grazing beneath the twisted pines, mountain goofs standing on rocky ledges no wider than the heel of your boot, broad-winged condors making slow circles as they waited for a rabbit to forget to look up... When the air was still, and the cloud was just drifting, it felt like the whole world was a story that was about to be told for the very first time.</p>
<p>Thokmay stepped back and wrinkled his nose. &quot;They smell like wet sheep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's because they haven't rained for a while,&quot; Noxy explained defensively. &quot;Rash and I will probably take them out tomorrow and let them rain over the fish pond. Here, come with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Descending the stairs was even harder on her knees than climbing them. Rather than cutting directly through the village, she led Thokmay on a roundabout path through the vegetable plots around its edges. She'd seen the looks Sensy and Rash had given her when her mother had sent them off to do chores while she showed their youngest visitor around, and she wasn't keen to bump into them until they'd had a chance to cool off.</p>
<p>Once through the gate, she up the trail to the cloud pen. Big Blue and Pillow were both floating fifty strides away in the middle of the gorge. The bull was almost at their height, while the cow drifted further down in his shadow.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you call them over?&quot; Thokmay asked.</p>
<p>Noxy shook her head. &quot;You have to be touching them to mind-speak with them. That's what the ropes and cradle seat are for---see? If they're not close enough to the edge, someone has to be reeled out above them so they can jump on from there. It's pretty dangerous,&quot; she added airily.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; Thokmay said. He wrinkled his nose. &quot;But I still think they smell like wet sheep.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy bit back an angry retort. They didn't smell anything <em>like</em> sheep, not really, and if he wasn't smart enough to---</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em> &quot;Ouch,&quot; she muttered, putting her hand on the back of her head. The pain was strong enough this time that she thought there would be a lump, but she couldn't feel anything.</p>
<p>&quot;Is everything all right?&quot; Thokmay asked, eyeing her.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it's fine,&quot; she snapped. She closed her eyes. She had hoped the clouds would be right next to the mounting platform so that he could stroke one. Or even get on, though she knew what her mother would say about <em>that</em> if she found out. Like a thousand cloudherds before her, she wished the clouds would come when she whistled like the goofs did.</p>
<p>&quot;Um... Are they supposed to be doing that?&quot; She opened her eyes at Thokmay's words to see Big Blue turning toward them. Below him, Pillow was rising as quickly as Noxy had ever seen her move.</p>
<p>Thokmay stepped back instinctively as Big Blue bumped against the mounting platform. Noxy stroked the old bull's flank. &quot;See?&quot; she said. &quot;You can pull bits of them this way and that, but it all settles back into a big lump after a while.&quot; She grabbed a handful of Big Blue's side and pulled as hard as she could. When she let go, the bit she had teased out slowly sank back into the cloud.</p>
<p>The young soldier patted the cloud gingerly. Noxy grinned wickedly. &quot;Here, do this.&quot; She backed up, then ran at the cloud and threw herself up onto his back. <em>Poof!</em> &quot;Come on!&quot; she said when Thokmay hesitated. &quot;He won't bite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Noxious Aftertaste! What do you think you're doing?&quot; Noxy's heart leaped into her throat. There, at the top of the steps that led down to the platform, stood her mother and Sergeant Dorbu. &quot;You get off that cloud <em>right now</em>, young lady!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's stomach was churning by the time they reached the fortress gate. Her mother hadn't said a word to her on the walk back. &quot;Thank you for the tour,&quot; Thokmay said politely, putting out his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;You're welcome,&quot; Noxy mumbled. She shook his hand and then waited for the storm she knew was coming.</p>
<p>&quot;And thank you as well,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu told Indy, smiling. &quot;It was a pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're welcome,&quot; the mayor said. If she had been anyone but Noxy's mother, Noxy would have said she was blushing slightly.</p>
<p>As the sergeant walked away with Thokmay beside him, Indy rounded on her daughter. &quot;Tell me,&quot; she said coldly, &quot;What exactly would you have done if he'd slipped off the cloud?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He wouldn't have slipped off!&quot; Noxy protested. &quot;It was Big Blue---he's as safe as---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't care if it was Big Blue or the mattress on your bed!&quot; Indy said angrily. She didn't seem to care that half a dozen people were listening just a few strides away. &quot;Do you know what the soldiers are doing this afternoon? Do you? They're settling all their friends who died before we could get to them. What do you think they'd say if we had to tell them there was one more to settle, just because you wanted to show off?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, mayor,&quot; Noxy said wretchedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you 'yes, mayor' me. Now, Eyesie gave us some thimbleberries for those old boots you'd outgrown. I want you to get the seeds out so that I can make a pie for dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thimbleberries?&quot; Noxy said in despair. &quot;That'll take forever! Rash and Sensy and I were going to---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you should have thought of that, shouldn't you?&quot; Indy took Noxy by the shoulders, wondering yet again when her daughter had grown so tall. &quot;Daffodil, listen to me. <em>Really</em> listen to me.&quot; She combed her daughter's hair off her forehead with her fingers. &quot;Half the village is already muttering about it being time for a new mayor. How can I ask them to behave when my own daughter won't? Now, go get washed up and start on those thimbleberries.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded glumly. &quot;Yes, <em>amma</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>She moped home to collect the bucket full of hard red thimbleberries and a large bowl, then climbed the steps to the top of the Quick Tower. She and Sensy had covered a tumbled-down block of stone with a bit of gray canvas to make a pretend cloud the year before. Plopping herself down on it, she started squeezing bitter grain-sized seeds out of the thimbleberries one by one. Why did she have to be the one to show him around? Why couldn't the stupid soldiers have washed up somewhere else? And why did the sun have to be so...so sunny?</p>
<p>When she heard the first shouts from the main square she ignored them, thinking that it was just children playing jump-sticks or <em>kabbadi</em>. Then she heard Sergeant Dorbu shout, &quot;Hah! Heeeyah!&quot; She tossed another berry into the bowl and stood up on her stone seat to look.</p>
<p>She was just in time to see Thokmay duck under the sergeant's out-thrust sword and lunge with his own blade as he straightened up, shouting &quot;Hah!&quot; in turn. Every child in the village was gathered around watching, and not a few of the adults as well.</p>
<p>The sergeant knocked Thokmay's blade away and spun around, slashing left and right, one, two, three, as if he was fighting an invisible opponent. While his back was turned the young soldier stepped forward and stabbed the sergeant in the ribs.</p>
<p>The sergeant groaned, pinning Thokmay's sword with his arm so that it was pulled out of the boy's grip as Dorbu turned. Thokmay only had time to open his mouth before the sergeant's sword tapped him lightly in the chest. To Noxy's disgust, the children started to clap.</p>
<p>&quot;You must keep your grip even after you strike,&quot; Kulbinder grumbled. &quot;No point giving your man one last blow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Thokmay, panting slightly. &quot;I forgot.&quot; The sergeant handed his sword back to him. both his blade and the sergeant's were wrapped in leather so that they wouldn't cut. They were smaller than Noxy had imagined: each was only as long as its owner's arm, and no thicker than a pottery plate.</p>
<p>Thokmay and the sergeant brought their swords up slowly, touched blades with one another, and started fighting again. Thokmay lost quickly this time, but won the third round when the sergeant pretended to stumble over a loose cobblestone.</p>
<p>They practiced for almost half an hour. While the children clapped and cheered, some of the older villagers shook their heads and swapped disapproving looks. Still, they kept watching.</p>
<p>By the time the sergeant and his young opponent stopped, they were both soaked with sweat. They saluted each other one last time. &quot;You're getting better every day,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu said. &quot;But we could both use a wash-up.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay nodded, still breathing hard. &quot;Smells like we could both use one too,&quot; he said. For the first time, Noxy saw him smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Show me, show me!&quot; shouted Little Gas. He clapped his hands with excitement. &quot;I want to play!&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay's smile froze. He glanced at the sergeant, who shook his head almost imperceptibly. &quot;I'm glad you liked it,&quot; the young soldier said to Little Gas. His clear voice carried right across the village square. &quot;But it's not really a game.&quot;</p>
<p>He squatted so that he was no taller than Little Gas. &quot;But I can show you something else if you like,&quot; he said. He looked left then right, as if to make sure no spies or grownups were listening.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you have any spare socks at home?&quot; he asked. Little Gas nodded. &quot;Good. You go and get me three pairs of socks, quick as you can, and three stones the size of your thumb.&quot;</p>
<p>Little Gas bit his lip. &quot;I only have just one other pair of socks,&quot; he said. &quot;They're for when it's winter, so my feet will fit in my boots.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay's mouth opened, and closed, and opened again. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;Do you think your mother would let you borrow some? Just for a little bit?&quot; Little Gas nodded quickly and scurried away.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want the rest of us to get some socks, too?&quot; Sensy asked hopefully. She and Rash had been standing with the younger children, their chores either done or conveniently forgotten.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Sensy!&quot; Noxy said under her breath.</p>
<p>&quot;If you like,&quot; Thokmay said, straightening up. Sensy spun around and sprinted away. A handful of other children ran off as well.</p>
<p>Little Gas came puffing back a moment later. In his hands he had one pair of green socks, one pair of gray, and one pair with red and white stripes on them. &quot;Will these do?&quot; he asked, fishing some stones out of his pocket.</p>
<p>&quot;They look fine,&quot; said Thokmay. &quot;Now, give me your stones... Good. Now, the first thing we do is we roll up the socks like this, with a stone in the middle, to make a ball. See? And then the next pair... And the next... Now, are you ready?&quot; Little Gas nodded.</p>
<p>Thokmay stepped back, took a deep breath, and threw the balled-up socks into the air. His hands darted back and forth like hummingbirds. Somehow, he managed to catch each sock ball before it fell to the ground, and then throw it again in time to catch the next one. He caught them overhand, he caught them underhand, he threw two with his left hand while bouncing the third with his right, and then he threw them all in the air at once and caught them, one, two, three.</p>
<p>There was a moment of stunned silence. &quot;That's magic!&quot; Rash said accusingly. &quot;You're doing magic!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not magic,&quot; Grappa Gas laughed, looking as delighted as any of the children. &quot;It's called 'juggling'! I saw it in Chaghan once, years ago. It's just a trick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; Thokmay agreed, &quot;It's just a trick. Here, I'll prove it. Sergeant?&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu took the brightly colored sock balls and tossed them in the air, one, two, three. He whistled a happy little tune as he juggled, and even managed to wink at Sensy (who blushed). By the time he was finished, Little Gas was laughing and clapping his hands. &quot;Let me, let me!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;I want to!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, but you have to let me show you how,&quot; Thokmay said. &quot;You have to start with just two, like this. Um, Sergeant? Could you show the older children how it's done? Thank you. Now, put this one in this hand, and this one in the other, and...&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy watched Little Gas drop all three pairs of socks, pick them up, and drop them again. The little boy laughed. Seething, she sat back down on her pretend cloud and glared at the bowl of thimbleberries. It was going to be a long day...</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-swimming">Chapter 5: Swimming</h2>
<p>Noxy was still on her make-believe cloud an hour later, squeezing seeds out of thimbleberries so angrily it was amazing the the bucket didn't take fright and try to run away. Sensy pretended not to notice as she plopped herself down beside her friend. &quot;You should have tried it!&quot; she burbled. &quot;I only got them all up a few times, but it was so much fun! Rash could do it almost right away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure it was wonderful,&quot; Noxy grumbled.</p>
<p>Sensy pouted. &quot;Don't be such a goof.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not being a goof! I just think he was showing off. What did Rash think about him putting his arms around you like that?&quot; The last time Noxy had looked at the juggling, Thokmay had been standing right behind Sensy, reaching around to hold her arms just below the elbows.</p>
<p>Sensy brushed her hair back over her ear and grinned. &quot;Why should I care what Rash thinks?&quot; she asked sweetly. Her grin turned into a leer. &quot;Or maybe you're the one who cares?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, <em>I</em> think it was embarrassing,&quot; Noxy said primly. &quot;You were all following him around like ducklings, just because he knew a stupid trick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, at least he didn't make everyone say please nine times, like you did when I wanted to play with the whirlidoodle Granna Fee got you for your nameday last year!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's mouth fell open. Sensy had never talked back to her before!</p>
<p>The same thought must have occurred to Sensy. She looked down at the bucket by Noxy's feet. &quot;Wow, you've got a lot done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not enough. Here.&quot; She nudged the bucket with her foot. &quot;If you want to gossip, you might as well help.&quot;</p>
<p>Sensy brushed her hair back over her ear. &quot;I wasn't gossiping! I just came up to tell you that we're going to teach him how to play Snakes and Whistles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Snakes and Whistles? He must know how to play that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nuh uh. We were talking about it while we were juggling, and he said he'd never even heard of it. I guess they play different games down below.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess,&quot; Noxy echoed dubiously. She pursed her lips, then stood up abruptly. &quot;Well? What are we waiting for? Let's go show him.&quot;</p>
<p>By unspoken agreement, Noxy and Sensy didn't go through the main square---there was no point drawing anyone's attention to the fact that Noxy had set her chores aside. Instead, they picked their way through the stakes and strings in the village pepper garden, held their breaths as they snuck past the tannery, and slipped out of the fortress gate as quietly as shadows.</p>
<p>They reached the clearing where the other children had gathered just as Rash finished explaining the rules to Thokmay. &quot;But if you can run all the way back without getting whistled again, then you're safe,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that's everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's out of bounds?&quot; someone asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The heather bush, the ponderosa, the lizard rock, and that pile of earcones,&quot; Rash said, pointing at each landmark in turn.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you tell him about not making two snakes at once?&quot; Noxy asked.</p>
<p>Everyone groaned. &quot;Oh, we're not going to play like that, are we?&quot; Sensy pouted. &quot;It takes forever! Anyway, who's going to be leads?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You do one team with Thokmay,&quot; Noxy said immediately. &quot;Rash can be with me. Everyone else, pick a side!&quot;</p>
<p>The first game only lasted a few minutes. Thokmay ran straight for the middle of the field and was whistled almost at once. Noxy whistled Sensy a moment later while she was trying to explain what had happened. After that, her team couldn't get more than two or three children into a snake before being whistled by someone from Noxy's team.</p>
<p>Then Noxy and her team were the snakes, and the tables were turned. Thokmay swooped down on people like a hawk on a rabbit. He whistled three children in as many breaths, then doubled back and whistled Noxy before she finished saying, &quot;Hey!&quot;</p>
<p>They played until only Rash and Thokmay were left. Rash feinted left, then tried to run right, but Thokmay matched him step for step. The other children cheered him on, shouting, &quot;Back up! Come on, Rash! Make a hoop!&quot; but he just couldn't find an opening.</p>
<p>Rash feinted left again, hesitated for half a heartbeat as if to go right, then carried on to the left. Thokmay stumbled and went down on one knee. Rash raced past him, then stopped, walked back, and stuck out his hand to help him up. Everybody cheered---everybody except Noxy.</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like a tie,&quot; Rash said, grinning.</p>
<p>&quot;A tie?&quot; Noxy exclaimed. &quot;There's no such thing as a tie!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is now,&quot; Rash replied. &quot;You're not the only one who gets to make up rules, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, she's right,&quot; Thokmay panted. &quot;I'm beaten, fair and square.&quot; He picked up a nearby stick, saluted, and handed it to Rash.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm surrendering,&quot; he explained. &quot;Now you break my sword over your knee and hand me back the hilt.&quot;</p>
<p>Rash snapped the branch, then hesitated. &quot;Which end is the hilt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't really matter,&quot; Thokmay told him. Rash gave him the shorter piece of the stick. The young soldier accepted it gravely and tucked it into his belt. As he did so, Noxy saw him catch Rash's eye and wink. Rash winked back, as if sharing a joke. Noxy could have punched them both.</p>
<p>&quot;What happens if he doesn't accept your surrender?&quot; Sensy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;He has to,&quot; Thokmay assured her. &quot;Nobody would serve under someone who didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who said anything about serving under you?&quot; Noxy asked petulantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh Noxy!&quot; &quot;That's not what he said!&quot; She flushed as the others rounded on her.</p>
<p>Thokmay looked up at the sun. &quot;I should get back. Thank you all for the game.&quot; He bowed at the village children's answering chorus of thanks and then walked away, the broken stick still in his hand. After exchanging glances, Sensy and Rash followed him. As the rest of the children followed them, a sinking feeling in the pit of Noxy's stomach told her that maybe the young soldier actually had won the game---just not the game she'd thought they were playing.</p>
<p>Indy and Grappa Gas were by the gate when Noxy got back, deep in conversation with Sergeant Dorbu. The tiger was there as well, sitting on his haunches, with Thokmay at his side. Not for the first time, Noxy wished there was some other way into Stale that didn't involve jumping off a low-flying cloud.</p>
<p>&quot;But respected, I promise they'll stay out of everyone's way,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu was saying.</p>
<p>Indy shook her head. &quot;Letting you and yours stay here to heal up is one thing,&quot; she said apologetically. &quot;But if your men start walking patrols, it'll look an awful lot like we're joining this fight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing wrong with that,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered, subsiding when Indy shot him a warning look.</p>
<p>Kulbinder cleared his throat. &quot;May I suggest a compromise? What if some of the men were to ride with you when you take the clouds up? Sure no one could object to you giving them tours?&quot; He flicked an ear. &quot;I'm sure my boy for one would enjoy it.&quot;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Noxy was up in the Quick Tower on her make-believe cloud, her thimbleberries at her feet and her mother's pointed reminder still stinging in her ears. <em>It's just not fair,</em> she thought angrily. <em>I have to sit here doing chores, but <strong>he</strong> gets to go riding.</em></p>
<p>She tossed the berries she had picked up back into the bucket and clambered up to look over the parapet. Pillow was just leaving the cloud pen with Grappa Gas and Thokmay on her back. Noxy could almost hear Grappa Gas saying, &quot;There's nothing in the world as comfortable as an old cloud,&quot; just like he always did when he took <em>her</em> for a ride. At least he hadn't brought some maple twists to share with Thokmay---at least, she <em>hoped</em> he hadn't.</p>
<p><em>He'll let Pillow rain on the fish pond first,</em> she thought, <em>That way, she won't be fidgety.</em></p>
<p>Sure enough, Grappa Gas brought the cloud around in a graceful turn toward the fishpond. She didn't need any more instruction than that. She drifted to a stop, then started to rain contentedly. The pair of elders sitting on log benches beside the pond returned Grappa Gas's wave.</p>
<p>Noxy closed her eyes. She could practically mind-hear the old cow's contentment as she slowly began to lighten. <em>Why don't you just drop him in the pond?</em> she thought despondently.</p>
<p><em>Bad,</em> she imagined Pillow replying. <em>Bad hurt.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, he'd be all right,</em> she replied in her head. <em>The pond's pretty deep. And it'd serve him right for showing off with all his juggling and his surrendering and stuff.</em> She imagined Pillow thinning out underneath Thokmay little by little. He wouldn't notice right away, not on his second-ever flight with Grappa Gas talking a gallop a breath beside him.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes in shock. There, a hundred strides below her, she saw Thokmay sink slightly, then some more. He yelped as he suddenly realized what was happening.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; Grappa Gas shouted, reaching for him, but it was too late. Thokmay cried out as he fell through the hole in the cloud and splashed into the ice-cold fishpond.</p>
<p>His head burst above water a moment later. &quot;Help!&quot; he screamed. &quot;Help me! I can't---&quot; He thrashed his arms as if he was trying to swim, but something was pulling him down.</p>
<p>Noxy's hand flew to her mouth. His armor! Thokmay must have put his armor back on! She watched in horror as Grappa Gas shouted at the elders to get help. With two quick steps he reached the edge of the cloud and jumped.</p>
<p>A moment later he surfaced in the pond, spluttering and shouting, &quot;I've got you, lad!&quot; The old man wrapped one arm around Thokmay and began to backstroke toward the edge of the pond with the other.</p>
<p>Noxy pelted down the stairs, shouting that they'd fallen in the pond, both of them, they were going to freeze! Like everyone who had grown up in the mountains, she knew how relentless the cold was. Even if Grappa Gas got Thokmay out of the water, it could still---</p>
<p>The tiger surged past her. &quot;Canaries on me!&quot; he roared. Stalers leaped out of his way with startled shouts as he charged across the square and through the gate.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas and Thokmay had been hauled out of the pond and wrapped in goofskin coats by the time Noxy got there, but were shivering uncontrollably. &quot;How did this happen?&quot; Kulbinder demanded for the tenth time. &quot;How could he fall?&quot;</p>
<p>Aft shouldered through the gathering crowd with a pair of round jugs in his hands. Handing one to Granna Fee, he twisted the lid off the other and knelt beside the pond to fill it with water, then screwed the lid back on.</p>
<p>&quot;You just had to show off, didn't you?&quot; he growled at his father. Without waiting for a reply, he unscrewed the lid and passed the jug to his father. &quot;Drink up.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas pushed the now-steaming water aside weakly. &quot;G-g-give it to th-th-the boy,&quot; he stuttered.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll take care of the boy,&quot; Granna Fee said. She tipped her jug so that Thokmay could take a sip. &quot;There you go. Nice and slow. That'll warm you up from the inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Th-th-thank you, resp-p-pected.&quot; Thokmay reached for the jug</p>
<p>Granna Fee shook her head. &quot;I'll hold onto it for now,&quot; she said, kindly but firmly. &quot;Ulfmaerr only made the two of them, and if you knew what this old goof eats, I don't think you'd want to share with him.&quot;</p>
<p>It was another ten minutes before Thokmay and Grappa Gas could stand. They hobbled up the path toward Stale side by side with a crowd of villagers and soldiers around them. As they left the pond, Kulbinder cut Indy off. &quot;How could this happen?&quot; His ears were flat against his head, and his eyes glinted dangerously. &quot;He could have died!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They both could have,&quot; the mayor replied steadily. She matched the tiger's stare until the big cat blinked and looked away.</p>
<p>&quot;I apologize,&quot; he rumbled. &quot;But that doesn't change my question. I thought these clouds were safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are.&quot; Noxy heard the worry in her mother's voice. &quot;We've been riding them forever---Big Blue was Grappa Gas's first ride, and Pillow's not much younger. They've never done anything like this.&quot;</p>
<p>Standing unnoticed two paces behind her mother, Noxy felt as shaky as Grappa Gas and Thokmay. She knew why Pillow had dropped Thokmay in the pond, but she also knew that it was impossible to mind-speak to a cloud without touching it. The only problem was, she had felt herself do it.</p>
<p>She waited with everyone else by the trading hall until Granna Fee came out. &quot;He'll be all right,&quot; she reassured her granddaughter. &quot;We got the hot water into him before the cold could take root.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, <em>amma</em>.&quot; Noxy fell into step beside her grandmother. &quot;Do you think---I mean, I heard people talking. Do you think someone could have made Pillow drop him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Who said that?&quot; Granna Fee asked sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Noxy hedged, not meeting her grandmother's eyes. &quot;I just---I know Grappa Gas wouldn't have done it, and he was the only 'herd on her, and people can't mind-talk to clouds if they're not on them---can they?&quot;</p>
<p>Her grandmother stopped abruptly and put her hand on Noxy's arm. &quot;Why don't we go have a cup of tea?&quot; she said quietly. &quot;We can talk then.&quot;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later they were sitting at the tiny table in Granna Fee's two-room house, waiting for the kettle to boil. &quot;I wish we could have just used one of the magic jugs,&quot; Noxy joked weakly.</p>
<p>Granna Fee smiled. &quot;Me too. But it'll take them a couple of days at least to soak up enough heat to work again.&quot; She spooned some tea into her chipped brown pot, peered at it, and added another spoonful. &quot;I asked your father if he could make another one, but he said that part of him was all used up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did he say what part?&quot; Noxy asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>Her grandmother shook her head. &quot;I didn't ask. Here, I'll get that.&quot; She took the whistling kettle off the stove and slowly poured the steaming water into the teapot. Setting the kettle on a polished whorl of ironbark, she winked at Noxy and reached into her knitting basket to pull out a small jar and opened it. &quot;Honey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought you were out?&quot; Noxy said, taking it.</p>
<p>&quot;Only when Gas comes over. That man...&quot; She shook her head in mock despair.</p>
<p>They sipped their tea and put their cups down in unison, as they had countless times since Indy had become mayor and Noxy had started spending more time with her granna than with her mother. &quot;So what <em>do</em> you think happened?&quot; Noxy asked, hoping Granna Fee couldn't hear her heart thumping.</p>
<p>The old woman shook her head. &quot;I don't know. Your father---&quot; She stopped herself. &quot;Do you know how he discovered he could do magic?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. &quot;<em>Amma</em> never said.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee settled back in her chair with a wince, warming her hands with her teacup. &quot;He was fishing one day---not in a pond like here, but with a net in the ocean, back where he grew up---and he wished that he was done for the day. A heartbeat later the net fell apart in his hands and...&quot; She shrugged. &quot;No net, no fishing. But when he got back to land and tried to tie up his boat, he couldn't make a knot. Every time he tried, he'd drop the end of the rope or it would tangle in his fingers or something else would happen. Something had heard his wish and taken it as a bargain.&quot;</p>
<p>She leaned forward. &quot;He was lucky. There was another magician in the town where he grew up who could teach him how to control it. But he still wound up making some bad bargains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like having to live where nobody had ever slept on the sea,&quot; Noxy said.</p>
<p>Granna Fee nodded. &quot;Like that. It saved someone from shipwreck, he said, but he was half-crazy by the time he got here. Even down in Duck Droppings there was someone who'd been on a ship once, so he couldn't stay there more than a couple of nights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what does this have to do with Pillow?&quot; Noxy asked.</p>
<p>Granna Fee shrugged again. &quot;What if it wasn't Pillow? What if someone here can do magic, but doesn't realize it yet?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy took another sip of tea. Her mouth suddenly felt dry. &quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; her grandmother admitted. &quot;It might not even be one of us. I heard a couple of the soldiers talking in the trading hall last night, and some of them are pretty angry at the tiger for not spotting the ambush that got their friends killed. Maybe one of them... I don't know. It's all so tangled up, half the king's army on one side and the rest with the princess. Who knows how many wound up on the wrong side?&quot;</p>
<p>They talked about other things after that, normal everyday things like when it would be time to shear the goofs of their winter wool and how Sensy only seemed to want to talk about her hair and her clothes and who they might meet that summer and how many dishes Grappa Gas would wash for a taste of honey. It felt warm and comfortable, and was almost enough to convince Noxy that her grandmother might be right---that what had happened earlier that day had nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>&quot;I should go,&quot; Noxy finally said, eyeing her empty teacup regretfully. &quot;If I don't get those thimbleberries done, <em>amma</em> will shear <em>me</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee smiled. &quot;How about you bring them down here and we'll do them together?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, <em>amma</em>, but I said I'd do it.&quot; She stood, then impulsively stepped around the table to give her grandmother a hug. &quot;I love you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you too, daffodil.&quot; They held each other for a moment, one wondering when the other had gotten so big, the other wondering when the first had gotten so small, and then Noxy left.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6-the-coming-storm">Chapter 6: The Coming Storm</h2>
<p>Afternoon was flirting with evening by the time Aft returned on Pillow. &quot;She was huddled up in the canyon above Tinker's Creek,&quot; he told Indy, his face set in an even deeper scowl than usual. &quot;She was skittish like I've never seen her. Managed to spook a whole graze of wildings, too. One poke and it'll turn into a stampede.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy nodded. Aft had found her up on the wall, where she had come to check on Noxy's progress. The two adults were looking west, where sheets of cirrus were gathering above the peaks. &quot;Then let's hope nothing pokes them,&quot; she said after a moment. &quot;Although the way this day's gone...&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy kept her eyes on her thimbleberries. She had learned a long time ago that if she didn't draw attention to herself, adults would sometimes forget that she could hear them. She had learned a lot about cloudherding and negotiating with traders that way, along with a few things about her mother's youthful misadventures that she was definitely not supposed to know.</p>
<p>After a few more details about the wild clouds he'd seen and a barbed comment about whether there was anything his father wouldn't do to impress people, Aft nodded a goodbye and left. &quot;Finish those later,&quot; Indy told Noxy, her eyes still on the gathering clouds. &quot;We have other chores right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Stale was no stranger to storms. When bulls battled each other in the dead of winter, the snow fell so thick and so fast that people had to string ropes between the houses to find their way. And in the summer, when nimbus clouds that had stayed in the north to give birth flew south to rejoin their herds, the sky could darken in the time it took to sing a nursery rhyme. When that happened, the villagers knew it was time to tie their shutters closed and get the goofs indoors, because the rain was going to come down in sheets instead of drops.</p>
<p>&quot;I am from Thind,&quot; Kulbinder growled when Indy told him why she wanted the soldiers to stay in the trading hall. &quot;I have lived through monsoons. This could not possibly be worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe not, but I bet it'll be a lot colder,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu said. He and his men had spent the afternoon washing the bodies of their fallen comrades and patching the holes and tears in their uniforms. Those who were well enough had scoured the woods for firewood as well, stacking it to make a pyre just down the hill from the fortress gate. Indy and Noxy had found him there, helping as best he could while three of the village elders laid a spiderweb net over the wood so that it wouldn't blow away.</p>
<p>Kulbinder sniffed. &quot;Storm or not, someone should be on patrol. But I agree, it would be best if the men stayed warm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How---how is Thokmay doing?&quot; Noxy asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>The tiger looked at her for a moment before replying. &quot;He is well,&quot; he said. &quot;He is strong, and Respected Gas got to him quickly. He will be well.&quot;</p>
<p>The sun had almost disappeared behind the mountains when the first sharp line of lightning sparked the far-off clouds. Granna Fee said a word Noxy wasn't supposed to know. &quot;Let's not dawdle,&quot; she said briskly, pulling another armload of damp laundry off a drying line and stuffing it in a sack. Ten strides away, Little Gas was pulling apart strips of cedar bark so that Sensy could lay them along the irrigation trenches in the vegetable garden. Children, grandparents, and everyone else who could walk hurried to ready the village, stepping around soldiers or shooing them out of the way as they watched the sudden flurry of activity with bemusement.</p>
<p>Noxy carried the last sack of laundry upstairs to her bedroom for want of anywhere else to put it. Her mother was chopping onions by the time she got back downstairs. &quot;Thanks, daffodil,&quot; she said, blinking away a tear. &quot;Can you do some potatoes? And see if the cheese is still fit to eat. I hope the tiger isn't too picky.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy pulled up short. &quot;The tiger?&quot;</p>
<p>Indy sniffled. &quot;Yes, he's coming for dinner. So is the sergeant. His boy's still in bed.&quot; She swept a double handful of diced onions into the cooking pot with the back of the knife and started peeling what was probably the last knob of ginger in Stale. &quot;It's the polite thing to do,&quot; she continued without looking as Noxy opened and then closed her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, <em>amma</em>.&quot; Noxy set the loosely-woven bag of potatoes on the potato and began to scrub the skins off them with a piece of sandstone. She had almost decided to tell her mother what had really happened that morning, but that wasn't a discussion she wanted to start now---not the way her mother got whenever company was coming.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu knocked on their door just as the rain began to fall. Noxy had been expecting him to be in his uniform, but he had traded in his helmet for a plain goofskin cap that any cloudherd might have worn, and had left his sword behind.</p>
<p>Kulbinder padded in behind him while he and Indy were saying their hellos. He flowed up onto the chair across from Noxy and watched impassively as she swept the last scraps of potato off the table. &quot;He is better,&quot; the tiger said abruptly.</p>
<p>Noxy jumped slightly. &quot;Oh. You mean Thokmay? Um, I'm glad to hear it. It's pretty dangerous, getting dunked in frozen water like that. It happened to one of the goofs a couple of years ago. She got out of their pen and tried to get across the---um. It doesn't matter. But I'm glad he's all right.&quot; She could feel her cheeks burning under the tiger's cool stare.</p>
<p>Her cheeks heated up even more when she saw Sergeant Dorbu's grin. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; he said cheerfully. &quot;He does that to everyone. Saints, I almost swallowed my fork the first time I met him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a spoon,&quot; Kulbinder corrected. &quot;And it was more than 'almost'.&quot;</p>
<p>And just like that the rhythm of the meal took shape. Sergeant Dorbu had a seemingly inexhaustible supply of stories about his foolishness, clumsiness, or bad choices. Indy asked just enough questions to keep the stories coming, while Kulbinder's dry comments provoked protests of innocence and occasional snorts of laughter. As she table a tray bearing grilled slabs of cheese, fried onions, and boiled potatoes, Noxy realized with a start that she was actually enjoying herself. The mood was only slightly dampened by the tiger sniffing at the cheese and then saying thank you, but it would probably upset his digestion, he would hunt in the forest after the storm was over.</p>
<p>Conversation became more serious after the dishes were cleared. The Angry Canaries had declared for Princess Shudarga almost as soon as she raised her banner, and had been fighting ever since. &quot;Or getting to a fight, or getting away from one, or trying to get enough food in our bellies to keep us fighting,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu added. &quot;We were up north, with the Cut Cards under Colonel Ordshe, right in the middle of Shudarga's land.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that why you chose her side?&quot; Indy asked as she splashed some dark mountain <em>rak</em> into a glass and passed it to him. Catching Noxy's eye, she poured a thimbleworth into another glass and handed it to her daughter. The pungent fumes tingled in Noxy's nose as she tasted it gingerly.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu shook his head. &quot;Wasn't for that. My family...&quot; He paused, rolling his glass between his hands as if to warm them. &quot;We used to have land. Not much---really just a big farm with a couple of tenants to work it---but it was enough to keep us. Then one of our neighbors decided he wanted it. She honeyed up the local <em>tralpa</em>, promised him a slice of the takings, and...&quot; He spread his hands. &quot;By the time we got to court, she'd rented all the laws that would have saved us. We had a week to clear out after living their all our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That must have been horrible,&quot; Indy said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&quot;It is foolishness,&quot; Kulbinder rumbled. &quot;The law in Thind is not something to be borrowed for money like a bullock. There are rules for each station, and that is that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But then how does the king raise money?&quot; Noxy asked.</p>
<p>Kulbinder blinked slowly. &quot;The emperor takes what he needs when he needs it. It is...simpler.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simpler <em>and</em> fairer,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu added with a quiet intensity that hadn't been there a moment earlier. &quot;And that's what the princess wants. Laws should be there for everyone, all the time, not just for whoever has the most money on the day of a trial. And if that means a bunch of royals have to work for a living instead of renting out laws some king gave their great-great-grands way back when, that's fine by me.&quot; He drained his glass in one quick gulp. When her mother did the same, Noxy held her breath and swallowed the last of her own <em>rak</em>.</p>
<p>The thick black liquid felt like fiery smoke as it went down her throat. She clenched her jaw, but a strangled cough managed to escape. &quot;And that's enough for <em>you</em> tonight,&quot; her mother said in mock-disapproval.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, <em>amma</em>,&quot; Noxy said, gasping for air.</p>
<p>&quot;Here.&quot; Her mother pushed the empty kettle across the table. &quot;How about you refill that and I'll make tea? It sounds like the worst of the storm has passed, and a bit of air will help you clear your head.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded, not trusting herself to speak. She slipped her feet into her boots without bothering to do up the laces, pulled a poncho over her head, and stumbled out into the night.</p>
<p>Rain was still falling, but Indy had been right---most of the panicked clouds had passed, and the few stragglers chasing them were already east of Stale, heading toward the plains. She watched them for a moment, then closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Goof,&quot; she muttered a moment later. Of <em>course</em> she hadn't been able to mind-hear anything. What had happened earlier with Thokmay had been a coincidence. She shouldn't---</p>
<p>Something clattered in the narrow jitty between her house and the yarning shed. Noxy opened her mouth to ask who was there, but stopped herself. What if the troll had come back? There was no reason it would, but there was no reason it would have been in the village in the first place.</p>
<p>She set the kettle down quietly on the front step of her house and tiptoed gingerly toward the jitty. Holding her breath, she leaned forward and peeked around the corner, just in time to see a shadowy figure disappear out the other end. It was definitely a person, not a troll, but who would be out in the rain?</p>
<p><em>The soldiers,</em> she realized. It had to be one of the soldiers, except why would they be out in the rain either? Suspicious, she hurried to follow.</p>
<p>&quot;Ow!&quot; Ten steps in, her foot connected with a pile of cobblestones that she and Sensy had put there as part of some long-forgotten game. The stones clattered as they tumbled over. Cursing under her breath, she stepped over them, wishing that she had taken a moment earlier to do up her laces. Some of the broken cobbles had sharp edges, and if she lost a boot now, she'd never catch up.</p>
<p>She reached the other end of the jitty just in time to see the shadowy figure disappear around the edge of the tannery. She hesitated for only a moment before sprinting after it, her boots splashing in shallow puddles of rainwater. Whoever she was chasing was bound to hear her---the only question was whether she could catch them first.</p>
<p>She rounded the corner of the tanning shed a moment later. Her quarry was nowhere to be seen. &quot;Rot,&quot; she cursed. Left toward the trading hall, straight on toward the square, or right toward the vegetable patches and the gate?</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em> She shrieked with surprise as a bolt of lightning split the sky, then stomped her foot, angry at herself, the rain, and the world in general. She'd lost them. And by the time she got back, her mother was sure to give her the &quot;what took you so long?&quot; look that she hated so much.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em> Another bolt of lightning left a dazzling scar on the night. That one had been close, she realized uneasily---too close. The lightnings must be nipping at the clouds that had fallen behind their herd. She was suddenly glad that she wasn't airborne. She had only ever been on one night flight, when Granna Fee took her up on her nameday when she turned ten to show her a passing star.</p>
<p><em>CRACK! BOOM!</em> Noxy shrieked as the third bolt of lightning struck the weatherduck spinning madly next to the fortress gate and shattered its wooden pole. Splinters flew in all directions to clatter off roofs and cobblestones.</p>
<p>One smoking scrap bounced off a chimney and clattered through a window whose shutter had been left untied. As Noxy blinked to clear the after-dazzle of the lightning strike from her eyes, the sheets of dried moss that the wood had landed in began to smolder.</p>
<p>A door banged open. &quot;Saints!&quot; Aft hurried over to Noxy. &quot;Are you all right? What in the name of all that rots are you doing out in this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Amma</em> wanted me to fill the kettle,&quot; Noxy said stupidly. She shook her head. &quot;It---the lightning it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can see the lightning hit it,&quot; Aft said testily. He took her by the shoulders and peered into her eyes, then relaxed slightly. &quot;You'll be all right. Just a bit of a scare. Come on, let's get you back to---wait.&quot; He sniffed. &quot;What's burning?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy grabbed his arm and pointed. &quot;There! Upstairs!&quot; A bright lick of flame was suddenly dancing in a window. Another joined it as the familiar herby smell of burning moss caught in Noxy's nostrils.</p>
<p>&quot;Get your mother!&quot; Aft ordered, then cupped his hands around his mouth. &quot;Fire! Fire! Fire!&quot;</p>
<p>The village was lucky. That's what everyone told themselves half an hour later. They were lucky that the rain had made everything so wet, that there had been so little of the autumn moss left to burn, that Aft had spotted the fire so quickly. They were lucky the soldiers had been there to fill and pass buckets---with most of the adults gone, well, the elders and children would have done the best they could, but things could have been a lot worse.</p>
<p>&quot;But what were you doing <em>there</em>?&quot; Indy demanded as she and her daughter walked home arm in arm. &quot;You were just supposed to refill the kettle!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I saw something, like a troll.&quot; Noxy shook her head. &quot;I didn't get a good look at it.&quot; Which wasn't exactly a lie, but was an uncomfortable distance from the truth. The hooded figure had definitely been a person, but a bit short for an adult. And as the soldiers had arrived to help with the fire, only one of them had been the height of the figure she had seen. But why would Thokmay have been out in the rain when he could have been at dinner? And what had he been doing in the jitty beside her house?</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7-discovered">Chapter 7: Discovered!</h2>
<p>Stale woke to the muffled stillness that only ever comes after storms and minor disasters. The air was still damp and chill, but the sky was so clear that the peaks around the village almost sparkled. A sharp-edged whiff of charred wood hung everywhere, sweetened slightly by the potpourri of the moss that the brief fire had consumed.</p>
<p>It was a day for dawdling: for taking a little longer than usual to get out of bed, for letting the kettle boil a few heartbeats longer than it needed to, for discussing the day's chores in a little more detail than absolutely necessary rather than getting up from breakfast to start doing them. No one wanted to hurry, not even the soldiers whose turn it was to patrol the road leading up to Stale and the paths through the forest behind it.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu spread his hands helplessly when Indy asked if the patrols were strictly necessary. &quot;Regulations,&quot; he said apologetically.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas nodded firmly. &quot;That's right. Have to stick to routine if you don't want people to go slack.&quot; Indy and Noxy had found the two of them in the square, sharing strong cups of tea and advice about how best to extend the fishpond (though Noxy suspected the sergeant had mostly been listening to that part).</p>
<p>A shutter clattered open above them. Noxy glanced up to see Aft glaring down at them, his own mug clenched in his hand. When he realized she had seen him, he scowled and disappeared from the window.</p>
<p>Indy followed her daughter's gaze. &quot;All right,&quot; she told the sergeant absently. &quot;If you think it's necessary.&quot; She put her hand on Noxy's shoulder. &quot;Why don't you round up Sensy and Rash and see if you can keep the littles busy this morning? We need to clean up the mess from last night, and they'd just be under foot.&quot;</p>
<p>By the time the soldiers and Kulbinder left twenty minutes later, Aft and Indy were working with a dozen elders to tear apart the ruined upper floor of the burned storage shed. Charred beams were knocked free by heavy hammers and set in a pile to have their nails pulled. In a moment of inspiration, Noxy had Rash and Sensy drag a few of the least-damaged timbers to the other side of the square and lay them out in a zig-zag pattern for the littles to walk along. Were they a tightrope? A secret path through a jungle? Or a bridge over a pit full of lava, and if you fell off, you'd be burned alive? The littles seemed to be happy to believe all three at once, and as far as Noxy was concerned, anything that kept them from interrupting her repeated yawns was fine.</p>
<p>It was shaping up to be a perfect morning until one of the soldiers who had gone on patrol came running through the gate with his sword in his hands and bellowed, &quot;At arms! At arms! They've found us!&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu dropped the beam he was manhandling and swung down from the upper story of the ruined shed. &quot;Soldier! Report!&quot; he snapped.</p>
<p>The soldier pulled up short and thumped his fist to his chest in salute. His left hand was still in bandages, and the stitches holding the gash on his check closed were crusty with scabs. &quot;Respected!&quot; he wheezed. &quot;They... they...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Catch your breath, soldier.&quot; Sergeant Dorbu wiped his hand clean on his kilt and put two fingers in his mouth to whistle. The shrill double tone made Noxy jump. One of the children who had been walking the zig-zag of beams stumbled, then started to cry because she had stepped in the lava and had to go back to the beginning. Sensy shushed her, eyes as wide as Noxy's as the soldiers who had stayed behind tumbled out of the trading hall door, some on crutches, others still pulling on clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;Respected!&quot; The soldier straightened up and saluted again. &quot;Royalist rangers, respected. Two of 'em, light packs, with forest bows and short swords. The tiger got 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alive?&quot; Sergeant Dorbu demanded.</p>
<p>The soldier nodded. &quot;Yes respected. Chased 'em into us, respected, just like we practiced.&quot; He gulped. &quot;But there was a bird with 'em, respected. A crow. It got away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rot,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu swore. &quot;Was it Gifted?&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier shook his head. &quot;Dunno, respected. Didn't hear it say anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy cut in. &quot;Sergeant, does this mean there's an army coming?&quot; The question sent Sensy's hands flying to her mouth. Before Noxy could say anything to comfort her, Rash put his arm over her shoulders and gave her a squeeze. On any other day, Noxy would have been shocked and said something sarcastic. Right then, her only thought was a slightly bewildered, <em>But I'm scared too.</em></p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu thought a moment before shaking his head. &quot;Not likely, mayor. Rangers usually stay a day or two out from regular soldiers. My bet is a regiment has settled in at the foot of the pass to hold it closed now that it's clear enough to get through.&quot; He scowled. &quot;But if these two don't report back---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;---someone's going to come looking for them,&quot; Indy finished bleakly.</p>
<p>The next few minutes were as rushed as the time before had been relaxed. Dorbu picked a dozen men by name and told them to get their gear on. He sent the rest back to bed---they could still barely walk, and if there <em>was</em> going to be a fight, he wanted them out of it. But no, he didn't think there'd be a fight---not today, anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;And tomorrow?&quot; Grappa Gas asked. &quot;What are we all supposed to while you lot are chopping each other to pieces in the square? No, I <em>won't</em> hush!&quot; he snapped at Indy as she opened her mouth. &quot;Having a laugh at the <em>tralpa</em> is one thing, but sheltering rebels, that's another, and if you think we won't be held to answer for it when the king's men show up---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It won't come to that,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu interrupted. &quot;I promise.&quot; He raised his voice. &quot;I spoke to the mayor last night. If the royalists show up in force, we'll either take our chances getting through the pass, or surrender. We won't put you in danger.&quot; He drew his knife and laid it across his palm. &quot;On my blood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No need for that,&quot; Indy said hastily. &quot;We're happy to just take your word. Aren't we?&quot; She shot a stern look at Grappa Gas.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; the old man grumbled. He looked at the handful of nails he'd accumulated and sighed. &quot;What a mess.&quot;</p>
<p>The patrol arrived back in Stale a few minutes later with its two prisoners, but without Kulbinder, who was combing the woods for other rangers. &quot;Or that damn bird,&quot; one of the soldiers said. &quot;I'm sorry, respected, I should have got an arrow off, but it was just so rotting quick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry about it,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu said, clapping him on the shoulder. &quot;Now, who do we have here?&quot;</p>
<p>The royalist soldiers wore the same kilts and armor as the rebels, but had red and blue bands on their cuffs. Glancing at the sergeant's sleeves, Noxy saw stitch marks where matching bands had been removed. Both men had weathered faces and close-trimmed beards, though the larger one's was going gray while the smaller's was still as black as his skin. Both wore the same expression of sullen resignation, and neither seemed inclined to answer the sergeant.</p>
<p>He waited a moment, then sighed. &quot;All right. Respected, is there a shed of some sort we could borrow? Something with a door that locks?&quot;</p>
<p>Indy blinked. &quot;I don't think any of our doors lock. Oh, except the sugar chests in the trading hall, to keep the children out, but they'd never fit in there. Grappa?&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas started to shake his head, then snapped his fingers. &quot;What about the tunnels? We could put them in there and nail some boards across to stop them running off.&quot; He gestured at the salvaged timber beside them.</p>
<p>&quot;Tunnels?&quot; Sergeant Dorbu asked. He turned to Indy. &quot;What tunnels?&quot;</p>
<p>In the end, he chose the same tunnel that Noxy had shown Thokmay the day before. As the two prisoners pried the old wooden grill off the entrance under the watchful eyes of the sergeant, half a dozen of his men, an equal number of villagers, and a gaggle of children, Noxy debated telling someone---her mother, Sergeant Dorbu, <em>someone</em>---that Thokmay had known the tunnel was there. Why hadn't he told the sergeant? And had it been him out in the rain last night, or the younger ranger? He was a head shorter than his partner---maybe, in the dark, she could have mistaken him for a boy?</p>
<p>The old wooden grill clattered to the ground. &quot;Right, in you go,&quot; Aft growled. He had been holding a spare piece of wood like a club while the prisoners worked, clearly not trusting them not to bolt or the rebel soldiers to stop them if they did.</p>
<p>The older ranger spoke for the first time. &quot;What about the necessaries?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll get you a bucket,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu. &quot;And something to eat.&quot; He cocked an eyebrow at Indy. &quot;And maybe a couple of blankets?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, respected---and will you want some feather pillows to go with them?&quot; she replied, but she smiled as she said it.</p>
<p>The two captured soldiers lifted a salvaged beam for Grappa Gas to nail into place. The older captive watched him bang the first couple of nails into place, then snorted and looked away. &quot;What?&quot; the cloudherd asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't say anything,&quot; the royalist muttered.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas put his hands on his hips. &quot;Well, you didn't say it pretty loudly. You mind speaking up?&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier shrugged. &quot;Just don't like seeing a job done poorly, is all,&quot; he said, his lowland accent turning 'seeing' to 'saying' and 'all' to 'ale'.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't like---it's just nailing, man!&quot; Grappa Gas blustered. Some of the villagers hid smiles, knowing how proud the old man was of his handiwork.</p>
<p>The soldier shrugged again. &quot;Don't mind me, I'm just here to hold the heavy stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmph!&quot; Grappa Gas placed the next nail and lined up the hammer with exaggerated care. As he swung it back, the soldier snorted again. The hammer came down squarely on Grappa Gas's thumb.</p>
<p>&quot;Ow! Rot and damnation, man!&quot; Grappa Gas stuck his thumb in his mouth, glaring at the soldier. &quot;That hurts!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave him be,&quot; the younger soldier said. &quot;Worse he does, the sooner as we're quit of here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, that's it.&quot; Grappa Gas strode forward and held out the hammer. &quot;You're so crafty, you show us how it's done.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier glanced at the hammer, then at Sergeant Dorbu, who spread his hands. &quot;As long as the job gets done,&quot; he said, struggling to keep a straight face. Some of the villagers weren't even struggling any more, and Aft was grinning outright at his father's embarrassment.</p>
<p>The soldier shrugged once more. &quot;Sure. Here, you take this.&quot; Grunting, the two men swapped places.</p>
<p>&quot;A little higher. Yup. That's it. Nope, in closer to the wall. Hold it.&quot; The soldier eyed the beam's position critically. &quot;Good enough.&quot;</p>
<p>And with no more warning than that he spun around and swung the hammer at Sergeant Dorbu's head. The sergeant barely flung his arm to block the blow. <em>Thud!</em> The hammer made an ugly meaty sound as it connected with his forearm.</p>
<p>At the same instant, the younger soldier flung his end of the beam at Aft. Aft jumped back with a curse so that the beam clattered to the ground at his feet instead of crushing his toes. &quot;Run!&quot; he shouted needlessly as the older soldier charged through the crowd.</p>
<p>Someone shrieked. Grappa Gas yelled, &quot;After him!&quot; and took two steps before stumbling and falling to his knees, having forgotten about his wooden leg for the first time in twenty years.</p>
<p>Two of the rebel soldiers were already running after the escaping prisoner. The younger one feinted left, then lunged right to go in the opposite direction. Without thinking, Noxy stuck out her foot. &quot;Oof!&quot; The soldier sprawled facelong on the ground. &quot;Owf!&quot; Aft landed on top of him.</p>
<p>The two scrabbled for a moment in the dirt before the soldier suddenly relaxed. &quot;I yield!&quot; he said. &quot;I yield, damn it! Get off me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like hell,&quot; Aft grunted, twisting the soldier's arm up behind his back. He got up on one knee, then rose to his feet without relaxing his grip. &quot;What do you want done with him?&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu was cradling the arm that had taken the hammer blow. His jaw was set and his eyes cold. &quot;Put him in the hole,&quot; he said curtly. &quot;You!&quot; He nodded at Noxy. &quot;Get to the gate. Tell whoever's there what's happened, but keep your distance, you hear? Don't try to stop him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Indy exclaimed. &quot;Wait! She's not a---&quot; But Noxy was already gone.</p>
<p>The escaped soldier had gone back the way they had come, through the village. The path at the base of the wall was longer, but Noxy knew it like her tongue knew her teeth. She vaulted over a crate someone had left out through the winter, skidded on a cobblestone that was still crusted with winter ice, dodged around Sensy's startled granna and grappa with a shout of, &quot;Look out, he's escaped!&quot;, and practically flew into the narrow jitty between their house and their neighbors.</p>
<p>Her boots splashed in a puddle left behind by the previous night's storm. As she burst out the other end, she plowed straight into Thokmay and knocked him off his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry!&quot; Noxy exclaimed, reaching down to help him back to his feet. &quot;Did you hear? One of the soldiers escaped! We've got to tell whoever's at the gate!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Thokmay gasped, waving her on as he tried to re-fill his lungs. &quot;I'll catch up.&quot;</p>
<p>That was all Noxy needed. She raced along the side of the trading hall and sprinted across the square to the gate. Three soldiers were standing there, two on their own feet and one on crutches. She quickly explained what had happened.</p>
<p>&quot;Hasn't come by here,&quot; the one on crutches said. He had a single yellow ribbon around his sleeve, and a thick bandage wrapped around his shin.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet,&quot; another added grimly, drawing his sword and hefting it in his hand. &quot;Best for him he doesn't, either.&quot;</p>
<p>Boots clomped on the cobblestones as Thokmay trotted up to join them. &quot;Is there any other way out?&quot; he asked Noxy.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &quot;Not unless he can fly.&quot; She hesitated. &quot;But if he finds some rope, and gets up onto the wall, he might be able to climb down.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay nodded. &quot;I'll find Kulbinder and warn him,&quot; he told the three soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll come with you,&quot; Noxy said hurriedly.</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; Thokmay told her. &quot;It's too dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy stared at him in disbelief. &quot;Too dangerous? I know the forest a lot better than you do!&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay patted the sword at his hip. &quot;And I know a lot more about fighting than you do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take her with you,&quot; the soldier on crutches ordered.</p>
<p>&quot;But---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's an order,&quot; the soldier said sternly, pointing at the ribbon around his sleeve.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes respected,&quot; Thokmay replied woodenly. Without looking at Noxy, he said, &quot;Lead the way.&quot;</p>
<p>The air was colder and damper in the forest gloom. Noxy rubbed her arms to warm them as she walked. Thokmay didn't seem to mind. <em>But he wouldn't with that thick coat on,</em> she thought sourly. It didn't look like it had gotten wet the night before, but if he'd been wearing a rain cape... And it would have had plenty of time to dry if he'd hung it up near one of the big fireplace stoves in the trading hall---their thick stone sides stayed warm all night.</p>
<p>Thokmay raised a hand. &quot;Hold.&quot; He pointed the forest floor in front of them. &quot;This must be where they fought. See where the branches are broken?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so,&quot; Noxy said, rubbing her arms more vigorously. Cloudherds learned how to read the sky almost before they learned how to read books, but woodcraft was mystery to her. Truth be told, she had never really liked being in the forest. The trees always seemed to loom over her. It wasn't too bad when the birds were singing, but when it was silent---</p>
<p>&quot;Why is it so quiet?&quot; she asked, suddenly realizing that she hadn't heard anything for the last hundred heartbeats except the soft pitter-pat of water dripping from the branches around them.</p>
<p>&quot;Sh...&quot; Thokmay made a cutting gesture with his hand. &quot;Something's watching us.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shivered. &quot;Is it the tiger?&quot; she whispered. She glanced over her shoulder. They were only a couple of hundred strides from the fortress gate, but it felt like home and sunlight and safety were a world away. The forest didn't want them there. It didn't want their voices or their boots or the short sword that was suddenly in Thokmay's hand.</p>
<p>She pressed the heels of her hands to her temples. What was happening? She couldn't be mind-hearing the forest---could she? She must be going crazy. It was too much---it couldn't all fit. Her head was going to burst.</p>
<p>&quot;It's too big...&quot; Noxy whimpered.</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Thokmay hissed urgently. &quot;Be quiet!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy put a hand on a nearby tree to steady herself. The bark was cold and damp but reassuringly solid. The little beads of sap under her palm were frozen nearly solid but still sticky. She took a deep, shaky breath. She wasn't going to throw up after all. &quot;I'm all right,&quot; she told Thokmay, smiling weakly. &quot;Just... just a headache.&quot; Somewhere nearby, a sapsucker chirped uncertainly. A squirrel chattered in response, and from right behind her, a tiger spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Kulbinder demanded. Noxy shrieked and spun around. The tiger ignored her. &quot;You should be in the village!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One of the prisoners escaped, respected. The older one. Took a hammer to the sergeant, but he'll be all right. He's probably still inside the walls, and Corporal Choegyal at the gate is watching for him.&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger growled. &quot;I've seen nothing. But you were foolish to come here.&quot; He glanced at Noxy. &quot;And doubly foolish to bring her.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth to protest that he hadn't brought her, she had volunteered. An all-too-familiar twinge in the back of her head stopped her. She looked up, but could only see a few tiny patches of blue. &quot;We should hurry,&quot; she told the others. There was a cloud coming---a big one---and it was moving fast.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8-royalty">Chapter 8: Royalty</h2>
<p>The first thing the soldiers at the gate told Kulbinder was that the escaped royalist was still missing, but hadn't come by them. The second was that Sergeant Dorbu's arm hadn't been broken, but it would be a while before he could swing a sword properly.</p>
<p>&quot;Remain here,&quot; Kulbinder ordered the soldiers. &quot;I will hunt for the prisoner. You.&quot; He twitched an ear at Thokmay. &quot;You have chores, do you not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, respected.&quot; Thokmay and the other soldiers saluted the tiger's hindquarters as he padded away.</p>
<p>As he disappeared around a corner, Noxy cleared her throat. &quot;Um, I'd better go see if my <em>amma</em> needs me.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay nodded. &quot;I hope you're feeling better.&quot; He saluted the other soldiers and headed for the trading hall.</p>
<p>Noxy made a beeline for the wall stairs. Once up on the parapet, she scanned the horizon. There! The cloud was still so small that she could have covered it with her thumb, but it was definitely headed toward Stale.</p>
<p>She found her mother by the tunnel entrance, watching while Grappa Gas hammered a beam into place. The younger prisoner sat inside on a blanket, spooning cold rice into his mouth from a bowl. Sergeant Dorbu and Aft were gone, but four extra soldiers stood with the two holding the beam in place.</p>
<p>Noxy put her hand on her mother's arm. &quot;<em>Amma</em>, there's a cloud coming. It'll be here soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy frowned. &quot;Who is it?&quot;</p>
<p>Her daughter shook her head. &quot;I don't know, but it's big. <em>Really</em> big.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mother shook her head despairingly. &quot;There's never just one raindrop, is there? All right. Go find Aft and your granna. And the sergeant too, if you can find him. He and his men are---oh!&quot; She jumped as Kulbinder landed on the ground beside her with a sound like a wet blanket falling on a floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Sergeant Dorbu is searching the tannery,&quot; the tiger said, his ears back and his tail bristling. &quot;The smell is truly disgusting. If the prisoner is in there, he is welcome to it. Now, what is this about raindrops?&quot;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, a small crowd stood on the mounting platform watching the cloud approach. Sergeant Dorbu and Kulbinder were front and center, but a trio of soldiers with bows had split off to take positions overlooking the canyon. When Indy and Grappa Gas protested, the sergeant cut them off. &quot;They won't do anything unless I tell them to,&quot; he said. &quot;And I won't tell them to unless it's absolutely necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since when do you get to decide what's necessary?&quot; Grappa Gas demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Since someone disappeared without a trace in a village the size of a bathtub,&quot; the sergeant shot back. Then he shook his head and said, &quot;I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.&quot;</p>
<p>The cloud descended as it approached. The soldiers on the platform loosened their swords in their scabbards. Grappa Gas rapped his knuckles against his wooden leg, three and two, three and two, until Indy quietly asked him to stop. Below them, Big Blue and Pillow stirred restlessly, pushing themselves from one side of the pen to the other as the strange cloud approached.</p>
<p>Noxy closed her eyes and tried to slow her thumping heart. After what had happened in the forest, she was scared to try to mind-talk at all, much less to a cloud she didn't know. She jumped a little when her mother gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; Indy said softly. &quot;Everything's going to be all right.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded. The cloud was about to disappear behind the spurs and ridges that rose above the pass. She closed her eyes again. That grumbling mind-mutter was Big Blue. And that---that must be Pillow. So the newcomer was...</p>
<p>Her eyes shot open as Aft cursed, &quot;Rot and ruin. It had to be him, didn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But who's he carrying?&quot; Grappa Gas, shading his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Who's 'he'?&quot; Sergeant Dorbu asked.</p>
<p>Aft's mouth twisted. &quot;His name's Tasteless. But you might as well just call him trouble, because he always is.&quot;</p>
<p>The cloud bumped against the mounting platform a minute later. &quot;Canaries---reeee... spect!&quot; Sergeant Dorbu bellowed in a parade ground voice. As one, the assembled soldiers thumped their fists to their chests in salute.</p>
<p>&quot;Why thank you!&quot; The bandy-legged man who hopped down from the cloud sketched a bow. &quot;It's nice to finally get the welcome I deserve.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not for you, you goof,&quot; Aft muttered.</p>
<p>The bandy-legged man's grin widened, but before he could answer, another man stepped onto the platform and returned Sergeant Dorbu's salute. His close-cropped hair was shot through with gray, and his face was as cold and as hard as the mountains around them. Where the sergeant had two ribbons sewn around his sleeve, the newcomer had three yellow braids. He returned the Angry Canaries' salute as half a dozen other soldiers' dismounted beside him, their boots drumming on the mounting platform. They all wore spotless uniforms, and all had the same stony look as their commander.</p>
<p>&quot;Sergeant,&quot; the newcomer snapped. &quot;I trust the archers we saw coming in are friendly?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, major.&quot;</p>
<p>The major nodded. &quot;Good. My men will be bringing them down.&quot; He glanced sideways. &quot;And the Gifted?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's with us too, respected.&quot; Sergeant Dorbu cleared his throat. &quot;May I asked, respected, what is---oh.&quot; The soldier blinked rapidly, then inhaled and bellowed, &quot;Canaries---reeee... spect!&quot; once again as Her Highness Princess Shudarga, formerly <em>tral-tralpa</em> of the six districts that made up the northern quarter of Gandan, now leader of the rebellion, slid down off the cloud onto the mounting platform.</p>
<p>She was not much taller than Noxy, stocky and broad-shouldered like a stonemason. The golden thread in embroidered collar of office around her neck gleamed against her dark skin. When she smiled, her teeth seemed as white as the snow-capped peaks around them.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this is a pleasant surprise,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;Major Bonzon, could you introduce us please?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My apologies, Your Highness. Sergeant?&quot;</p>
<p>It shouldn't have been possible for Sergeant Dorbu to straighten up any further, but somehow he managed it. &quot;Dorbu, respected, acting commander of fifth troop, second regiment of ordinary foot. This is my second and chief scout, the Gifted Kulbinder, and the respected Literally Indigestible, mayor of Stale Leftovers.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy bowed. The rest of the villagers followed suit---even Grappa Gas, though he hesitated one rebellious heartbeat before doing so.</p>
<p>The princess acknowledged their bows with a slight nod. &quot;And how, may I ask, did the second regiment's fifth troop wind up here? Aren't you supposed to be in Chaghan?&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu grimaced. &quot;About that, Your Highness...&quot;</p>
<p>The villagers might as well not have been there as Major Bonzon and the princess peppered Sergeant Dorbu with questions on the walk back to Stale. When he described the ambush, they asked about the makeup of the royalist forces. When he told them about being trapped by the forest, and about the cloudherds rescuing their wounded comrades, their questions were about the surviving men. How many were fit enough to march? How many would be if they had another day or two to rest?</p>
<p>And when he told them about the two royalist rangers they had captured, and that one of them was on the loose, she didn't even break stride. &quot;Major Bonzon will handle it, I'm sure,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>As short as the princess was, she moved briskly, and didn't seem fazed at all by the thin mountain air. Major Bonzon stayed beside her, his hand never far from the hilt of his sword, while the half-dozen soldiers that Noxy now realized were bodyguards kept pace ahead and behind. The villagers trailed behind like the tail of a comet, with Grappa Gas stumping along at the rear, cursing quietly under his breath as he tried to keep up. The cloudherd Tasteless kept to the back as well, either because he couldn't be bothered to rush, or because he was prudent enough to stay as far away from Aft as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, what about these trolls?&quot; the princess asked. &quot;How aggressive were they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're mostly not trouble at all, Your Highness,&quot; Aft broke in, all trace of his usual belligerence gone. &quot;Not so long as we keep to what's ours and don't disturb what's theirs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good,&quot; she said crisply. &quot;And the forest itself? How likely are we to be able to get troops through to Chaghan?&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu shook his head. &quot;Sorry, Your Highness. A few rangers might make it, but nothing more.&quot; She pursed her lips at that, but didn't reply.</p>
<p>The three archers Sergeant Dorbu had sent up the ridge were waiting at the fortress gate when they arrived, watched over by twice their number of the new arrivals. The archers had the sullen look of schoolchildren who have just been told their homework isn't good enough and will have to be redone. The princess's men had the same close-trimmed beards and leathered skin of the royalist rangers. They all saluted as the princess and her entourage approached.</p>
<p>&quot;Stand easy,&quot; she ordered. &quot;Mayor Indigestible, please let the major know where the men can quarter, and where you'd like me to stay. Major, I want a complete inventory in two hours---everything we still have, everything we're missing. And put out some patrols, not that I need to tell you your job.&quot; She yawned suddenly, then blinked as if she was as surprised by it as everyone else. &quot;And mayor, if there's any chance of a bath, I'd be eternally grateful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, Your Highness,&quot; Indy said. &quot;My daughter and her friends can lay one on for you right away. But---&quot; she hesitated. &quot;Forgive me asking, Your Highness, but what are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>Princess Shudarga looked at her bleakly. &quot;Running away. The rebellion is over. We lost, and the only thing we can do now is live to fight another day.&quot;</p>
<p>Stale's bath house was the second largest building in the village. One third was the men's sauna, which Noxy had only been in once, on a dare when she was eight. The other two thirds held half a dozen tubs lined with carefully-fitted sheets of slate. Each one had a small stove built into its side, topped with a boiler capable of holding eight large buckets of water. A squeaky pump at one end drew water from the long pipe that snaked through the village carrying snowmelt from the upper pond to the laundry sluices.</p>
<p>Or rather, that carried snowmelt in the warm months. Sensy worked the pump fruitlessly a few times before giving up. &quot;It must have frozen again,&quot; she told Noxy with a frown. &quot;But it was working a couple of days ago, and we've had rain since then, not snow.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. &quot;Maybe a bearfrog got stuck in it again.&quot; She nudged a nearby bucket half-heartedly with her boot. &quot;You stoke, I'll carry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You carried last time,&quot; Sensy pouted.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine, I'll stoke,&quot; Noxy sighed, grinning behind Sensy's back as the other girl picked up a pair of buckets. There was plenty of kindling in the box by the window---it was the first thing she had looked for when they entered---and she had always loved starting fires.</p>
<p>The grin slipped from her face as she laid a few dry twigs in a criss-cross pattern and tucked a few wisps of dry moss underneath them. If the rebellion was over, what was going to happen to rebel soldiers? And more importantly, what was happening to <em>her</em>? As much as she wanted to believe that what had happened in the forest had just been lightheadedness or the beginnings of a fever, she knew something more was going on. Was she becoming a magician like her father? Or was she simply going crazy? She needed to talk to someone, but who?</p>
<p>Something heavy thumped on the floor behind her. A hand clamped over her mouth as a strong arm wrapped around her, pinning her own arms to her sides. A low voice spoke in her ear, its owner's lowland accent rounding the long vowels. &quot;I'm not going to hurt you, young miss, but I'll need you to be keeping still.&quot; It was the escaped ranger!</p>
<p>&quot;Mmph!&quot; She struggled anyway, knowing it was hopeless---he was twice her weight, and as strong as he was lean. He stank of stale sweat, woodsmoke, and most of all of urine. He must have been hiding in the tanning shed, she realized, her thoughts strangely calm. It was the one place where Kulbinder wouldn't be able to smell him.</p>
<p>She bent forward and snapped her head back as hard as she could. There was a satisfying <em>crack!</em> the back of her skull connected with his jaw. &quot;Here now!&quot; he grunted, squeezing so tightly so that she could barely breathe. She didn't have to escape, she realized. She just had to hold on until Sensy got back. The ranger couldn't hold onto both of them at once.</p>
<p>The door opened. The ranger spun around with Noxy still in his arms, but it wasn't Sensy---it was Thokmay and Kulbinder.</p>
<p>The three humans froze, but not the tiger. He bounded forward at Noxy and the ranger with a roar. She shrieked as the soldier pushed her at the tiger and snatched up a stick of kindling. Kulbinder knocked her aside with his shoulder and pounced on the ranger. He shouted something unintelligible as he went down, his makeshift club bouncing off harmlessly off the tiger shoulder. There was an awful <em>crack!</em> as the back of his head hit the lip of one of the bathtubs, and then he was still.</p>
<p>&quot;Go fetch Sergeant Dorbu,&quot; Kulbinder snarled. &quot;<em>Now!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy didn't need to be told twice. She stumbled out the door and down the steps just in time to collide with Sensy.</p>
<p>&quot;Noxy, what's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The---he---in there,&quot; she gasped. &quot;Don't go in. The prisoner, he---the tiger---&quot; She suddenly realized she was crying. When had that started?</p>
<p>Sensy set her buckets down hastily, heedless of the water that sloshed out of them onto her boots. She took Noxy by the shoulders. &quot;Are you all right? What happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the soldier,&quot; Noxy explained, wiping her face on her sleeve. &quot;He was hiding, but then he grabbed me, and then the tiger came at him. We have to get my <em>amma</em>. And, and, the sergeant, and---&quot;</p>
<p>Sensy's eyes widened. &quot;Come on!&quot; She tugged Noxy's arm. Together, the two girls ran through the village.</p>
<p>It was like kicking a beehive. Noxy wasn't even a sentence into stammering out what had happened before Indy pulled her into a hug and Sergeant Dorbu and Major Bonzon were barking orders and running back to the bath house with the other soldiers right behind them with swords in their hands and Aft right there with them, yelling about the back door to the bath house, someone should go around back in case someone tried to escape that way. Other soldiers ran for the trading hall and Princess Shudarga, yelling at villagers to get out of their way.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, daffodil,&quot; Indy murmured, squeezing her daughter almost as hard as the ranger had. &quot;Oh, my beautiful girl, don't scare me like that.&quot; <em>It wasn't <strong>my</strong> fault,</em> Noxy thought petulantly. But she didn't say it. Instead, she just snuffled into her mother's coat and tried her best to lose herself in her mother's arms.</p>
<p>Dinner that night was very different from the one the night before. Indy, Granna Fee, and Grappa Gas put on their best clothes as if it was Ancestor's Day and they were all going to give thanks together. The villagers cleared the big table in the middle of the trading hall and laid it with the carved Thindi teak cutlery that Aft's great-granna had left the village as a memorial gift a century ago. People coated slabs of goof's milk cheese with whatever spices they could find and threw them into pans of marinade.</p>
<p>Noxy, Sensy, and Rash were pressed into service to round up children, run frantic errands, and finally as servers. Sensy and Noxy brushed the tangles out of each other's hair and swapped tunics with each other, then swapped them back. &quot;I don't know if I can do this,&quot; Sensy said, fighting back tears.</p>
<p>Noxy gave her a quick hug. &quot;I don't either. But look on the bright side---for once, we won't be stuck looking after the littles.&quot;</p>
<p>Six sat down to dinner, Indy and the two elders from the village and the princess, Major Bonzon, and Sergeant Dorbu in uniform. &quot;What's taking so long?&quot; Noxy muttered out of the corner of her mouth. They were standing with their backs against the wall next to the kitchen door, waiting awkwardly as Aft put finishing touches on the evening meal. He had put himself in charge of preparations as soon as the royalist soldier was safely nailed into the tunnel with his companion. Noxy had no idea what he was doing---like most women in the village, she was content to leave the cooking to the men---but the smell was making her stomach rumble.</p>
<p>At the table, Grappa Gas carefully poured his best black <em>rak</em> into small glasses and passed them to the village's guests. &quot;To your health,&quot; he said, raising his to toast them.</p>
<p>&quot;And to yours,&quot; Princess Shudarga said, raising hers in return. &quot;And to hospitality. Finding safe haven here was the first good thing to happen to us in quite some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So what happened, Your Highness?&quot; Grappa Gas asked, settling back in his chair. &quot;Last we heard before the sergeant here showed up, you and yours had the upper hand.&quot; From where she stood, Noxy could see the kick her mother aimed at his good leg even if the princess and the two soldiers couldn't, but Grappa Gas didn't flinch.</p>
<p>The princess didn't seem to mind his directness, though Major Bonzon's eyebrows gathered like a pair of bull clouds getting ready to fight. &quot;We did. The people understood what we were fighting for---we were humbled by their support. King Denpa's men understood as well, and more took up our banner every day. If we had pressed a little harder, moved a little faster...&quot; She shook her head, her thoughts far from Stale's one-story wooden trading hall.</p>
<p>&quot;You wanted to save lives, Your Highness,&quot; Major Bonzon said. &quot;There's no dishonor in that.&quot;</p>
<p>The corner of her mouth quirked up in a brief half-smile. &quot;Thank you, major, but I'm long past worrying about honor. Yes, I wanted to save lives. I wanted to give the king's men a chance to see that we weren't really fighting him, we were fighting rules that have us all in shackles, nobles and commoners alike. I wanted to give <em>him</em> a chance to see the justice of our cause and step aside.&quot; She sighed. &quot;But all I managed to do was give our neighbors time to realize that if the Gandani stood up, it wouldn't be long before their own people did too. Nyengmo, Trunggar, Lhabde... The only one that didn't send troops was Chaghan.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas nodded. &quot;So you're going into exile? With these as your honor guard?&quot; Noxy knew the look on his face. It was the careful lack of expression he wore whenever they were playing <em>shibo</em> and he had just seen a winning combination. She wondered if the princess knew where his sympathies lay, then kicked herself mentally. Of course she would---Sergeant Dorbu would have told her.</p>
<p>The princess smiled a proper smile this time. &quot;There's that word again, 'honor'.&quot; She set her <em>rak</em> down carefully. &quot;It's a a conjurer's trick, respected Gas, just like 'tradition'. Those with power made it up, then convinced everyone else it was real so that they wouldn't wonder why the rules always seemed to run against them. So no, these men aren't my honor guard. They are my companions, and my equals. They don't serve me---we serve a greater cause, together, and will do so until everyone in the Ninety Kingdoms has the law they deserve.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy suddenly realized she was holding her breath. Princess Shudarga hadn't raised her voice, but somehow she had filled the whole room as she spoke. Beside her, Aft stood transfixed, the first plate of grilled cheese and vegetables forgotten in his arms, his eyes as wide as a child's.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas cleared his throat. &quot;I see. But you <em>are</em> all going to Chaghan together?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are,&quot; Major Bonzon said, his own glass of <em>rak</em> untouched in front of him. &quot;Along with the rest of our men.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas leaned back in his chair. &quot;Really? How are you going to get them through the forest?&quot; He jerked his chin at Sergeant Dorbu. &quot;That didn't go so well last time.&quot;</p>
<p>Major Bonzon shook his head. &quot;We're not going to go through the forest. You and your fellow cloudherds going to fly us over it.&quot;</p>

*Shapers and Bots* is a role-playing game for children age 8 and older.
It is inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
countless stories of talking animals,
and my daughter.

Each game has one or more *players* and one *Director*.
Each player plays the role of one character,
while the Director plays all the other characters.
The Director can be an adult,
but children age 10 and older can also be Directors.

> These rules are derived from [Third Eye Games][third-eye]'
> [Pip System][pip-system].

## Background

Centuries ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals to create dozens of thinking species,
then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels:
half-human creatures with strange powers,
thinking machines that are now their own masters,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you play a young animal adventurer or a newly-awoken bot
in search of adventure.
You can be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and can travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds.

## Game Mechanics

Every character in *Shapers and Bots* is described by their *characteristics* and *skills*.
Everything a character might want to do,
like climb a wall,
has a *difficulty*.
Together,
the two determine the odds of the character doing what they want to do.

Characteristics and traits are expressed in how many dice the player gets to roll:

| Rating      | Number of Dice |
| ----------- | -------------: |
| Novice      |              1 |
| Hobbyist    |              2 |
| Competent   |              3 |
| Expert      |              4 |
| Outstanding |              5 |

Every difficulty also has a number of dice associated with it:

| Difficulty | Number of Dice |
| ---------- | -------------: |
| Simple     | 1              |
| Average    | 2              |
| Tough      | 3              |
| Amazing    | 4              |
| Legendary  | 5              |

When a character wants to do something,
her player rolls as many dice as her rating gives her.
Each 4, 5, or 6 counts as a success.
The Director then rolls the number of dice indicated by the difficulty
and adds up the number of successes.
They then compare scores:

| Outcome                               | Meaning                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Player's score is higher              | Success!                       |
| Player's score is higher by 3 or more | Epic success                   |
| Player's score is lower               | Failure                        |
| Player's score is lower by 3 or more  | Epic failure                   |
| Tie                                   | Success, but with complication |

> If you don't have enough dice, you can use coins:
> heads counts as a failure, and tails counts as success.

For example,
suppose that Shau Sheu is an Expert climber and is faced with a Tough wall.
She rolls 4 dice and gets 2, 3, 5, 6, for a total of 2 successes.
The Director rolls 3 dice and gets 1, 2, 4, for a total of 1 success,
so Shau Sheu has climbed the wall successfully.

Now suppose she needs to climb a slippery icefall.
The difficulty is Legendary,
so she needs a better score with 4 dice than the Director gets with 5 dice.
Once again, Shau Sheu gets 2 successes,
but all 5 of the Director's dice come up successes!
Since Shau Sheu has lost by 3 or more,
it is an epic failure:
she doesn't just fall,
but a whole section of the ice breaks away with her.

Later,
having survived the ice fall thanks to quick intervention by a flying bot,
Shau Sheu needs to climb another Tough wall.
Once again, she scores 2 successes.
The Director also scores 2 successes;
since the result is a tie,
Shau Sheu has succeeded,
but has dislodged a stone.
As it goes tumbling into the depths of the ravine,
the noise it makes alerts the guards above her.
Shau Sheu's day is about to get a little more interestingâ€¦

### Fluke

If a character has no rating at all,
they can still succeed by fluke.
The player rolls a single die:
if it is a 6,
it counts as a success,
and they get to roll again.
Their score is then the number of 6's they rolled in a row.
However,
a 1 at any point is automatically an epic failure.

For example,
Shau Sheu is trying desperately to open a mag-locked door
before the gas leaking into the room suffocates her.
She has no rating at all in lock-picking,
so she can only succeed by fluke.
She rolls a 6!
And another 6!
And then a 3,
giving her a total score of 2 successes.
The task is Tough,
so the director rolls 3 dice and gets 1 success.
The lock clicks open and Shau Sheu staggers out of the room, coughing.

## Characteristics and Skills

By default,
every character has an Average rating for these characteristics:

- **Size**: how large the character is.
  A character may have separate **Height** and **Weight** traits instead
  if that's a better way to describe the character.

- **Fitness**: how strong and coordinated the character is,
  i.e.,
  how athletic they are.

- **Dexterity**: how good the character is with their hands.
  This determines whether they can pick a lock or play a musical instrument.

- **Intellect**: how good the character is at book learning and abstract reasoning.
  A character with a low intellect is *not* stupid:
  they just don't like solving logic puzzles.

- **Sight**, **Hearing**, and **Smell**.
  Note that Smell includes the sense of taste.

If they're going to be an important part of the game,
extras (non-player characters) may have two more characteristics:

- **Courage**: how brave the character is.

- **Honesty**: how likely the character is to tell the truth.

Players' characters don't have scores for these
because being brave and telling the truth (or not) are part of the game.

Characters may also have ratings for these characteristics,
all of which are Novice level (1 die) by default:

- **Acting**: impersonating people, feigning illness, etc.
- **Awareness**: noticing little details (a good skill for a detective).
- **Charisma**: charming people (or intimidating them).
- **Crafts**: fixing clocks, knitting, and other handicrafts.
- **Fighting**: hand-to-hand combat.
- **Healing**: first aid and treating poisons and diseases.
- **Stealth**: the fine art of not being noticed.
- **Survival**: making a fire, knowing what's good to eat, etc.
- **Trivia**: general background knowledge.

## Species

| lion      |           | High      |           |      |           | High    | High  | carnivore          |

| zebra     |           |           |           |      |           |         |       |                    |

Player may raise one trait by one level when they create a character,
or two traits by one level each if they also *lower* one trait by one level.

*Example:
Larrapin is a 15-year-old rabbit.
Her player has raised her IQ from Average to High.*

| Trait     | Rating   |
| --------- | -------- |
| Size      | Very Low |
| Fitness   | Average  |
| Dexterity | Average  |
| IQ        | High     |
| Sight     | Average  |
| Hearing   | High     |
| Smell     | High     |

*Ynge is a turtle.
His player has raised his Size and Fitness,
but has lowered his sense of Smell in exchange.

| Trait     | Rating   |
| --------- | -------- |
| Size      | Average  |
| Fitness   | Average  |
| Dexterity | High     |
| IQ        | High     |
| Sight     | Very Low |
| Hearing   | Average  |
| Smell     | Low      |

## Skills

Every character has skills that they're particularly good at.
Some common skills are listed below
along with the trait or traits they are based on.
If a person doesn't have any special training,
their ability in that skill is equal to their level in that trait
(or the lower of their traits' levels if several are listed).
If the base trait is "--" it means that characters don't have any ability at all by default.

| Acrobatics (FI)         | Acting/Disguise (IQ)   | Animal Handling (IQ)    |
| Boating (--)            | Camouflage (--)        | Camping (FI)            |
| Climbing (FI)           | Craft ++ (--)          | Dancing (FI)            |
| Drawing (--)            | Driving (--)           | Escapology (--)         |
| Farming (--)            | Fighting (FI)          | Fine Art ++ (--)        |
| First Aid (--)          | Gambling (--)          | Hunting (FI)            |
| Hypnotism (--)          | Juggling (--)          | Lockpicking (--)        |
| Mechanics (DX)          | Medicine (--)          | Metalwork (--)          |
| Music (--)              | Navigation (--)        | Persuasion (IQ)         |
| Picking Pockets (--)    | Riding (FI)            | Robotics (--)           |
| Shooting (--)           | Singing (--)           | Skating (FI)            |
| Skiing (FI)             | Sneaking (FI)          | Stage Magic (DX)        |
| Swimming (--)           | Throwing (FI)          | Tracking (--)           |
| Trapping/Fishing (--)   | Tunnelling (--)        | Unarmed Combat (FI)     |
| Ventriloquism (--)      | Weapon ++ (FI)         |                         |

The skills marked with "++" are actually categories,
and each skill within the category must be learned separately:

- **Craft**: sewing, woodwork, baking, etc.
- **Fine Art**: sculpture, painting, etc.
- **Weapon**: sword, spear, pistol, etc.

Characters may also have knowledge of history, a language, mathematics, science,
or some other specialized field.
A character's knowledge of any field is initially zero,
and must all be learned.
The Director may allow players to choose skills for their characters
that are not on this list.

A player may give their character one of the following:

- 5 skills raised 1 level.
- 3 skills raised 1 level, 1 skill raised 2 levels.
- 2 skills raised 2 levels, 1 skill raised 1 level.
- 1 skill raised 3 levels, 2 skills raised 1 level.

When raising skills,
start counting at Low,
i.e.,
giving a character an Average rating for Singing counts as raising it 2 levels, not 3.

*Example:
Larrapin grew up in the mountains.
Her player decides to raise her Skiing by 2 levels from Average to Very High,
her Climbing by 2 levels from Average to Very High,
and her First Aid to Low.
(Remember,
when starting with no base ability,
Very Low doesn't count as a level.)*

*Example:
Suppose Larrapin is trying to escape a band of angry foxes.
The Director decides that ski-jumping over a ravine is Challenging (target 13).
Larrapin rolls two dice, gets a total of 5, adds 2 for her High ability,
and tumbles into the ravine!*

## Shaping

A small number of animal characters have psychic powers
that let them control the world with their mind.
This is called *shaping*,
and is almost always attuned to one aspect of reality.
Those who have one of these abilities typically start with a rating of Very Low,
which slowly improves with practice and training.
The six most common kinds of shaping are:

-  **Earth**: dirt and stone. Very experienced earth shapers can also shape metal.

-  **Air**: wind and sound.

-  **Light**: create (silent) illusions and make shadows.

-  **Water**: in its liquid form. Very experienced shapers can also shape ice.
   Water-shaping an animal is a very serious crime.

-  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.

-  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.
   (Nobody can stop or reverse time, or see the future.)

It is *extremely* rare for someone to be able to do more than one kind of shaping.

*Example:
Larrapin is an air shaper.
Before her grandfather passed away,
he taught her what little he knew,
so her score is now Low instead of Very Low.*

## Conflict

Sometimes adventurers are attacked and have to fight their way out of trouble.
Other times,
they have to talk their way past a suspicious guard.
Situations like this are called *conflicts*,
and instead of beating a fixed difficulty,
the player has to get a higher score than their opponent.

*Example:
Larrapin doesn't have any particular training in hand-to-hand fighting,
so her rating is Average.
She has just been tackled by an angry monkey whose rating is High.
Larrapin rolls two dice and gets a total of 8 (with no bonuses).
The zebra rolls two dice and gets 7,
but adds a bonus of 2 for a total of 9.
Larrapin goes down!*

## Bots

The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning floors to mining the ocean floor.
Since the Makers disappeared,
the bots have repaired themselves however they can to keep themselves going,
and made new bots whenever they can find the right materials.
The result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike.
One might have six short legs and a pair of mis-matched claws for arms,
while another might use two rotor fans to fly,
but have only a single slender manipulator to pick things up.

Bots have Size, Fitness, Coordination, and IQ scores just like animal characters.
Their Sight and Hearing scores are Average by default,
but only a few bots have any sense of smell or taste at all.
(Most regard smell as slightly icky,
and would prefer that living creatures didn't talk about it so much.)

## Example Characters

### Madica

Madica is a teenage fox.
She has worked on her parents' fishing boat every day since she was a child,
so she is quite healthy.
She has a keen nose,
and is also very good with her hands:
she's had a lot of practice tying knots and mending nets,
and her mother has taught her a bit of singing and stage magic.

| Trait     | Rating  | Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Size      | Low     | Boating      | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | Fishing      | Very High |
| Dexterity | High    | Swimming     | High      |
| IQ        | Average | Knots        | High      |
| Sight     | Average | Stage Magic  | Low       |
| Hearing   | Average | Singing      | High      |
| Smell     | High    | Quarterstaff | High      |

### Rhymes With Orange

Rhymes With Orange was built to clean windows on ultra-tall skyscrapers.
It has long spidery limbs with suction cups for climbing,
but a very small body.
It also has a storage tank built into its back that can hold up to 5 liters,
and has modified the water jets on its arms to squirt almost any kind of liquid.
Rhymes With Orange's battery was damaged years ago
in an accident that robbed it of most of its memories.
It can only go 3-4 days without being recharged by another bot,
so it is constantly doing odd jobs in exchange for power
or gambling to try to win a recharge.
(It only cheats when it has to.)

| Trait     | Rating  | Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Height    | High    | Climbing     | Extreme   |
| Weight    | Low     | Acrobatics   | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | Gambling     | Very High |
| Dexterity | Average | Squirting    | High      |
| IQ        | Average | Mathematics  | High      |
| Sight     | Average | Navigation   | High      |
| Hearing   | Low     |              |           |
| Smell     | None    |              |           |

## Plot

-   Bluster and Bravo caught trying to steal weapons from the bots
    -   Prosecutors come down hard on the bots rather than the thieves
    -   Shaper Leaf observes that the Prosecutors don't seem to mind that the breathers have weapons
    -   Shaper Blazes doesn't like being challenged
-   Dockety is the unofficial leader of the bots
    -   "Patient will return. Heck will return. We will defend ourselves. And you."
-   Explains that it saw Papa Roo working some ancient machines
    -   "Some will only work for the living, and not even for all of them"
    -   Find out later that there are genetic markers that only a few breathers have
-   Story ends with a message from deep space that the Makers are returning

## Ideas

-   tensions
    -   Rusty Bridge "breathers" fear their new bot neighbors
        -   Set up near the charging pillar a few minutes outside of town
        -   Helping with farmwork and fixing the road
        -   Zeke the bear grumbles the most, and doesn't take kindly to jokes that it's because he's no longer the strongest
    -   a whiff of BLM
        -   the Prosecutors are supposed to be impartial
        -   clearly biased toward breathers, even though some of them are bots themselves
    -   rescue Papa Roo
        -   it's hopeless...but maybe not with a luck shaper
    -   keeping Sindy's powers secret so she isn't "recruited" by the Prosecutors
        -   "You wouldn't be sleepin' rough like us. You'd be in the Governor's mansion makin' sure things went right."
        -   "What if I don't want to be?"
        -   Blazes' ears went back. "You didn't earn this gift, so it ain't rightly yours."
    -   romance between Maddy and Gumption
        -   inter-species romances are common among teens, but most folk settle down with their own kind
        -   Gumption's mother is a goat, but his father is a sheep
        -   Gets teased (bullied) for having mixed parentage
        -   "Doctors and donors and it's kind of personal so how about we don't talk about it?"
        -   Except Mama Roo brings it up as gently as she can with Maddy, who really (really) doesn't want to talk about it
-   Central and Shaper Blazes are mirror images of each other
    -   both believe the ends justify the means
-   the Prosecutors include a bot and a cyborg
    -   not just about protecting people from bots
    -   "There are plenty of bad squishies out there as well" says the bot (gets smacked for using the word)
-   Shaper Blazes sneers that other tortoises have served as Prosecutors
    -   turns out Shaper Leaf helped found the Prosecutors but left because he lost faith in what they were doing
-   Shaper Leaf sacrifices himself in the end to destroy Central
    -   tells Sindy it's good luck not bad: "always wanted... to be useful..."
-   the Makers return at the end in a great big ship

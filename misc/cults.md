# Enuk Manamee

### Mythos and History

**Before Time:**
In the Great Age before the Lesser Darkness,
a fire god named Enuk Manamee came to dwell among the people on the Norther shore of the Pale Sea.
His name meant "Tundra Summer",
and for the warmth he brought and the warmth he showed,
he was much loved by these folks.

Enuk Manamee stood aloof during the Lesser Darkness,
but with the coming of the Greater Darkness he gathered together his strength to defend his people.
When the armies of Ice approached from the south,
he stood before them,
daring them to pass or to harm those he cared for.

Pass they finally did,
leaving Enuk Manamee fallen and mortally wounded at the placed called Weeping.
It was thus that the remnants of his people found him.
Out of their grief and gratitude they forged the Oath---they would give their power,
themselves,
and anything else required to make Enuk Manamee whole again.

**Since Time:**
Enuk Manamee's weakness at Time's beginning left him freedom to change, but little else.
He could give no magic to shelter the Oath-sworn from the Darkness and Air,
or from the incursions of other people into the tundra.
Barely alive himself,
all he could do was teach skills of survival to those few of his guardians who did not perish from the cold.
Many tales are told of the hardships of those first winters,
and of heroes such as Anga who sacrificed themselves to save their bands of Oath-sworn.

Over time, Enuk Manamee grew more powerful,
obtaining the ability to supply his followers with magic.

**Life After Death:**
The Oath-sworn know that those who have kept the Oath will join with their god at Weeping after death,
returning to the Ever-Summer of Godtime.
Those of Lord or Priest status can expect to become guardian spirits,
ghosts bound to the protection of their god.
For the ones who break the Oath,
nothing but a cold, eternal darkness awaits.

Burial in the tundra is accomplished by covering over the dead cult member with a cairn of rocks.
Often several generations will be buried in the same cairn,
the pile of rock being extended and added to over the years.
These long, twisting mounds of stone serve as landmarks in the tundra,
and are often guarded by a ghost or ghosts.

**Runic Assocations:**
The primary rune of Enuk Manamee is the elemental rune Fire.
This is modified by the power rune of Statis,
representing the frozen form of the god.

## Nature of the Cult

**Reason for Continued Existence:**
The cult of Enuk Manamee provides the basics skills for survival in the tundra,
and provides the Oath-sworn with a reason to survive.
To a large extent,
the structure of the cult is the social structure of its member people.

**Social/Political Position and Power:**
Leaders of the bands of Oath-sworn,
who are invariably Rune Lords or Rune Priests of the cult,
serve also as teachers, advisors, and if need be, saviors.

**Particular Likes and Dislikes:**
Because of the interdependence of the Oath-sworn and Enuk Manamee,
anything capable of harming either one is disliked.
Chief among these is Ice;
any Oath-sworn must fight to destroy,
or at least drive off,
any Ice being found in the tundra.

Also disliked are Darkness,
for the cold of Winter,
and Storm/Air,
partially for tarditional reasons,
and partially because of the Storm season's destructiveness in the South.

Death is not liked by the cult,
and Death-associated deities have long returned the sentiment.
Although accepted as part of living,
Death is fought with any resource.

Other Fire cults,
with active gods,
are envied and emulated.
Ofte,
when out of their homelands,
members of this cult will join other Fire cults in the hope of learning new skills or spells.
Note that often the Oath-sworn have an almost pathological need to prove themselves as good as anyone whose god is whole...

Peaceful cults and cults of growing things are envied and cherished by the cult,
and no cult member will allow harm to come to a member of such a cult.
The majority of the women of Enuk Manamee's people are part of some Fertility-related cult.

Finally,
the other tundra people,
those not Oath-sworn are looked upon with disgust.
In the Winter hunts,
members of these tribes may be slain as Initiation sacrifices.

**Holy Days and High Holy Days:**
The longest day of summer is the High HOly Day.
Lesser holy days occur on each Sunday.

## Organization

**Inter-Cult Organization:**
Each band of Oath-sworn may be considered a separate faction of the cult.
Whenever two bands join,
the senior Lords and Priests will choose one of their own number to lead the new, larger band.
This is decided in a long session of bargaining, boasting, and contests.
The process continues from the Sacred Time to the Summer,
until all the Oath-sworn are assembled at the five Warm Places.

Whoever is senior Priest at Weeping then becomes the new High Priest.
In a day-long ceremony,
the last year's High Priest hands his successor a spear wiht a flint head,
an arrow fitted likewise,
an animal pelt,
and a burning torch;
all Rune Lords and Priests sacrifice one point of characteristic POW,
and the new High Priest is ordained.
He or she then chooses a Rune Lord to act as High Lord for the coming year.

After the summer gatherings,
the Oath-sworn once again break up into family-sized bands to survive the lean fall,
winter,
and storm seasons.

## Lay Membership

**Requirements to Become a Lay Member:**
Any child of the Oath-sworn who survives to puberty becomes a lay member of the cult
and begins participating in ceremonies.
The membership is mostly male,
but exceptional women have often been admitted.
For those not botn to the Oath-sworn,
lay membership may be given if the person has never been associated with Ice, Darkness, or Storm/Air,
and if he can pass a test abstracted as (POW + CON) divided by 2 times 5 on D100.
If the person has lived in the tundra for one winter,
or aided a cult member in distress,
or sacrificed to Enuk Manamee,
add half again to the chance of acceptance.
Only humans and elves may join.

**Intra-Temple Organization:**
The organization wtihin the bands is much the same as that without.
The Lord or Priest who can best brag and bargain will become the leader of the group.
In return for following his orders,
the members of his band (from twenty to a hundred individuals)
are given instruction in the cult and other skills and spells.
The only notable exception to this,
the Long Spears,
is discussed below.

**Centers of Power and Holy Places:**
Th hot springs at Weeping constitute the only holy place of the cult.
The year's High Priest and Lord stay there wiht a picked retinue of guards to defend the god for the year.
The other four hot springs,
places where Enuk Manamee's blood flowed,
are centers of worship and ceremony,
but are not holy.
No one shelters at any of these latter four places during the cold seasons
out of fear of draining them before Enuk Manamee's recovery.

**Requirements to Remain a Lay Member:**
Lay members of the cult are expected to act for the good of Enuk Manamee and the Oath-sworn
and to learn to survive int he tundra.
They must sacrifice 1 point of Battle Magic POW each Sunday at sunrise.
Like anyone in the cult,
lay Oath-sworn are expected to share half of everything hundred or found.
Additionally,
once each Winter they must give something which they have made to a Lord or Priest of their band.
This gift commemorates the gift of the Oath-sworn to Enuk Manamee,
and a great deal of pride and craftsmanship goes into it.

The lay membership of the band must obey their elders and superiors.
They must wear something red at all times,
except when hunting.
Like all band members,
they must work for the good of the band.

**Mundane Benefits:**
The primary enefit of cult membership is survival.
A single man could only survive alone in the tundra with a great deal of experience, luck, or both.
Being part of the Oath-sworn ensures assistance when it is needed.
Cult members take pride in the fact that no Oath-sworn has ever started without his whole band starving as well.

### Skills

Not only are cult members allowed to learn the following skills,
it is demanded of them.
Any cult member who does not take advantage of the one or two hours of free instruction per day is ridiculed
and expelled from the band.

Skills taught by the band are:

- Bow
- Camouflage
- Hide in Cover
- Starsight
- Oratory
- Shield (small or medium)
- Spear (any size, any mode)
- Snow Survival
- Tracking

#### Starsight

- Knowledge skill
- Base 0%
- 400/800/1600/3200

This skill pertains to the use of the stars for navigation---a very important skill for sailing and navigation in the tundra.
In the featureless snow,
it is essential to the band's survival.

#### Snow Survival

- Knowledge skill
- Base 10%
- 300/600/900/EXP

The tundra is not as benign an environment as most of the world.
To reflect this,
a person alone or without equipment in the cold seasons must make this roll once per day
or take 1D3-1 damage in each limb from frostbite.

Other skills are often available from Lords or Priests who were Long Spears in their youth.
This varies widely from band to band.

### Spells

As with skills,
spells will be taught free to any working member of the band.
As with more fire-related deities,
Enuk Manameespecializes in magic related to that run.

- Reduced: Detect Enemies, Firearrow, Fireblade, Ignite
- Double cost: Detect Gems, Detect Silver, Xenohealing (lakc of opportunity to practice)
- Prohibited: Bludgeon, Darkwall, Detect Undead (the "undead" nature of Enuk Manamee interferes), Estinguish, Silence.
  Bladesharp may be learned, but not cult member will teach it.
- Unique: Firespear, Heat.

#### Firespear

- Cost to cast: 3 POW
- Range: touch
- Focused, Passive
- Free to working lay members
- Duration: Instantaneous

This spell is cast upon a spear as it is thrown.
That spear is turned into a lance of flame,
doing 3D6 damage if it hits.
This spell is basically the same as the Firearrow spell.

#### Heat

- Cost to cast: Variable
- Range: 40 meters
- Unfocused, Passive, Temporal
- Free to working lay members
- Duration: 15 minutes
- Up to 4 points

For each point of the spell,
one human-sized thing (SIZ 21 or less) may be raised in temperature by 5 degrees C for 15 minutes.
If cast upon an inanimate object, that object is heated;
if cast upon something animate,
it warms the immediate surrounds to blanket the thing with a layer of personal warmth.
Nothing of lead and nothing of Ice may be so heated.
Something of gold requires twice the usual POW.

## Initiate Membership

### Becoming an Initiate

To become an Initiate of the cult of Enuk Manamee,
a person must be at least 60% at Snow Survival
and have shown dedication to the cause of the Oath-sworn.
The person must also have spent at least one winter as a lay member,
and must know at least one point of the cult spell Heat.

Some time during the person's last winter as a lay Oath-sworn,
he must leave his band and spend one entire week alone.
During this time,
a sizable animal of the snows must be single-handedly hunted and killed.
The skin, teeth, or claws of this animal are given to the band chief upon return,
and the person is initiated the following summer.
The new Initiates,
in a day-long ceremony,
swear the Oath
and each is given a small ornament of gol.

### Remaining an Initiate

The requirements for remaining an initiate are much the same as those for a lay member.
Two points of Battle Magic POW must be sacrificed each Sunday,
and the Initiate must continue studying the various sills.

Most Initiates return to their family bands,
and some join a new one.
Some,
however,
will choose to join with others of their age to follow a particularly adventurous Lord or Priest instead.
Such people and bands are called the "Long Spears",
both from the two-handed spear which is their favored weapon,
and from their habit of making deep,
sometimes year-long forays out of the tundra.

The cult encourages this practice,
which arose during the First Age when magic could only be learned outside the tundra.
Non-cult magic and skills are often learned during these ventures,
and many future band leaders gain experience this way.
Without exception,
the High Priests have been past Long Spears leaders.

### Mundane Benefits

In addition to continued instruction in the cult skills,
and the chance to go adventuring,
Initiates are given authority within the band.
They have more personal freedom than lay Oath-sworn;
they may marry,
trade with non-Oath-sworn,
and leave their band.

### Skills

The same skills are available to the Initiates as to lay members.
However,
if an Initiate seeks training in a skill not available in his home bnd,
he has freedom to search out an outside teacher.

### Magic

Initiates have the same Battle Magic spells available as lay members.
In addition,
they may sacrifice characteristic POW for the special cult spell Suspend Animation.
They are also allowed (by Enuk Manamee, at least) to learn magic from any other non-hostile cult.
Whether the other cults will accept them or not is a different question.

## Rune Lord Membership

### General Statement

The Rune Lord of Enuk Manamee are leaders of the Oath-sworn and defenders of their god.
It is their task to guard Enuk Manamee from further harm,
and to ensure the survival of the Oath-sworn long enough to restore Enuk Manamee to his former power.
It is expected that at some stage in their lives they will perform some quest,
such as leading a band of Long Spears or skilling one of the dreaded snowbeasts.
They are the teachers of cult members.

### Requirements

All Rune Lords must be men.
They must have been initiates for at least five winters,
rightfully upholding the laws of the Oath.
As with becoming an Initiate,
they must go out into the winter,
this time for the entire season,
and kill some beast or monster
(non-Oath-sworn men count).

A prospective Rune Lord must be 90% in Snow Survival
and at least 90% in Spear (any style)
and one skill *not* listed in the lay membership section.
He must also be 90% or better in two of the following:
Camouflage, Bow, Shield, Tracking, Starsight, or Oratory,
and must know one fire spell as well as two points of Heat.
One point of characteristic POW is sacrificed upon becoming a Rune Lord.
Other requirements are as listed in *RuneQuest*.

### Restrictions

A Rune Lord of Enuk Manamee exists first and foremost to protect his god.
Anything which might possibly be a threat must be destroyed or driven off without reckoning the cost.
The secondary responsibility is to ensure the cult's survival so that Enuk Manamee may be made whole again.
Anyone not of Ice, Darkness, or Air must be sheltered and offered whatever is the Lord's to share.
No Rune Lord of Enuk Manamee will use Divine Intervention for purely personal reasons:
the dragin on the god is too high.

Each High Holy Day the Rune Lord must re-swear the Oath and sacrifice one point of characteristic POW.
To avoid being completely drained over the years,
a Rune Lord must lead an active and adventurous life...

### Benefits

For ecoming a Rune Lord,
the cult member has the honor of being a bulwark between Enuk Manamee and his enemies.
On a more mundane level,
along with all the advantages listed in *RuneQuest*,
Rune Lord become band leaders,
and receive gifts from the band members once each year.
They have first chance to trade with non-Oath-sworn,
and may marry as often as desired.
They will usually attracted several dedicated Initiates as students and followers.
They may lead a Long Spears band;
they may gain an Allied Spirit (usually that of some past Lord or Priest).
If possible,
they will be given iron armor and weapons by the cult.
However,
because of teh scarcity of the metal in the tundra,
the possible gaining of these always requires a quest.

## Rune Priesthood

### General Statement

The Rune Priests of Enuk Manamee,
both male and female,
are the ones responsible for restoring him to health and power.
As such,
they are subservient to the Lords in times of danger but take precedence in times of prosperity.
Like the Rune Lords,
they are leaders among the Oath-sworn,
and are expected to teach any cult members of their band.

### Requirements

The candidate must have a POW of 18 or greater,
know at least 3 points of Heat and three other fire spells,
and have sacrificed at least once as an Initiate for Rune Magic.
They must have upheld the Oath,
and have been an Initiate for at least five winters.
Finally,
they must spend one winter alone,
during which time they must capture and tame one of the animals of the snows
to later serve as a familiar for some Rune Lord's allied spirit.

### Restrictions

The restrictions on Rune Priests are the same as those on Rune Lords.
Additionally,
the Rune Priests are expected to compose chants of the events in their band's travels.
Once each High Holy Day,
the priest must sacrifice one point of characteristic POW.
No spell is gained from this.
All Priests must learn how to teach magic as soon as possible.

### Benefits

Again,
the benefits of being a Rune Priest parallel those of the Rune Lord.
All ceremonies are officiated by priests.
The final authority in the cult,
short of Enuk Manamee himself,
is vested in the High Priest at Weeping.

### Rune Spell Compatibility

All one and two point Rune Magic is available to this cult,
with the exception of Multispell II, Reflection, and Summon Elemental.
(The power of Summoning was lost to the Ice Gods.)

### Cult Spells

Rune Priests (and other cult members) have the following cult-special spells available from Enuk Manamee:

#### Freeze Fire

- Cost: 1 POW
- Range: touch
- Non-stackable, reusable
- Duration: Until used

This spell causes one cooking-sized fire to become dormant.
The flames and heat disappear until such time as someone touches the material
and recites a brief prayer (one round) to Enuk Manamee.
The flames then reappear.
Such frozen torches will be carried by almost every Initiate or Rune level character in various numbers.
The chant to release the fire is taught in every band.

#### Suspend Animation

- Cost: 3 POW
- Range: 40 meters
- Non-stackable, non-reusable
- Duration: indefinite

This spell,
which may not be cast on an unwilling subject,
causes all life functions to be frozen for an indefinite period.
No deterioration takes place,
and no further damage from poison or disease occurs (although these are not cured).
The subject remains in this state until conditions surrounding him or her become favorable for reawakening.
This spell is usually used to save oneself from the winter's cold,
and it is not an unusual sight in the spring to see a body,
apparently frozen,
lying in some sheltered niche away from predators,
waiting for summer's warm or some passing friend to build a fire to warm it back to life.

## Subservient Cults

### Spirit of Reprisal

There is no spirit of reprisal for this cult.
Any member who forswears the Oath is expelled from the cult and his band
and earns the undying enmity of those who remain faithful.
He or she may be hunted as an animal by would-be Initiates and Lords.
In the harsh tundra,
this is usually sufficient.
Note that raising weapons in anger against a fellow cult member,
or stealing from a cult member,
is considered a betral of the Oath.

### Anga Kok

Anga Kok was an early leader of the Oath-sworn who sacrificed himself in the Second Winter to save his band.
From him,
the cult gains a special magic: Sacrifice.
Only Priests and Lords may use this magic.
Any Priest or Lord of the Oath-sworn may sacrifice *all* (and only all) of his or her characteristic POW to save the band.
In exchange for this,
the spirit of Anga Kok will drive toward the band
sufficient food for twice as many people as the sacrificer had POW.

This magic is only used in dire situations to save the band from starvation.
It was needed more in the First Age than in the Second or Third,
but remains as a reminder of the obligations of Lord or Priest to the cult.
It is not learned:
anyone of Rune status can use it,
and it is automatically successful.
It will only work in the tundra.

## General Notes

### Encounters

Few bands of northerners will ever travel far enough to meet Enuk Manamee's cult in the tundra.
However,
Long Spears bands often travel North,
and it is these people that a character could bump into.
The "average" Long Spears band (if such a thing exists)
contains a senior Lord or Priest,
three or four subservient Lords and Priests,
and fifteen to forty Initiates.

Like any group of people in a strange land,
Long Spears tend to be very clannish in their attitudes and habits,
and very protective of one another.
They will often join other fire-related cults,
usually as a group.
They will also participate in any Ice- or Darkness-hunt near them,
and have earned the respect of many Lawful cults.

### Attitudes

The harsh tundra makes survival itself a victory,
and the Enukna (as they call themselves) have survived in style.
A hgih proportion of the Oath-sworn become Lords and Priests;
most families can boast at least one.
Unwilling to admit even the possibility of defeat,
they take a justifiable pride in the survival of their god.

# Taigaluk the Hunter

## Mythos and History

**Before Time**
No tales are told of Taigaluk from the Golden Age,
when food was plentiful and easily found.
He is first mentioned as the one who taught hunting and the ways of beasts to men
during the Lesser and Greater Darkness on the tundra,
when the eart turned cold and the world seemed doomed.
He hunted and slew many survivors of the Devil's army during the Dawn Age,
hating their love of pain and senseless killing.

**Since Time**
Taigaluk has remained a solitary god,
epitomizing the hunter's way of life.
He guides the tundra's quiet loners,
giving them a useful place outside their society.
There have been heroes in the cult,
and tales of particularly cunning or brave hunters are often told at the campfire.

**Life After Death**
Those who follow Taigaluk become one with him after death,
to watch and guide those who hunt.
No Taigalukna are resurrected,
as the practice is abhorrent to this death god.
Some may be returned briefly as beasts to challenge and tests those who remain.

As with other tundra cults,
burial is performed by piling a cairn of rocks upon the dead.
Hunters are always buried alone with no mark on the cairn.

**Runic Associations**
Taigaluk has the Runes of Beast, Death, and Movement.

## Nature of the Cult

**Reason for Continued Existence**
Taigaluk's following is a haven for loners in a society to interdependent that little privacy exists.
His teachings provide solitude for those who desire it.
In the polygamous northern culture,
there are many unattached men who find Taigaluk's way appealing.
Hunters occasionally lead groups of lay members for brief periods
when there is game on the tundra,
and serve as newsbearers or messengers.

**Social/Political Position and Power**
The Taigalukna are not particularly liked or disliked
(except by the Enukna, who dislike everyone).
They are valued for their skills and teaching,
and admired for their resourcefulness and confidence,
but their self-reliance makes them alien to other tundra people.

**Particular Likes and Dislikes**
Cult members show active dislike of those who hunt for pleasure or take joy in pain.
This disapproval is quiet,
but cautionary tales of men tracked and slain by angered Taigalukna are well-known.

Many cult members dislike chaos and hunt its creatures wherever they are found.
Taigaluk does not require this, however,
and chaotic beings with the necessary self-control have occasionally gained entrance into the cult.

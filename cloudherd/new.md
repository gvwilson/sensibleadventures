## Prolog

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, its single
continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer
shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet speck of life as a
child might cup a drop of water in her hand.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as
well.  Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a century-long
Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of
glass, and littered the land with strange magic.  When it was over the
Pilots were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.*

*Now look there, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless
squabbles of the Ninety-Nine Kingdoms.  A girl is doing her chores.
No longer a child but not yet an adult, she has no idea that her world
is about to change forever...*

----------------------------------------

## Chapter 1

Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale.
Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a
clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked between the
twisted mountain pines.

"Shoo."  She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick.  It waved
its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away.  Noxy cut
the anchor threads of its with two practiced twists of her knife and
began winding it onto a stick.

"Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?" Sensy asked,
pulling a branch aside to see if another web lay beneath it.

Noxy glanced at her.  "Why? Are those ones coming loose?"

Sensy looked down at her soft brown yakskin coat critically.  "No.
They're just kind of plain."  She sighed wistfully.  "Granna Fee has
some really nice red ones.  She said she'd give them to me if I weeded
her pepper garden."

"Her whole garden?"  Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web and
stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder.
"That's a lot of work for some buttons you don't really need."

"Oh, you're no help," Sensy pouted.  She had spent the winter
embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar.
All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes and her
hair and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't
possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale.  Especially
Rash---practically *anyone* would be more fun to be around than Rash.

"A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes," Granna Fee
had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who
seemed to have taken her best friend's place.

"Not me!" Noxy had declared.

Granna Fee had laughed and ruffled her granddaughter's hair.  "No,
daffodil, not you."

Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted,
"Soldiers! Soldiers!"

"Oh, great," she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy.  The whole point
of going out to collect spiderwebs that morning had been to get *away*
from the younger children for a few hours.

Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked
himself up and ran to the two girls.  "There's soldiers in the
village!" he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve.  "And
they've been fighting!  And there's a *tiger* with them!"

"Sure," Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away.  "And there's a
dragon under your bed."  The pass below Stale were still blanketed in
snow.  Avalanches happened almost every day---someone would have to be
foolish *and* desperate to be on the road this early in the spring.

"But there *are*!" Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to
another with excitement.  "They've got swords, and some of them are
bleeding!  And the tiger can *talk*!"

Noxy opened her mouth to say, "Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?"
but a deep *doom doom* cut her off.  She and Sensy looked at each
other wide-eyed.  *Doom doom*, pause.  *Doom doom*, pause.  It was
Stale's home drum.  It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had
wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed
help to find their way home.  It meant trouble.

Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch.  "Come on!" she told Sensy,
setting off at a run.

"I told you!" Young Gas shouted behind them. "I told you there
was---hey, wait for me!"

Patches of ice made the path slippery underfoot, but Noxy didn't slow
down until she reached the ridge overlooking the village.  There, in a
clearing left by a long-ago lighting strike, she paused to catch her
breath.

The ancient walls of the fortress of Stale lay below her.  Rain and
snow had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look
like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as
solid as the mountains themselves.

The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the walls like
ducklings in a nest.  Thin wisps of smoke rose from their slate
chimneys, while vegetable plots and racks of drying spiderwebs filled
the spaces between them.

To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.  A
net woven from squirrel spiders' webs was stretched over its top, as
light as a dream but as strong as steel.  Another net hung down at the
gorge's mouth to make a gate.  Inside, just visible from the ridge,
two gray clouds drifted half-asleep.

Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds,
riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them.
Grownups called the pair slow and lazy, but they were the most
exciting things in Noxy's world---except, of course, for the herd of
half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance.

Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her hand.  "Wait!"
she hissed, pointing into the trees.  For a moment all Noxy saw was
branches.  Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and suddenly she could
make out a hairy form in the trees.

Noxy's mouth went dry.  She felt Sensy squeezed her hand, and squeezed
back.  As long as they didn't startle it...

Little Gas burst out of the bushes behind them and ran headlong into
Noxy.  "Oof!" he exclaimed, "What are you---mmph!"

"Sh!" Noxy whispered urgently, her hand clamped over his mouth.
"Don't... move..."

Before Young Gas could protest, the troll stepped into the clearing.
His fur was silvered with age, and his eyes seemed as old as the
mountains themselves.  He and Noxy stared at each other for one long
moment before he leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up
into the tree.  After one last look, he disappeared into the greenery.

Sensy was the first to speak.  "Wh-what's a troll doing *here*?" she
asked shakily, still holding Noxy's hand.

Noxy shook her head.  "Worry about that later.  Come on!"

The drum had stopped booming by the time the children reached the
fortress wall.  An enormous stone door stood half-open at the
entrance, its iron hinges melted in some long-ago battle.  The wooden
gate that Stale's current human inhabitants had built to fill the gap
was made of whole tree trunks, but still looked like a child's toy
next to the Pilots' ancient work.

Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the main
square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who
had left a week ago to collect Stale's clouds from their wintering
grounds in the high peaks.  Three hundred people were there, from
babies in their mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, all in an
uncertain muttering half-circle.

A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front of them.  Each one had a
battle mask painted with fierce swirls of red and black pushed up on
top of his head.  Leather armor, as thick as bootsoles and studded
with metal, protected their bodies, while heavy wool kilts reached
from their waists to their knees.  Some had swords in scabbards on
their hips, while others had bows or spears, but each had a heavy pack
on his back.

And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting.  One man's hand
was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling.
None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard
faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.

But Noxy didn't see any of that right away.  What she saw instead was
the tiger.  His stripes were dark brown on tan, not black on orange
like the picture in the story book that three generations of village
children had passed from hand to hand.  A pair of golden earrings hung
from his left ear, and his tail twitched now and again as if the
villagers' murmurs reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.

A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack
as large as any of theirs.  Four half-healed scars ran across his
cheek, glistening redly against his near-black skin.  His back was
straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was from cold,
weariness, or fear, Noxy couldn't tell.

Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve.  "Who *are* they?"

"Sh!" Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know.
"I'm trying to hear!"

Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and
stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the
square.  "Friends," she said in what Noxy thought of as her official
voice, "Friends, please.  I know it is early in the year for
travellers, but please greet Sergeant Dorbu and the Gifted Kulbinder."

The soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers.  The
tiger merely blinked.  "They and their companions will be our guests
for the next little while," Indy continued.  "I trust you will all
make them welcome."

"How long's a little while?" Grappa Gas asked loudly.  Noxy saw her
mother wince.  Everyone loved Grappa Gas---or nearly everyone---but as
Granna Fee said, sometimes he had the manners of a constipated yak.

"Until they are ready to travel again," Indy reassured him.  Her eyes
swept across the crowd.  "Their journey has been a hard one---they
hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans.
Sergeant?  Would you like to say a few words?"

The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as
Indy stepped down.  Like his men, his skin was black compared to the
villagers' brown, and his head was fuzzy with wiry stubble.  The two
yellow ribbons around his sleeve were the only sign of his rank.

Before he could open his mouth, Grappa Gas asked, "So, are you lot
loyalists or rebels?"

"I'm sure he'll tell us if you give him a chance to speak!"  Heads
turned as a burly man, all shoulders and scowl, pushed to the front of
the crowd.

"Uh oh," Noxy said under her breath.  Grappa Gas's son Aft was the
best cloudherd in Stale, at least in his own estimation.  After one
too many arguments over plans for the summer cloud drive, Indy had
ordered him to stay behind and mend equipment instead of going with
the other adults.  Grappa Gas had happily taken the mayor's side, and
father and son had been squabbling non-stop ever since.

"Um, thank you, honored," the soldier said.  "And thank you, people of
Stale.  As your mayor said, my comrades and I were trying to see if
the pass was clear so that we could carry news to Chaghan.  We---" He
paused, and for a moment Noxy could see how exhausted he was.  "There
was an avalanche.  Three days ago.  It drove those of us who survived
off the road into the forest.  Everything seemed all right at first,
but then the forest took offence and..."  He shrugged.  "Well, you can
guess what happened next."

The villagers murmured.  The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso
Mountains from Uws in the south to Garheim's frigid shores in the
north.  It didn't hate humans the way the Jungle of Thind did, but it
guarded its territory as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs.
Gifted creatures that wanted to live in the forest did so on
sufferance, while humans were not welcome at all, not unless they
stuck to the handful of roads built long ago by the Pilots.
Travellers who strayed off them were rarely given warnings, and
*never* given second chances.

A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he
continued.  "The worst of our wounded couldn't go any further, so our
commander made camp and sent us here for help."  All traces of his
earlier smile were gone.  "That was yesterday morning.  I pray they
are still safe, but if they are, they won't be for much longer."

Grappa Gas broke the silence that followed.  "So which side *are* you
on?" he asked, his voice still loud but a notch less rude.

"I have the privilege of serving Respected Shudarga in this matter,"
Sergeant Dorbu answered calmly.

A handful of oldsters gasped at the rebel leader's name, but Aft
crossed his arms and nodded approvingly.  "Good for you!" he said
firmly, his glare daring his father to disagree.

Grappa Gas thumped his wooden leg loudly on the cobblestones.  "Good
for them, maybe, but what about us?  If the king's men come looking
for you, these walls won't keep them out for long."

"Quiet, both of you!" Indy said sharply.  She was a head shorter than
either of the men, but the iron in her voice left no room for
argument.  She nodded at the sergeant.  "Please, go ahead."

The sergeants shook his head.  "We didn't choose Stale for its walls,
honored.  We didn't really choose it at all.  We just washed up here
because we need help.  If you're afraid that'll bring trouble, we'll
understand if you send us on our way."

"Nobody is sending anyone away," Indy said firmly.  "We may not have
as much as some, but we take pride in our hospitality.  I'm sure we
can find some spare blankets to keep you warm and something better
than hardtack to feed you for as long as you need to stay."

"Thank you, honored," the sergeant said.  "But what we really want is
a couple of clouds so that we can go and rescue our friends."

----------------------------------------

## Chapter 2

The next five minutes were chaos.  Out of the question, Grappa Gas
said, whacking his wooden leg with his cane for emphasis.  The king's
law might overlook them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who
wandered in out of the cold, but flying off to rescue their friends?
Why, when the *tralpa* came back---

---they'd show him the gate and send him on his way, Aft cut in, arms
crossed and brows knotted.  The lazy good-for-nothing had run for the
capital the moment word of the rebellion had reached the mountains,
and hadn't been seen since.  As far as Aft was concerned, he'd given
up any right he ever had to tell people what the law was or wasn't.
And anyway, if they were going to shelter rebels, it wouldn't matter
if they'd come to Stale or Stale had gone to them.  And anyway again,
what would folk in other villages say if they heard that Stalers had
left men in the forest to die?  Saints, what would their own folk say
when they got back?

The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones.  Little
whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart
as people disagreed with their neighbors, or turned around to agree
with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet another
"what if?"

"This is going to go on forever," Noxy sighed.  She and Sensy had
stayed aloof on the sidelines, old enough to want to be part of the
grownup discussion, but young enough that the whole thing seemed
vaguely ridiculous.

"It's so stupid," Sensy agreed.  "I mean, they're all going to wind up
doing whatever your mother wants them to."

"Unless they get eaten by a *tiger*!"  The two girls shrieked and
jumped as sharp fingers poked them in the ribs.

"Rash!  Don't!"  Sensy punched the smirking boy in the arm.  "I *hate*
it when you sneak up on me!"

"I know," Rash smirked, running a thumb over the lip fuzz he insisted
on calling a mustache.  It had become a habit over the winter, one
that Noxy had told him countless times he ought to break before
*someone* broke his stupid finger.  "But it's better than being eaten,
isn't it?"

"The tiger's not going to eat anyone, you big yak," Noxy said as
scornfully as she could, her heart still racing.

"How do you know?  He looks awfully hungry to me."  Rash licked his
lips and growled.  "Mmm... tasty, tasty human."

"Stop it," Sensy said, punching his arm again.  "I mean it."

"Ow."  Rash rubbed his arm, looking genuinely surprised at the force
of Sensy's blow.  "I'm just kidding."

"Well, it's not funny," Sensy grumbled, hugging herself.  Stale's
walls sheltered the square from the mountain winds, but the air was
still cold.

"Anyway," Rash said, not quite rolling his eyes, "What I want to know
is, do we get to go on this rescue mission, or are we going to be
stuck here with the littles again."

"Of course we'll get to go!" Noxy exclaimed.

"Really?"  Rash ran his thumb over his mustache again.  "Then why
isn't anyone ordering us around?"

Noxy opened her mouth, closed it, then grunted, "Wait here."

She strode toward the center of the square where her mother was
speaking with the sergeant.  The tiger sat impassively on his haunches
next to them, twitching his tail at every sudden sound.  The boy with
the scarred face stood beside him.  His face was beyond exhausted, but
when his shoulders started to droop, the tiger growled quietly and he
snapped to attention again.

Noxy's mother caught sight of her.  "Oh, and this is my daughter,
Probably Noxious."

"Honored Noxious."  The sergeant bowed slightly.

Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was
immediately annoyed at herself.  Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a
silly lowlander custom.  "Just call me Noxy," she told him.  "*Amma*,
which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on?  We can go and start
getting them ready while everyone's jawing."

Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well.  "Who said
anything about you three going?"

But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and
had already assembled her arguments.  They were definitely old
enough---why, they were all going to be riding *real* clouds in a few
weeks, not just tame old pair floating about in the cloud pen.  And
they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down the pass, and it
was really important for cloudherds to know how to do rescues, wasn't
it?  And---

"Stop."  Her mother held up a hand.  "You can go.  But!" she
continued, "But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna Fee, and that's
all you do---ride.  Understood?"

Noxy nodded, trying and failing to suppress a triumphant grin.  "Yes,
*amma*."  As she turned to go, she heard her mother sigh and Sergeant
Dorbu say, "My men do that to me all the time too."

Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and more than a
few tinkers and traders had been lifted out of a difficult spot after
running into a bear or a pack of trolls, so it only took the villagers
a few minutes to gather what they needed.  Coils of hemp rope with
spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen,
and everyone kept an extra yakskin cap somewhere, just in case.

"You look ridiculous," Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the
wooden steps to the mounting platform.  The older men had been
teaching him how to embroider during the winter's enforced idleness,
and had stitched what he claimed were eagle's wings onto the side
flaps of his cap.

Rash looked her up and down.  "Really?  Because I think you look
amazing.  Excuse me."  He winked at Noxy and stepped around the pair
of speechless thirteen-year-old girls to take his place on the
platform.

"Ears all!" Aft called out, clapping his hands.  Despite the cold, he
only wore a sleeveless yakskin vest, knee-length wool shorts, and a
sturdy pair of boots.  His hair was braided back in a thick club with
a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven through it for
luck.  "I'm fore on Big Blue, Gas and Fee will ride spotter on Pillow.
We'll down, lift, and out, quick and simple, and get our new friends
back here for soup before you can sneeze.  No adventures, right?"  He
turned a steely glare toward Noxy, Sensy, and Rash, who nodded and
mumbled, "No adventures."

"Right!"  Without any more more ceremony than that he walked to the
end of the plank that jutted out from the platform, looked down to
check that Big Blue was below him, and jumped.

Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath.  One, two, three...
Big Blue dimpled under Aft's weight as the burly cloudherd hit him
dead center, sending gray waves rippling across the cloud's back.  Aft
rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly.  Noxy
couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in
concentration as he mind-spoke to the cloud to rouse it from its
morning doze.

Something twinged in the back of her head.  She blinked, momentarily
disoriented.  "Did you say something?" she asked her friends.

"I said, show-off," Rash replied, a note of envy in his voice.  "Look,
he's coming up."

Noxy shook her head, the strange feeling already half-forgotten as Big
Blue rose slowly toward the platform, bunching in on itself as it
came.  Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the cloud's
back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.

A silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, trilling its
startled displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away.
Aft looked up and smiled they way he only did when he was on a cloud.
"You want me to get Pillow for you?"  he called up to his father.

"No need, I can---damn that boy!"  Grappa Gas harrumphed as Aft took
three long strides across Big Blue's back and launched himself into
the air again.

Rash whistled.  "Nice leap," he said appreciatively as Aft landed
squarely in the middle of Pillow's back with an audible *poof!* "And
blind, too."

"It's not such a trick," Noxy said dismissively, though she was
secretly impressed.  "He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she
was."

"Sure, but would you trust a cloud's eyes that much?"  Rash challenged
her.  "Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out of what
they say."

Noxy shrugged.  She had realized early in their training that
mind-talking was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash,
or even for some of the olders who had been riding clouds for years.
She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of
showing off.  The only person she shared her progress with now was
Granna Fee, and even she didn't---

*Twinge.* She winced and put her hand on the back of her head.  There
it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?

This time Sensy noticed.  "Are you all right?"

"Sure," Noxy lied.  One of the few things Aft and Grappa Gas agreed on
was that cloudherds shouldn't fly if they were sick, so she wasn't
going to admit to anything that might give them an excuse to leave her
behind.

Grappa Gas pulled a small scrimshawed yak horn from the leather sheath
on his belt.  "Here," he said, handing it to Rash.  "Let's see if
you've been paying attention to your lessons."

The boy nodded and raised it to his lips to blow two long notes, *dee*
*dah*.  Big Blue obediently turned and drifted over to the platform.
It was hard to train a cloud to answer to sound, and much less
reliable than mind-speech, but it was one of the hundred skills the
teens had to master if they hoped to ride the giant creatures on their
own some day.

Aft brought Pillow up next to Big Blue and stepped off nonchalantly.
With a mutter and a glare, Grappa Gas told the teenagers to get on,
get on, they didn't have all day.  He and Granna Fee followed.  "Oof,"
Noxy's grandmother said as she sat cross-legged.  "That's not as easy
as it used to be."  But then she smiled like the girl she had once
been and put her arm around Noxy.  Her granddaughter leaned against
her the way she had so many times before, wondering when and how her
grandmother had grown so small.

Behind them, Rash nudged Sensy with his elbow.  "You can lean on me if
you get cold, you know."

Sensy sniffed.  "I don't expect I'll ever get *that* cold."

Granna Fee pressed her hand against Pillow and closed her eyes.  The
cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the spiderweb gate
that hung down over mouth of the gorge.  Meanwhile, two of Stale's
other oldsters climbed aboard Big Blue.  As they took their places
behind Aft, the cloud slowly began to sink.

"Hold him there," Indy called to Aft.  She turned to Sergeant Dorbu.
"Go ahead---jump."

"Um..."  Sergeant Dorbu looked from the cloud to Indy and back again.
"Wouldn't it have been simpler for me just to climb on like everyone
else?"

"Absolutely," Indy said.  "But everyone has to jump their first time.
For luck," she added cheerfully.

"If you say so, honored," the sergeant replied dubiously.  He glanced
at the two soldiers beside him.  With muttered prayers to the Pilots
to watch over them, the three men pulled their battle masks down over
their faces and jumped.

*Poof!* *Poof!* *Poof!* The three lowland soldiers hit the cloud
feet-first and immediately toppled over.

"Mind yourself, he's a bit slippery," Aft said as the sergeant and his
men struggled unsuccessfully to stand.  "Probably best if you just
sit.  You'll spook him if you keep tumbling about like that."

"Ready?" Granna Fee called from Pillow's back.  Without waiting for an
answer, she turned the cloud toward the cloud pen's gate, muttering
softly as she mind-spoke her orders.

Cloudherding is cold work.  In the spring, in the mountains, when
breath still fogs at mid-day and the wind pokes its fingers through
every loose seam and down every collar, it's beyond freezing.  A
hundred heartbeats after they left the cloud pen, Granna Fee had
wrapped a fleece around herself and Noxy, leaving only their faces
exposed.  Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy said, he might
be a yak, but at least he was a *warm* yak.

Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected.  "Saints and their inventions, but
I miss this," he sighed.  He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden
leg on so that it wouldn't poke into Pillow, but was dressed in the
same long coat and scarf that he had been wearing when the soldiers
arrived.  "Look, the condors are back in their nest!  We should invite
them them to visit some time."

"They're not really the most sociable of creatures," Granna Fee said
dryly.

Grappa Gas harrumphed.  "You just have to get to know them."

"Do you think they'd want to meet the tiger?" Noxy asked.  "I mean,
another Gifted might..."  She trailed off.

"Let's worry about today before we start making social arrangements,"
Granna Fee said.

It had taken Sergeant Dorbu and his men a day to hike up the pass to
Stale Leftovers.  The clouds covered the same distance in less than an
hour, even with the headwind.  "There," Granna Fee said, pointing at a
thin plume of smoke.

Grappa Gas frowned.  "I thought he said there were just a few of
them."

Granna Fee frowned too.  "Maybe 'a few' means something different to
lowlanders."

The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren outcrop of rock that rose
out of the forest like an island.  Two dozen drab gray tents huddled
around a small fire.  Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw a
handful of men moving about, some propped against one another to stay
upright.

Grappa Gas gave a low whistle.  "Aft's not going to like this."

"Neither is my daughter," Granna Fee replied darkly.

One of the injured soldiers spotted the clouds a moment later.  The
cloudherds were too far away to hear his shouts, but there was no
mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms.  Other soldiers
crawled out of their tents and began waving and shouting as well as
Aft steered Big Blue in a long arc to the upwind side of the outcrop.
After a brief argument conducted via tooted horns, Granna Fee had
Pillow hover directly above the camp.

"You lot keep your eyes wide," Grappa Gas ordered the teenagers
curtly.  "Forest might be happy to let us take them, or it might not."

Big Blue descended until he bumped against the edge of the outcrop,
his back level with its top.  The older cloudherds riding with Aft
stayed on board while he strode forward, barking orders to hurry the
soldiers along.  Only a few windborne words reached Noxy, but that was
enough for her to know that he was telling the injured men to leave
their gear, to leave their tents, to leave everything they couldn't
pick up *right away*.

In singles and pairs, the men struggled to clamber onto Big Blue's
back.  A few wore their battle masks, but most had tied them out of
the way on the backs of their helmets.  It made them look like a doll
Noxy had once seen with one happy face and one sad, except the
soldiers' looked fierce and weary.

The older cloudherds helped drag the worst of the injured onto the
cloud, spacing the soldiers out to keep their weight balanced.
Meanwhile, a soldier began arguing with Aft, pointing at a large tent
standing a short distance away from the others.  Other soldiers joined
in, until Aft was facing a half-circle of angry men.

Finally he threw up his hands in surrender.  Noxy couldn't hear what
he said, but half a dozen men broke away from the group and hurried as
best they could toward the tent.  As their comrades climbed onto
Pillow, Aft made sweeping motions with his arm and pointed at the
outcrop.

"No no no," Grappa Gas muttered.  "You can take them all, lad, just
get them loaded up and get out of there."

"What?  What's happening?" Noxy asked.

"Butter-brain wants us to come in and load the rest," Grappa Gas said
angrily.  "But look---over there!"

Something brown moved behind the trees a dozen strides from the lower
edge of the outcrop.  Something else---something larger---briefly let
itself be seen a few strides further away.  In singles and pairs and
packs, the forest was mustering.

Grappa Gas spat over Pillow's side.  "They're holding back for now,"
he said.  "But if we go in, they'll be on us like an avalanche."

"It's not your decision to make," Granna Fee told him.  "Aft's riding
fore on this one, and---"

"---and you follow your fore.  I know, I know.  Saints."  Grappa Gas
looked like he wanted to spit again.

Granna Fee pressed her palm into Pillow's back and closed her eyes.
The cloud began to descend.

Grappa Gas glared at the three teenagers.  "You see something, you
shout, got it?"

"Yes, grappa," Noxy said.  Rash and Sensy just nodded.

Ten heartbeats, twenty... They were level with the camp.  Granna Fee
halted their descent long enough for Pillow to lift off and drift out
of their way.  "Hurry up!" Grappa Gas shouted, waving urgently.

The soldiers who had gone back to the large tent struggled toward the
cloud, each with a heavy canvas-wrapped bundle on his shoulder.  As
they made their way through the camp, a cougar stepped out of the
trees.  Catching sight of it, the soldier at the end of the line
snatched a branch out of the fire and waved it, shouting, "Hah! Get
back! Hah!"

"Oh no," Granna Fee breathed.  Beside her, Grappa Gas swore fiercely
and yanked his slingshot out of his belt.  In one smooth motion he
folded its brace down against his forearm, pulled a water-smoothed
rock from his pocket, drew, aimed, and fired.

*Thwack!* Even from thirty strides away, Noxy heard the stone strike
the branch and send it flying.  "Run, you idiot, run!"  Grappa Gas
shouted.

It was too late.  The forest was awake, and angry.  Sensy shrieked as
a brown bear charged out of the trees to rear up on its hind legs and
roar, "Get them!"  Another bear joined it, then a cougar, and then the
trees were boiling with trolls, dozens of them, hooting and shaking
branches until it looked like the trees were trying to uproot
themselves.

"Get them!" the Gifted bear roared again, and the animals charged.
Bears and cougars, a snarling wolverine, trolls on all fours with
their teeth bared, all came roaring and snarling and hooting through
the camp, the Gifted and the ordinary side by side, their own feuds
forgotten because someone had raised fire against the forest.

The first of the soldiers fell to one knee, dragged himself back to
his feet, and fell forward onto Pillow's flank.  "I've got you!" Rash
shouted, dragging the bundle and then the soldier up onto the cloud.
Another, a third, a fourth, a fifth---

"Look out!" Noxy shouted at the last soldier as a cougar snarled and
launched itself at him.  The soldier spun around and flung up his hand
as if to signal *stop!*

The cougar crumpled mid-air and fell to the ground as though it had
hit an invisible wall.  The soldier doubled over to vomit, then
stumbled the last half dozen steps to the cloud.  Rash and Sensy
grabbed his bundle.  Noxy took his hand.  "Go! Go! Go!" she shouted.

Pillow pulled herself into the air.  A second cougar made a leap for
the soldier's dangling legs and snarled with rage as it missed them by
a handspan.  Noxy felt herself slipping under the soldier's weight,
but strong hands grabbed her shoulders.  Together, Grappa Gas and Rash
pulled her and the soldier onto the cloud.

Noxy rolled over and stood up.  "That was close," she said shakily.

"Too close.  Too *damned* close!"  Grappa Gas rounded on the soldier
he had saved.  "We could have been dinner, all of us, and for what?"
He whacked the long bundle beside the soldier with his cane.

The soldier surged to his feet and caught the old cloudherd's arm.
"Stop."  His voice was as cold as ice fields beneath them.

Grappa Gas tried to pull his arm free, but the soldier's grip was like
iron.  "Well that's a mess of a thank you!" he said angrily.

The soldier released him.  "My apologies.  And thank you."  He swept
his gaze across everyone on the cloud.  "Thank you all."

"Hmph."  Grappa Gas scowled at the impassive soldier.  "What was so
aching important you just couldn't leave it behind?"

"My men."  The soldier nodded toward the bundle at his feet, his face
set.  "I promised them we would give them a proper farewell."

Half a dozen expressions flitted across Grappa Gas's face as he
realized what their cargo was.  "Ah.  Hard world, lad, hard world."
He hesitated.  "And that magic you did---I hope it didn't cost more
than you can afford."

The soldier glanced over his shoulder.  Behind them, the forest
creatures were tearing every man-made thing in the camp to pieces.
"It doesn't matter.  All that matters is that my men are safe."

"Safe as houses, honored," one of the men beside Noxy said, his accent
as burred as any cloudherd's.  "And don't worry.  Stale's folk will
give your dead a proper send-off."

Grappa Gas spun around.  "You! What are *you* doing here?"

The man who had spoken wiped a his nose on his arm, leaving a long
streak of nose drool on his sleeve.  "Flying, by the looks of it.
Hey, Fee!"  He patted the cloud.  "Mind if I take over for a bit?"

----------------------------------------

## Chapter 3

Later, in the diary she kept hidden under her mattress even though she
knew her mother knew about it, Noxy wrote, "There was a lot of
shouting after that."  Grappa Gas did a lot of it, just like always,
but Granna Fee was almost incandescent.  That man was *not* going to
Stale.  As a matter of fact, the only place he was going was off her
cloud, right now, and the drop be damned.

"Because he's been shunned!" she said icily to the soldier who had
been last to board---who, it turned out, was the troop's commander.
"He's never to speak to a cloudherd, never to set foot in our
villages, and never, *ever* to ride a cloud again."

As weak as he obviously was, the commander didn't flinch under Granna
Fee's fury.  "We needed a guide.  He was the only one we could find."

"Would have been better off wandering around in circles than following
the likes of him," Grappa Gas said darkly.

The commander looked down at the canvas-wrapped body at his feet.
"Perhaps.  But what's done is done."

Nobody said anything after that.  Grappa Gas sat shoulder-to-shoulder
with Granna Fee, each apparently trying to out-scowl the other.  Noxy,
Rash, and Sensy huddled together in a vain attempt to keep warm.  The
commander sat next to the grimy ex-cloudherd and watched the mountains
slide past, while the soldiers did what soldiers always do when they
have a moment of peace: they fell asleep.  One started to snore,
stopping only when the commander nudged him with his boot.

With her hand on Pillow's back, Noxy could feel how unhappy the cloud
was.  It wasn't just that she was carrying strangers, or that those
strangers were bleeding and miserable.  When clouds died, they just
spread out into nothing.  The thought that something could end but
still be there---that it could go from being alive to being like a
rock or a log---made the canvas-wrapped bodies more frightening than
storm winds and lightning combined.

*Sh, sh, sh,* Noxy mind-spoke soothingly, stroking the cloud as if she
was an overgrown house cat.  *Home soon, then rest.* At that moment,
she wanted it just as much as the cloud.

Aft brought Big Blue down in the clearing in front of the fortress
gate.  An ankle-high carpet of ferns and spring-green shoots bent
under the cloud's weight as he settled into place.  The waiting
villagers helped the wounded soldiers to the ground and handed them
heavy blankets and steaming bowls of sweet dark tea.

Aft slid down Big Blue's flank and strode across the clearing to Indy.
Noxy was too far away to hear what he said, but from the angry way he
waved his arms and the way her mother rounded on Sergeant Dorbu, she
could imagine the conversation.  Even more soldiers?  And the forest
had attacked?  This was more than Stale had bargained for---a lot
more.

"Hasn't fallen down yet," the rescued mountaineer said, wiping his
nose on his sleeve again to punctuate his disappointment.

"Stow it, Yestevan," Grappa Gas growled.  "I hear another word out of
you, and I'll put you over the side."

A cold shiver ran up Noxy's back.  She and Sensy exchanged wide-eyed
looks.  People weren't supposed to talk about someone who had been
shunned, but older children had whispered this one when grownups
weren't around.

Yestevan just grinned at Grappa Gas, then winked at the two girls when
he saw they were looking at him.  Noxy glared in return, while Sensy
huddled closer to Rash, not seeming to mind the protective arm he put
around her.

"Look---there's the tiger," Rash said, pointing.

Noxy shaded her eyes with her hand.  Kulbinder was sitting on his
haunches on the parapet of the wall above them, watching the second
cloud come in with the same unimpressed expression that cats
everywhere mastered long before they tamed human beings.  His boy
stood beside him, leaning forward to look down at the clearing.  As
Noxy watched, the tiger hopped down off the parapet, disappearing from
view with his boy behind him.

Grappa Gas glanced at Noxy.  "Your *amma* isn't going to like this."

"Sh." Granna Fee waved a hand to quiet him.  "I'm trying to land."

Pillow touched down gently.  "Help the men get down," Grappa Gas
ordered the three teenagers.  "I'll take care of the bodies."

"I can give you a hand with that," Yestevan said, rising to his feet.

"You stay out of the way," Grappa Gas said curtly.

"Easy, old man, easy."  The former cloudherd raised his hands in mock
surrender.  "Just trying to help."  He sat down again, grinning as if
he'd just scored a point in a game no-one else was playing.

It took a few moments to slide the bodies down the cloud's flank into
the arms of the waiting soldiers and onto the stretchers they had
rigged out of blankets and alder poles.  When Indy offered the
villagers' help, Sergeant Dorbu shook his head politely but firmly.
"These are ours," he said.  "Though we'd be grateful if you could
gather some wood for a pyre---we'd like to send them off tonight."

<!-- FIXME: introduce the commander -->

<!-- FIXME: get Thokmay into the fight -->

Whatever the mayor might have said in reply was lost as Yestevan slid
off the cloud and sketched a bow.  "Greetings, honored.  Everyone."
He straightened up and rubbed his back as if to work out the kinks.
"Long ride, that.  Glad to be back on the ground."

There was a moment of shocked silence, and then Indy said, "What are
*you* doing here?" in a bewildered little voice that Noxy would never
have imagined could come out of her mother's mouth.

The commander's face was drawn, and beads of sweat were pearled on his
face despite the cold air, but his voice was steady.  "He is with us."

Everything seemed to happen at once after that.  Aft had been speaking
to Sergeant Dorbu.  When he heard Indy, he spun around, and when he
saw Yestevan standing there grinning, he balled his hands into fists,
took three quick steps, and threw a roundhouse punch that knocked
Yestevan flying.

Or at least he tried to.  As Aft swung, the commander swept his arm in
a perfectly-timed circle that knocked the punch to the side.  His
other arm followed the first, somehow sending Aft tumbling head over
heels onto the ground.

The tiger was there before anyone else could make sense of what had
just happened.  As Aft rolled over onto his feet, he found himself
face to face with a mouthful of very sharp teeth.  "Honored?" the
tiger rumbled.

"Let him up," the commander said.  "And then..."  With no more warning
than that, he collapsed as the willpower that had kept him on his feet
finally ran out.

Once again, everything seemed to happen at once.  Under Sergeant
Dorbu's direction, two soldiers rigged a stretcher out of poles and
blankets, lifted the commander onto it, and followed Indy through the
gate.  Granna Fee stood between Aft and Yestevan, each glaring at the
other with arms crossed, while Grappa Gas reluctantly admitted to
Sergeant Dorbu that no, the shunning didn't extend to the forest, and
yes, that meant that Yestevan could pitch a tent there if he wanted
to.  "He can make a fire too for all I care," the old man added
pointedly.  "A nice big one, right around the oldest tree he can
find."

Sergeant Dorbu beckoned to the tiger's boy.  "You, Thokmay!  Go fetch
a tent.  And a bowl of something---anything you can find."

"You're not giving him any of *our* food," Grappa Gas said hotly.

"Of course not," the sergeant replied soothingly.  "I'm giving him
some of ours."

Grappa Gas threw up his hands.  "Fine.  Come on, lad, let's get these
clouds back in their pens."  He climbed back onto Pillow, laid his
hand on the cloud's back, and lifted off.  A moment later, still
muttering, Aft guided Big Blue into the air behind him.

"Well," Noxy said awkwardly, not sure what to do next.  "I guess I'll
go see if my *amma* has any chores for me."

"If she doesn't, you can do some of mine," Rash replied, as he had a
hundred times before.  He glanced at Sensy.  "I guess we should go be
useful too."

"I guess," she said.  "See you later, Noxy."

"See you," Noxy echoed, feeling slightly bewildered as her two best
friends walked away together.

Whatever else Noxy might have thought was cut off by a now-familiar
twinge in the back of her head.  A heartbeat later she heard the
staccato blatting of Aft's horn come from the cloud pen, the quick,
angry pattern that meant "back away and give me some room".  She
caught her breath.  Grappa Gas must have been bringing Pillow in too
slowly for Aft's liking, but how could she have known that before she
heard the horn?

Her mother was organizing people in the square when Noxy got there.
Yes, the soldiers would stay in the trading hall---where else would
they go?  No, she didn't know why the commander had collapsed, but
Granna Fee was looking after him, and she was sure he would be all
right.  And yes, there *were* a lot more than 'a few' of them, but
there was nothing they could do about that now.

Indy caught sight of her daughter.  "There you are.  I need you to go
home and make some tea.  Use the big pot, and all the honey we have
left.  I have the feeling we're going to have lots of visitors."

"That's what I was *going* to do," Noxy muttered to herself, but her
heart wasn't in the complaint.  This was the biggest thing that had
happened in the village since she'd been a little girl, and she was
more than a little proud that it was her mother sorting it out.

The water hadn't even boiled before Grappa Gas showed up.  He rapped
on the door with his cane and entered without waiting for a hello.
"Hey, daffodil.  Where's your *amma*?"

"She should be back soon," Noxy said.  She added a handful of tea
leaves to the cinnamon bark and green cardamom pods already in the
pot.  It was an extravagance---the pack traders who brought such
delicacies to the village wouldn't be back until the last of the snow
had melted in the pass, which was at least another month away---but
Granna Fee had always said that a good cup of tea was worth a thousand
words.

"Mind if I sit?" Grappa Gas asked, settling himself on a stool that
was at least as old as he was and watching hungrily as Noxy drizzled
the last of the honey into the pot.

"What did you find out?" Noxy asked after a moment.

The old man snorted.  "Just like your mother, aren't you? And your
granna, too.  Always thinking one step ahead of everyone else." He
smiled.  "You know, if your granna hadn't been so smart, I might've
wound up being your grappa.  I remember once when---"

"Grappa!" Noxy protested.  "Tell me what the soldiers said!"

"And how do you know they said anything?" Grappa Gas challenged her.

"Because they're a long way from home, and tired, and sore, and want
us all to like them," Indy answered, closing the front door behind her
as she came in.  "And because I saw you duck into the trading hall on
your way down from the cloud pen.  Now, what did you find out?" She
kissed the old man on his grizzled cheek and sat on the other stool.

For a moment all Grappa Gas could think of was how alike mother and
daughter were.  Noxy's hair might be brown and with a slight wave
instead of straight and black, and her jaw square instead of round,
but they had the same quick minds.  When Indy had turned ten, he had
predicted that she would be mayor before she was thirty.  *Better
start telling everyone that Noxy's going to take the job too,* he
thought.

"The king's men hit them while they were crossing the ford below Duck
Droppings," he told Indy.  "Just bad luck, but they were split between
the two sides of the river when they were attacked.  Their commander
did some sort of magic to help them get away, but..."  For a moment
his years showed on his face.  "Fellow I spoke to doesn't expect
expect he'll see many of his friends again."

Indy glanced at Noxy.  "This doesn't go out of this house," she
warned.  Noxy nodded, turning to the stove as the lid on the kettle
began to whistle.  She lifted it carefully with a pair of sticks to
pour the boiling water into the tea, then replaced it on the stove and
set the teapot on the table to steep.

"What about the rebellion?" Indy asked.

Grappa Gas frowned.  "They didn't say it, but the king is winning.
And about time, too---he's got help now from half his neighbors, all
worried that Shudarga's craziness might be contagious.  If you ask
me---"

The front door banged open.  Aft strode in and glared at Indy.  "How
soon is that rotting turd leaving?" he demanded.

"Well, good day to you too," Grappa Gas muttered.

Aft ignored his father.  "How soon, Indy? You know you can't let him
stay.  He's been shunned!"

"Glad to hear you talking sense for once," Grappa Gas said.  "But the
real question is how quickly we can get those rebels back on the road.
They've no place here."

Aft crossed his arms.  "Seems to me they have every right to be here."

"Stop!"  Indy stood up and pointed at the stool she had been sitting
on.  "Sit down and make yourself comfortable.  Noxy, go get me the
peeling stool from the kitchen."

Aft glowered at his father a moment longer, then hooked Indy's stool
with his foot and pulled it to him.  The brightly-painted stool
creaked in protest under his weight as he sat down.

Noxy put the peeling stool down for her mother, then tried to make
herself invisible as she poured tea while Grappa Gas counted off the
reasons the rebels couldn't stay.  What if the king sent an army after
them?  Wait, what did he mean "if", of course he would.  There were
only three hundred people in Stale, and only half a dozen of them had
ever held a sword.  Not that they *had* any swords.  And even if they
had---

"I'm surprised to hear you say all this," Indy interrupted.  "I
thought if anyone would invoke travellers'' law, it would be you."

"Well, of course we have to look after them while they're here," the
old man blustered.  "But this is different.  When the king's men come
looking for this lot, they're going to fight, and---"

"And until then, we'll make them as welcome as anyone else," Aft cut
in.  "Just like the law says.  They can stay as long as they don't
raise a hand against one of ours or another traveller."

"Raise a hand?"  Grappa Gas laughed angrily.  "You just got tossed
backside over teakettle, and you're worried about their hands?"

Aft's face darkened.  Before he could loose another volley, Indy
slapped the table with her hand.  "Enough!"  Enough, both of you.  We
have a stormload of trouble to fly through, and I will *not* have you
making it worse with your bickering."

Noxy set a mug of tea in front of her mother and two others in front
of Grappa Gas and his son.  Indy stared into hers as if hoping the
tiny swirling leaves might spell out the answers she needed.  "I know
it's a big thing," she went on quietly.  "And I did think about
turning them away, but look at them.  They look like they've been
through the Blight.  If a storm caught them in the pass, they wouldn't
even make it as far as Rancid.  How would that make us look?"

Grappa Gas scowled.  "What people think won't matter much if our heads
are all on posts.  No, wait, hear me out."  He slurped his tea and set
the mug down with a clatter.  "What we just did, saving travellers who
got caught on the mountain, we can explain that if we have to.  But
letting them stay here---saints and all their gifts, Indy, we can't.
We just can't.  Never mind the trouble it'll bring when the king
wins---yes, I said *when*, and you know as well as I do that's what's
going to happen---never mind the trouble, it's three dozen mouths to
feed when we're already down to our last sack of barley."

"And what about the tiger?" he continued as Indy and Aft both started
to reply.  "What are we supposed to feed it?  Or should I ask 'who'?"

"Gastric Discomfort!" Indy snapped.  "I will *not* have that kind of
talk about one of the Gifted.  Especially not in front of my
daughter."

"Hmph!" Grappa Gas snorted, which was as close as he ever got to
apologizing.  "All I can say is, let's hope we don't get snowed in out
of season, because if we do, I'm going to be keeping myself behind a
good strong door."

As he leaned back, nodding in agreement with himself, Aft leaned
forward.  "What I want to know is, what are you going to do
about... *him*."  From the way he said it, Noxy didn't have to guess
who he meant.

Indy lowered her eyes and studied her tea again.  "Leave him where he
is for now.  I know, I know."  She held up a hand to cut off whatever
Aft had been about to say.  "If he stays out of the village and we
don't talk to him or feed him, we don't have to do anything."

"That's some pretty fine stitching," Grappa Gas grumbled.  "Hope the
other villages will wear it when they hear about all of this."

Indy looked from father to son and back again, then laughed.  "Well,
if you two are agreeing on something, it *must* be the end of the
world."  She drained her tea and set her mug down with a thump.  "It's
been a long day.  Let's all sleep on it and talk again in the morning."

Aft and Grappa Gas nodded and drank the last of their tea, setting
their mugs down with same "conversation is over" thump as Indy.
Grappa Gas swirled the last few drops in his mouth.  "It's good," he
said to Noxy.  "Maybe wants more cinnamon next time, though."

"I'll try to remember," Noxy promised.

After Aft left, Indy asked Grappa Gas, "Will you stay for dinner?"

He shook his head.  "Thanks, girl, but I promised your mother I'd help
her, um, peel some potatoes."  He winked, ignoring Noxy's little 'eww'
of disgust.  Indy smiled and kissed him on the cheek again.  He was
humming as he left.

Noxy waited until her mother said down again before saying,
"*Amma*...?"

"Yes, daffodil?"

Noxy hesitated.  She didn't know where to start.  "Do you think the
king really is going to come looking for them?"

Indy sighed.  "I hope not.  But what I really hope is that they aren't
here long enough for us to have to worry about that."

The summer before, after years of ever-louder protests, a bookbinder
named Shudarga had gathered her followers and marched on the capital.
Grappa Gas had taken the royalists' side.  Aft had argued just as
loudly that the villagers should support the rebellion.  After all,
what had the king's law done for them except take half of what they
brought home at the end of every summer and tell them they couldn't
build a bigger fishpond?  As the arguments grew more heated, Indy had
taken the mayor's heavy embroidered collar out of its velvet-lined
box, put it on, and laid down the law.  This was the lowlanders'
fight. The people of Stale Leftovers were *not* going to take either
side, not while she was mayor, and if anyone didn't like it, they
could have an election right then and there to sort it out.  Anyone?
No?  All right, then, why didn't everyone get back to their chores,
because they weren't going to do themselves.

The two sat in silence for a moment.  Finally Indy stretched.  "So
tell me, did you collect some spiderwebs, or did you and Sensy spend
the whole day mooning after Rash?"

"*Amma*! And how can you think about spiderwebs on a day like this?
And anyway, Sensy's the one who's mooning after Rash and that stupid
moustache he's trying to grow.  *I* think it's dumb."

"If you say so."  Indy raised her arms and stretched.  "Now, what are
we---"

*Crash!* Mother and daughter jumped as something landed on the roof
above their heads, sending tiles skittering down to shatter on the
cobblestones outside.  A low, menacing yowl sent ice up Noxy's spine.

"What in the Pilots' names...?"  Indy crossed the floor in three steps
and threw open the door just in time to see a troll land in the narrow
street in front of their house.  She yelped and flung herself to the
side as the hairy creature lunged past her and raced up the stairs on
all fours.

The tiger hit the cobblestones a heartbeat later.  "Where is it? Which
way did it go?" he demanded, his ears back and his tail lashing.

The sound of a shutter being flung open upstairs answered his question
before Indy could.  "Stop!  What in the saints' names are you
*doing*?"

"He was spying on us!" the tiger snarled.  "Now let me pass!"

"No!"  As the tiger came forward, Indy stepped into the doorway to
block him.

He pulled up short with a snarl.  "I said *let me pass!*"

"And I said *no!*" The mayor of Stale glared at the tiger, her eyes
lit with the same angry light as his.  "This is *our* village, and you
will *not* race around like a madman unless *I* say so, is that
clear?"

It was the bravest thing Noxy had ever seen her mother do, and for one
breathless moment, she thought it would be the last.  The muscles in
the tiger's shoulders bunched.  He braced his legs to charge---and
then, just as suddenly, relaxed.

"As you say," he growled, his tail twitching.  "But I still want to
know who that damn chimpanzee was spying for."

"We call them 'trolls' here," Indy said, her voice still full of
steel.  "They are our neighbors, and I imagine he was doing what any
neighbor would do if a bunch of strangers showed up next door---having
a look to see what's going on."

"There was a troll up by the spiderweb orchard this morning," Noxy
said, immediately wishing she hadn't when two heads turned to stare at
her.  "Sensy and I---we saw it when were coming back down."

"How come you didn't tell me?" her mother demanded.

"It's been kind of busy!" Noxy said defensively.  "Anyway, it wasn't
the same one.  It was older.  A lot older."

The tiger sat on his haunches.  "Is this normal here?
Chimp---*trolls* coming this close to a human settlement?  Because
they very much keep to themselves in Thind."

"They usually do the same thing here," Indy said.  She uncrossed her
arms and gestured.  "But if we're going to talk about it, would you
like to sit down?"

The tiger regarded her coolly for a moment, then blinked and looked
away.  "Thank you," he said, his voice calm once again.  "Perhaps some
other time.  I should see if the sergeant needs me."  And without any
more goodbye than that, he rose and loped out the door.

A moment later his boy leaned in, said, "Sorry about that," and gently
pulled the door closed.

Noxy let out her breath in a long whoosh.  "Well," she said shakily.
"That wasn't scary at all."

Her mother sat back down on her stool and squeezed her daughter's
hand.  "Hardly at all," she agreed.  "Are you all right?"

Noxy nodded.  "Sure," she lied.

Indy squeezed her hand again.  "Good.  Let's scramble some eggs and
call it a day."  She took down their one frying pan and set it on the
stove beside the kettle.  "Tomorrow, I'm going to see if I can get to
know the sergeant a little better.  And I think you ought to get to
know the tiger's boy.  Let's see if we can find out if they have any
other surprises tucked away."

----------------------------------------

## Chapter 4

"Oh daffodil, please, brush your hair!" Indy set her tea down on the
table and began to stand.

"I can do it," Noxy protested. "I'm not a baby." She dragged the brush
she and her mother shared through her hair another few times. "Is that
better?"

Her mother sighed, just as her own mother once had. "Yes, I suppose.
Honestly, someone would think you'd been possessed by lightning.
Let's get going.  We don't want to keep them waiting."

They walked through the village together, squinting in the sharp-edged
morning sun.  The air smelled of pine smoke and fried eggs.  People
sat in twos and threes on stools outside their houses wearing yakskin
coats or thick sweaters above sturdy trousers and sturdier boots.  The
men knit or embroidered while the women picked spiderwebs apart apart
and wound the strands onto spools.

Indy had to stop every dozen strides to answer the same questions.
How were the soldiers getting on? What did they think of the village?
"We're on our way to ask," she replied over and over again.

Many of the village's oldsters didn't bother to hide their unhappiness
about their guests, but the sourest face was Grappa Gas's.  "Has that
tiger eaten anyone yet?" he asked, forcing an awl through a scrap of
leather.  "Or is he too busy racing around on rooftops?"

There was no sign of the tiger when they reached the village square,
but Sergeant Dorbu was sitting on the steps of the trading with a
dozen wary but curious children in front of him.  Sensy and Rash
looked up as Noxy arrived.  Noxy blinked.  Had they been holding
hands?

"And this is called a greave," the sergeant said, pointing at the
armored front of his boot.  "It's to protect me from vampire mice.
See?" He tapped it with his fingernail, *clunk*.  "They could bite
that if they wanted, but all they'd do is blunt their teeth."

"What if they climbed up your leg?" asked Sensy.  Noxy rolled her
eyes.  Sensy could always be counted on to ask the questions grownups
wanted to hear.

"Ah, well, then I'd---oh, hello, mayor." The sergeant stood up,
brushing his hands on his kilt.  "The boy will be out in a heartbeat."

"Thank you, sergeant," said Indy.  "My daughter is looking forward to
showing him the village.  I trust you slept well?"

"Yes, thank you," said the sergeant.  "Although I..." He blinked, then
sniffed, then started to say, "Excuse me," but the sneeze came first.
*Hwah!* One of the younger children giggled, then clapped her hand
over her mouth.  The sergeant blinked and sniffed again.  "Sorry---too
many nights in the snow."

"Visitors from down below often catch colds in our thin air," said
Indy sympathetically.  "I hope it passes quickly."

<!-- FIXME: explain that the commander has no name -->

<!-- FIXME: mention Yestevan -->

The guesthouse door opened before the sergeant could reply.  The
children scrambled to their feet and stepped back as the tiger padded
out into the sunlight.  He wasn't as big as he'd been in Noxy's dreams
during the night, but she still had to stop herself from reaching for
her mother's hand.

His boy slipped out behind him and closed the door.  Instead of his
armor, he wore a plain brown rain cape.  He kept his eyes downcast as
the tiger said, "Good morning, mayor."

"Good morning, respected," Indy replied.  "I trust you slept well?"

"Thank you, I did." The tiger seemed not to notice that thirty pairs
of eyes were staring at him.  *He must be used to it,* Noxy thought.

Indy waited a moment to see if he would say anything more.  When he
didn't, she smiled and said, "My daughter has asked if you could spare
your boy for an hour so that she could show him our village while the
other children do their chores."  Noxy heard Rash mutter something at
that.  "If he would like to---oh dear." She stopped mid-sentence as
the sergeant took a deep breath and scrunched up his face.  "Nope," he
whooshed a moment later, blinking.  "That one's not ripe yet."

"You'd be better in bed than tramping around the countryside,
sergeant," Kulbinder rumbled.

"I agree," said Indy firmly.  "My mother will make you some lemon
ginger tea.  That will set you right in no time."

"Thang you," the sergeant said stuffily.  "Honored tiger, will you---"

"I will explore the forest," the tiger declared.  "I would rather we
were not surprised as we were at the ford."  And with no more ceremony
than that, he padded off toward the main gate.

<!-- ask about the commander -->

Indy clapped her hands.  "Right.  Everyone else, time for chores."  As
the children groaned and got to their feet, the tiger's boy finally
raised his eyes to look at Noxy.

"Hello," he said, stepping down to the cobblestones and bowing ever so
slightly.  "My name is Thokmay.  I'm pleased to meet you."

Noxy stuck out her hand.  "Hi.  I'm Probably Noxious, but call me
Noxy---everyone does."

The boy hesitated for a heartbeat, then shook her hand with a strong,
callused grip.  He gestured toward the gate.  "After you."

They set off side by side.  "That's the South Tower," said Noxy,
pointing at six rectangular stories of stone.  "It still has a roof,
but the stairs inside fell down a long time ago.  You used to be able
to get up there by climbing a tree, but they cut it down after Grappa
Gas fell out of it when he was little and broke his arm.  And that
one's the Round Tower, and the short one over there is called the
Quick Tower, because it's quickest to get up."

"It's a shame they've been allowed to go to ruin," said Thokmay.
"Respected Shudarga's engineers have been working all year to
strengthen the walls of Panday Castle.  Perhaps when the war is over
she could send some here to fix them."

"Perhaps," Noxy replied vaguely.  She wondered how Grappa Gas would
feel about having rebel engineers clambering around the village's
wall.  "Oh, and that's Granna Fee's house, the one with the moss green
door.  She's my grandmother.  And she teaches school.  And that's
Grappa Gas's house, with the lavender one.  He used to be mayor before
my *amma*.  And that's, um, well, they're all just different people's
houses.  Except those ones---those aren't houses, they're just for
stores and drying things and... Well, stuff," she trailed off,
embarrassed by her own rush of words.

Thokmay had a polite but absent look on his face, just like the one
Indy got when Grappa Gas started talking about how things had been in
his day.  *It's probably not much compared to a real castle,* she
thought glumly.  Two-story houses with steep shingled roofs, little
vegetable gardens nestled between log runners, and all around, sharp
mountain peaks looming over the ancient gray walls...  She wouldn't
have believed how strange it all seemed to the young man beside her.

They walked in silence along the path that ran beneath the wall.
Ancient cobblestones showed through the hard-packed dirt in a few
places.  Noxy scuffed crusts of frost off a few absentmindedly,
wondering what else to say.

Thokmay pulled up short.  "What is that?" he asked.  A heavy wooden
grill lay across a shoulder-high opening in the wall ahead of them.
Behind it, rough stone steps led down into the mountain.

"It's just an old tunnel," said Noxy.  "The grownups say they're
dangerous, so we're not supposed to go in."

Thokmay nodded.  "Sergeant Dorbu will want to know about them."

"Why?" Noxy asked.  "They don't go anywhere---or at least, that's what
everybody says," she amended hastily.  "We use the ones by the
shearing shed as yak pens, but that's about it."

"He'll still want to know.  Soldiers should know as much as they can
about their surroundings," Thokmay said, as if repeating a lesson to a
slow learner.

Noxy bit back a retort.  "Come on," she said.  "We can see more from
up top."

The steps lay flush against the side of the wall.  They had been built
for the Pilots, not for human beings, so each one was as high as
Noxy's knee, and so broad that it took her two strides to cross.  Even
after hundreds of years, the stones fit together so snugly that it was
hard to tell where one ended and the next began.

Noxy put her hand on the wall to give herself a little extra push on
each stair.  She noticed Thokmay puffing and sweating after the first
few steps, but didn't slow down.

The top of the wall was wide enough for three soldiers to march side
by side.  The parapet along its outer edge was interrupted here and
there by slits for lookouts and archers.  "Makes Your Breath Rancid is
that way," Noxy said, pointing.  "You can't see it because the valley
bends, but sometimes you can see their clouds coming out of their
pen."

"Why do you call your villages things like that?" the young soldier
asked.

Noxy shrugged.  "They're called dragon names.  They're supposed to
make things sound unappetizing, so that when the dragons finally fly,
they'll think twice about eating us."

Thokmay snorted.  "That seems pretty far-fetched."

"Well, where does *your* name come from?" Noxy bristled.

"From the army," he replied, not looking at her.  "I had another name
in the orphanage, but the army gave me a new one."

"Oh."  Noxy cast about for something to say.  "Was that when you
started working with the tiger?"

"I don't work with him---I work *for* him," Thokmay corrected, running
his fingers across the scars on his face.

Noxy hesitated.  "Is that why you have those?  To show that you're,
you're..." She floundered, unable to think of a better way to say what
she thought than "an animal's servant".

Thokmay pulled his hand away from his face.  "No.  I got those for
trying to desert."

Noxy opened her mouth, then closed it.  For once, she had no idea what
to say.

Thokmay didn't seem to notice.  Learning through one of the archer
slits in the parapet, he pointed into the gorge below.  "Are those the
clouds we were on?"

Noxy glanced through the neighboring slit.  "Yup.  The bull is Big
Blue, and the cow is Pillow.  We've had them forever---they're
practically tame."

The two old clouds were hardly moving, but Noxy could have watched
them for hours---and had, many times, especially when she was supposed
to be doing chores.  She loved the way they slowly changed shape as
they drifted about, and how soft they felt when she stroked them.
Being on a cloud was like riding on a grownup's shoulders when you
were little, only a thousand times better.  You could see
everything---deer grazing beneath the twisted pines, wild yaks
standing on rocky ledges no wider than the heel of a boot,
broad-winged condors making slow circles as they waited for a rabbit
to forget to look up...  When the air was still, and the cloud was
just drifting, it felt like the whole world was a story that was about
to be told for the very first time.

Thokmay stepped back.  "They smelled like wet yaks."

"That was just because they haven't rained for a while," Noxy
explained defensively.  "We'll probably take them out tomorrow and let
them rain over the fishpond.  Here, come with me."

Descending the stairs was even harder on her knees than climbing them.
Rather than cutting directly through the village, she led Thokmay on a
roundabout path through the vegetable plots around its edges.  She had
seen the looks Sensy and Rash had given her when her mother had sent
them off to do chores while she showed their youngest visitor around,
and she wasn't keen to bump into them until they'd had a chance to
cool off.

Once through the gate, she followed the trail at the base of the wall
to the steps that led down to the cloud pen.  Big Blue and Pillow were
both floating fifty strides away in the middle of the gorge.  The bull
was almost at their height, while the cow drifted further down in his
shadow.

"Can you call them over?" Thokmay asked.

Noxy shook her head.  "Not without a horn.  You have to be touching
them to mind-speak with them.  That's what the ropes and cradle seat
are for---see?  A lot of clouds never learn to answer a horn, so
someone has to be reeled out above them so they can jump on from
there.  It's pretty dangerous," she added airily.

"I suppose," Thokmay said.  He wrinkled his nose.  "But I still think
they smell like wet yaks."

Noxy bit back an angry retort.  They didn't smell anything *like*
yaks, not really, and if he thought they did, then---

*Twinge.* "Ouch," she muttered, putting her hand on the back of her
head.  The feeling of something tugging the inside of her head was so
strong this time that she was surprised not to find a lump.

"Are you all right?" Thokmay asked, eyeing her.

"I'm fine," she snapped.  She closed her eyes.  She had hoped the
clouds would be right next to the mounting platform so that he could
stroke one.  Or even get on, though she knew what her mother would say
if she found out.  "Never fly alone" was one of the many rules she
dared not break---not unless she wanted to be grounded.

"Um...  Are they supposed to be doing that?"  She opened her eyes at
Thokmay's worried question and blinked in surprise.  Big Blue was no
longer drifting in the breeze.  Instead, he had turned and was flying
straight for them.  Pillow was rising toward the platform as well.

Noxy looked up.  The last time she had seen clouds move this fast
without a rider driving them on, there had been a pack of lightnings
snapping and sizzling above the peaks.  But she couldn't see anything
like that---anything at all.  What had gotten into them?

*Bump.* Thokmay stepped back as the clouds nudged the mounting
platform.  Noxy pushed her question out of her mind and leaned forward
to stroke Big Blue's flank.  "See?" she said to Thokmay, grabbing a
double handful of Big Blue's side and drawing it out.  "You can pull
them all which way, but it settles back after a while."  When she let
go, the cloud's flank slowly settled back into its original shape.

Thokmay patted Big Blue gingerly.  Noxy grinned at his caution.  She'd
show *him* wet yaks.  "Here, do this."  She backed up, then ran at the
cloud and threw herself onto his back.  *Poof!* "Come on!" she said
airily as Thokmay hesitated.  "He won't bite."

"Noxious Aftertaste!  What do you think you're doing?"  Noxy's heart
leaped into her throat.  There, at the top of the steps that led down
to the platform, stood her mother and Sergeant Dorbu.  "You get off
that cloud *right now*, young lady!"

Noxy's stomach was in knots by the time they reached the fortress
gate.  Her mother hadn't said a word to her on the walk back.  "Thank
you for the tour," Thokmay said politely, putting out his hand.

"You're welcome," Noxy mumbled.  She shook his hand, dreading the
storm she knew was coming.

"And thank you as well," Sergeant Dorbu told Indy, bowing slightly
over her hand as he clasped it.  "It was a pleasure."

"You're welcome," the mayor said.  If she had been anyone but Noxy's
mother, Noxy would have said she was blushing slightly.

As the sergeant walked away with Thokmay beside him, Indy rounded on
her daughter.  "Tell me," she said coldly, "What exactly would have
happened if you'd slipped off the cloud?  Or if *he* slipped?"

"He wouldn't have slipped off!" Noxy protested.  "It was Big
Blue---he's as safe as---"

"I don't care if it was Big Blue or the mattress on your bed!" Indy
said angrily, ignoring the half-dozen villagers who were very intently
*not* listening just a few strides away.  "Do you know what the
soldiers are doing this afternoon?  Do you?  They're settling all
their friends who died before we could get to them.  What do you think
they'd say if we had to tell them there was one more to settle, just
because you wanted to show off?"

"Yes, mayor," Noxy said wretchedly.

"Don't you 'yes, mayor' me.  Now, Achy gave me some thimbleberries as
swap for those old boots you'd outgrown.  I want you to get the seeds
out so that I can make a pie for dinner."

"Thimbleberries?" Noxy said in despair.  "That'll take forever!  Rash
and Sensy and I were going to---"

"Well, you should have thought of that, shouldn't you?"  Indy took
Noxy by the shoulders.  "Daffodil, listen to me.  *Really* listen."
She combed her daughter's hair off her forehead with her fingers.
"Half the village is so upset about this that they're saying it's time
for a new mayor.  How can I ask them to behave when my own daughter
won't? Now, go get washed up and start on those thimbleberries."

Noxy nodded glumly.  "Yes, *amma*."

She moped home to collect the bucket full of the first spring
thimbleberries and a large bowl, then climbed to the top of the Quick
Tower.  She and Sensy had covered a tumbled-down block of stone with a
bit of gray canvas to make a pretend cloud the year before.  Plopping
herself down on it, she started squeezing bitter grain-sized seeds out
of the thimbleberries one by one.  Why couldn't the stupid soldiers
have washed up somewhere else?  Why couldn't her mother have come
along five minutes earlier, or later?  And why did the sun have to be
so...so sunny?

When she heard the first shouts from the main square she ignored them,
thinking that it was children playing jump-sticks or *kabbadi*.  Then
she heard Sergeant Dorbu shout, "Hah! Heeeyah!" She tossed another
berry into the bowl and stood on her stone seat to look.

She was just in time to see Thokmay duck under the sweep of the
sergeant's sword and lunge with his own blade, shouting "Hah!" in
turn.  Both his blade and the sergeant's were wrapped in leather so
that they wouldn't cut.  Every child in the village was gathered to
watch, and not a few of the adults as well, while Kulbinder sat on his
haunches on the speaker's stone with his tail wrapped around him, his
eyes on the mock battle.

The sergeant knocked Thokmay's blade away and spun around, slashing
left and right as if he was beating off an invisible second opponent.
While his back was turned, the tiger's boy stepped forward and ran him
through.

Or tried to.  As Thokmay thrust, the sergeant spun around again and
beat his blade to the side.  Over, under, over, straight---blow after
blow rained down on Thokmay, each one barely deflected by his frantic
defense.

"Look out!" someone shouted exactly one heartbeat too late.  Unseen by
Thokmay, the tiger had hopped down from his perch and padded silently
into place behind him.  As Thokmay retreated under the sergeant's
relentless attack, he backed into the tiger and fell sprawling to the
cobblestones.

The crowd groaned in sympathy.  "That's not fair!" someone said
indignantly.

"Battles never are," Sergeant Dorbu said, raising his battlemask and
holding out his hand to help Thokmay to his feet.  "Remember, it's
what you *don't* see that will kill you."

"I'm sorry," Thokmay panted.  "I forgot." He picked up his sword as
the tiger strolled leisurely back to the speaker's stone.

Sergeant Dorbu lowered his battle mask into place.  He and Thokmay
brought their swords up, touched blades, and started fighting again.
Thokmay quickly lost again, and even from a distance Noxy could see
that he was getting frustrated.

"Again," Sergeant Dorbu ordered.  They touched blades.  *Thwack!*
*Thwack!* The sergeant attacked immediately, driving his smaller
opponent back once more.

Thokmay stumbled on a loose cobblestone.  The sergeant lunged---and
somehow Thokmay found his balance, twisting at the hips and sweeping
his free hand up to catch Sergeant Dorbu's sleeve and yank him
forward.  The leather-wrapped point of Thokmay's sword poked hard into
the sergeant's back.

A handful of children cheered.  Sergeant Dorbu pulled up his mask.
"Well done!" he said.  "That's quite a trick---where did you learn
it?"

Thokmay raised his own mask.  "I don't know.  I must have seen one of
the other men use it."

Sergeant Dorbu laughed.  "Well, then that's two of you keeping secrets
from me.  Come on, let's go again."

They practiced for another half an hour.  The children clapped and
cheered every time Thokmay scored a hit.  The older villagers shook
their heads, their disapproval written on their faces.  Still, they
kept watching.

By the time the sergeant and Thokmay stopped, they were both soaked
with sweat.  They saluted each other one last time.  "You're getting
better every day," Sergeant Dorbu said.  "But we could both use a
sauna."

Thokmay nodded, breathing hard.  "Smells like we could both use one
too," he said.  For the first time, Noxy saw him smile.

"Show me, show me!" shouted Little Gas.  He clapped his hands with
excitement.  "I want to play!"

Thokmay's smile froze.  He glanced at the sergeant, who shook his head
almost imperceptibly.  "I'm glad you liked it," the young soldier said
to Little Gas, pitching his voice to carry across the square.  "But
it's not really a game."

He squatted so that he was no taller than Little Gas.  "I can show you
something else if you like," he said.  He looked left then right, as
if to make sure no spies or grownups were listening.

"Do you have any spare socks at home?" he asked.  Little Gas nodded.
"Good.  You go and get me three pairs of socks, quick as you can, and
three stones the size of your thumb."

Little Gas bit his lip.  "I only have just one other pair of socks,"
he said.  "They're for when it's winter, so my feet will fit in my
boots."

"Um, well then," Thokmay said, "Do you think your mother would let you
borrow some of hers?  Just for a little bit?" Little Gas nodded
quickly and scurried away.

"Do you want the rest of us to get some socks, too?" Sensy asked
hopefully.  She and Rash had been standing with the younger children,
their chores either done or conveniently forgotten.

"Oh, Sensy!" Noxy said under her breath.

"If you like," Thokmay said, straightening up.  Sensy sprinted away, a
handful of other children scattering in her wake.

Little Gas came puffing back a moment later.  In his hands he had one
pair of green socks, one pair of gray, and one pair with red and white
stripes.  "Will these do?" he asked, fishing some stones out of his
pocket.

"They look fine," said Thokmay.  "Now, give me your stones...  Good.
The first thing we do is we roll up the socks like this, with a stone
in the middle, to make a ball.  See? And then the next pair...  And
the next...  Now, are you ready?" Little Gas nodded.

Thokmay stepped back, took a deep breath, and threw the balled-up
socks into the air.  His hands darted back and forth like
hummingbirds.  Somehow, he managed to catch each sock ball before it
fell to the ground, and then throw it again in time to catch the next
one.  He caught them overhand, he caught them underhand, he threw two
with his left hand while bouncing the third with his right, and then
he threw them all in the air at once and caught them, one, two, three.

There was a moment of stunned silence.  "That's magic!" Rash said
accusingly.  "You're doing magic!"

"It's not magic," Grappa Gas laughed, looking as delighted as any of
the children.  "It's called 'juggling'! I saw it in Chaghan once,
years ago.  It's just a trick."

"That's right," Thokmay agreed, "It's just a trick.  Here, I'll prove
it.  Sergeant?"

Sergeant Dorbu took the brightly colored sock balls and tossed them in
the air, one, two, three.  He whistled a happy little tune as he
juggled, and even managed to wink at Sensy (who blushed).  By the time
he was finished, Little Gas was laughing and clapping his hands.  "Let
me, let me!" he shrieked.  "I want to!"

"All right, but you have to let me show you how," Thokmay said.  "You
have to start with just two, like this.  Um, sergeant? Could you show
the older children how it's done? Thank you.  Now, put this one in
this hand, and this one in the other, and..."

Noxy watched Little Gas drop all three pairs of socks, pick them up,
and drop them again.  The little boy laughed.  Seething, she sat back
down on her pretend cloud and glared at the bowl of thimbleberries.
It was going to be a long day...

----------------------------------------

## Chapter 5

Noxy was still on her make-believe cloud an hour later, squeezing
seeds out of thimbleberries so angrily it was amazing the the bucket
didn't take fright and run away.  Sensy almost did when she reached
the top of the stairs, but then she plopped herself down beside her
friend.  "You should have tried it!"  she burbled.  "I only got them
all up a few times, but it was so much fun!  Rash could do it almost
right away."

"I'm sure it was wonderful," Noxy grumbled.

Sensy pouted.  "Don't be such a yak."

"I'm not being a yak!  I just think he was showing off.  And what did
Rash think about him putting his arms around you like that?" The last
time Noxy had looked at the juggling, Thokmay had been standing right
behind Sensy, reaching around to hold her arms just below the elbows.

Sensy brushed her hair back over her ear.  "Why should I care what
Rash thinks?" she asked sweetly.  Her grin turned into a leer.  "Or
maybe you're the one who cares?"

"Well, *I* think it was embarrassing," Noxy said primly.  "You were
all following him around like ducklings, just because he knew a stupid
trick."

"Well, at least he didn't make everyone say please nine times, like
you did when I wanted to play with the kite Granna Fee got you for
your nameday last year!"

Noxy's mouth fell open.  Sensy had never talked back to her before!

The same thought must have occurred to Sensy.  She looked down at the
bucket by Noxy's feet.  "Anyway, Grappa Gas is taking him for a ride
now.  It's instead of them going on patrol," she added hastily.  "The
soldiers, I mean.  Sergeant Dorbu said the commander ordered them to,
but then your *amma* said they couldn't, and then they had an
argument.  Well, not really an argument, more like Sergeant Dorbu
wouldn't take 'no for an answer and your *amma* wouldn't budge, so
they agreed that some of the soldiers could go up for a ride, and the
tiger was there and *he* said---"

"Never mind what the tiger said!" Noxy burst out.  "Aren't we all
supposed to be going out with Grappa Gas for training today?"

"Oh."  Sensy blinked.  "You're right.  I forgot.  But we can go out
any time.  If they're only here for a few days---"

Noxy stood and glared down at her.  "What if they're not?" she
demanded.  "What if Grappa Gas has to keep taking them out and we
don't get to fly and then we don't get to go with the herd this summer
because we're not ready?"

Sensy gaped at her.  Her mouth opened and closed a couple of times
before she managed to say, "Noxy, what are you talking about?
We're not going to be stuck here because---"

"But what if we are?" Noxy threw up her hands.  "What if---"

"Stop interrupting!"  Sensy stamped her foot, then clamped her hand
over her mouth.  The two girls stared at each other for a moment.
Neither could believe that Sensy had snapped at her friend.  Neither
understood what it meant, but they both knew it meant something.
Something had changed.  Something was going to change.  They were in
uncharted skies.

Sensy stood up abruptly.  "Sorry," she muttered.

"It's all right," Noxy muttered back.  "Listen, I've got to---"  She
gestured at the bucket of thimbleberries.

"Right.  Um... So I'll see you later?"

"Sure. Later."  Noxy made a little half-wave as Sensy turned and went
down the stairs two at a time, then sat back on her stool and kicked
the bucket hard enough to send thimbleberries skittering across the
stones.

*Twinge.* "Not again," she groaned.  She rubbed the back of her head
with her hand.  She still couldn't feel a lump.  Why did this keep
happening?

The second twinge a moment later was different.  It was a tug, like
the one she had felt that morning at the cloud pen.  On a sudden
impulse, she clambered onto the parapet to look down on the cloud pen.

Sure enough, Grappa Gas was just coaxing Thokmay onto Big Blue's back.
Noxy couldn't hear them, but from the beckoning motions Grappa Gas was
making, she could imagine what he was saying.  Littles jumped onto
clouds all the time---saints, sometimes their parents threw them on
when they were still in diapers, just so that they'd get used to the
feeling.  A strong young lad like Thokmay wasn't afraid, was he?

A moment more and Thokmay jumped.  Like every first-timer, he
immediately lost his footing and fell.  It only took him one
slow-moving try to get back up, though.  Against her own wishes, Noxy
was grudgingly impressed.

*He'll let Big Blue rain on the fishpond first,* she thought, *That
way, he won't be fidgety.*

Sure enough, Grappa Gas brought the cloud around in a graceful turn
toward the fishpond.  The old bull didn't need any more instruction
than that.  He drifted to a stop, then started to rain contentedly.
The pair of elders sitting on log benches beside the pond returned
Grappa Gas's wave.

Noxy closed her eyes.  She could practically mind-hear Big Blue's
contentment as he slowly turned from dark gray to light.  *Why don't
you just drop him in the pond?* she thought despondently.

*Bad,* she imagined Big Blue replying.  *Bad hurt.*

*Oh, he'd be all right,* she told herself.  *The pond's pretty deep.
And it'd serve him right for showing off with all his stupid juggling
and swording and stuff.* She imagined Big Blue thinning out underneath
Thokmay little by little.  He wouldn't notice right away, not on his
first-ever flight with Grappa Gas talking a gallop a breath beside
him.

She opened her eyes in shock at the sound of a faint yelp in the
distance.  There, a hundred strides below her, Thokmay was sinking
into the cloud.

"Hold on!" Grappa Gas shouted, reaching for him, but it was too
late. Thokmay shrieked as he fell through the hole in the cloud and
splashed into the ice-cold fishpond.

His head burst above water a moment later. "Help!" he screamed. "Help
me! I can't---" He thrashed his arms as if he was trying to swim, but
something was pulling him down.

Noxy's hand flew to her mouth. His armor!  He must still have it on
from when he and Sergeant Dorbu were fencing!  She watched in horror

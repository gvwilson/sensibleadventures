"Zillions..."
Iffy whispered.
Everyone knew those words---knew them and feared them.
Brazil had fought beside Australia and the rest of humanity when the machines rebelled,
but had turned on their allies once the bots were defeated.
"Este mundo!" they screamed
in books and sims.
"This world is God's!"
The earth's self-appointed defenders would sacrifice everything
to undo the damage humanity had done to the planet,
even their own species.
When a shaft in a coal mine collapsed
people blamed Zillion fanatics intent on driving humanity back into the stone age.
When a mutant fungus turned the contents of a greenhouse into sludge,
people demanded that the governors *do* something.
And when a Zillion trader was brave enough or stupid enough
to go more than a block or two from Halley's market
and woke up in hospital,
everyone just nodded straight-faced at the Marines' equally straight-faced apologies
for their drones' failure to record anything.

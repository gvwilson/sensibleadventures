## Episode 1: Stolen Arms

Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the center of the village square
when she heard one of the Ox brothers holler,
"Mail's coming!"
*Finally*, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were all in the right places,
but the lines on the page still didn't look like the drooping greenery in front of her.

She sighed and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made for her tenth birthday.
A lot had happened in the five years since then.
If the mail brought the news she'd been hoping for,
she might finally get to see her father again.

"Waitin' on anything in particular?"
a familar voice drawled behind her.
She jumped, startled, and swallowed a sudden lump of nervousness in her throat.

Mayor Lupus smiled down at her, showing sharp teeth.
She was still limping in the aftermath of the bots' assault on Rusty Bridge,
but apparently that didn't prevent her from moving quietly when she wanted to.
"Mama sent off for some seeds," Maddy said.
"And my chores were all done, and..."

"...and it's a beautiful sunny day so why not sit for a bit?"
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy's bag.
"You're getting a lot better.
Your daddy would be pleased."

"Thank you," Maddy mumbled.
The mayor had a way of looking at people that made them feel like she could read their mind.
Shaper Leaf said that wasa big part of why she'd been re-elected so many times:
everyone who even thought about running against felt guilty just thinking about it.

They waited on the steps of the mayor's house as a handful of people gathered
and shared the usual gossip and small talk.
Zeke the bear had finally finished fixing the wall of the smokehouse
that had been partly knocked down during the attack.
He still wasn't happy about bots living in the village
("Or whatever you call it, seein' as how they're not actually alive," someone commented),
but even he would admit that Crusher could lift twice as much
as the Ox brothers put together.
And they were certainly handy for fixing things up in general---the apple orchard
was draining properly for the first time in who knew how long,
and there wasn't a dull pair of scissors in the whole village.

"I'd just feel more comfortable about it if they'd let us pay them,"
Mama Tumbly sighed.
"Makes me uncomfortable, taking charity from a bot."

Mayor Lupus swallowed the last of her tea and tipped the dregs into the planter by her elbow.
"I reckon they figure being allowed to settle in beside us is payment enough," she said conversationally.
"Between that and getting a look at whatever salvage comes down the river,
I imagine they've got everything they want and a lot more than they used to have.
And if any trouble shows up, well..."
She rapped her gnarlywood cane against her mechanical leg.
"Fighting bots is a lot easier when you have a few on your side."

Mama Tumbly's whiskers twitched slightly under the rebuke.
She had run for mayor one summer,
but had won even fewer votes than Mayor Lupus's previous challenger.
"A lot of folks do think it's time for a change,"
Mama Roo had explained to Maddy,
"But if she's the only other choice, they'd rather wait."

"Anyway, there it is, right on time,"
Mayor Lupus said, pointing as the boxy mailbot came into view.
Eighty-Eight Able-Six ("but call me Able") looked like three metal boxes
perched preciously on top of one another
with two spoked cartwheels in the rear
and a single smaller wheel up front.
It only had one arm,
and like many of the bots who had come to Rusty Bridge
it had patches and welds where it had been mended over the years,
but somewhere along the way it had learned how to whistle,
and someone had made it a blue hat with a little tin badge
and it was quite possibly the happiest bot in the world.

Able bumped across the cobblestones,
braked,
backed up,
turned,
and doffed its hat.
"Good morning, one and all," it said jauntily,
reaching back with its other arm to open a hatch in its side.
"Got letters, got parcels, even got a newspaper from Sandy Bend."
Its periscope eyes swivelled one way and another as it began handing out what it had brought.

Someone bumped Maddy's elbow.
"Hey,"
Gumption said.

"Hey," she said back.
He had slicked back his fur again like some of the older goats, she noticed.
It made them look tough,
but on Gumption---she sighed to herself.
It had taken him months to heal after the bots had attacked.
Once he was back on his feet he'd started using the punching bag
in the yard beside the village school
and doing militia drills with a home-made pike.
Secretly she had hoped this would be the summer they went blackberry picking together,
just the two of them,
but "together" seemed to be the last thing on his mind.

Gumption jerked his chin at the mailbot.
"Anything for you?"

She was about to say, "Not yet,"
when Able called her name.
She traded a square glass penny for a letter in a plain brown envelope.
"Miz Madalena Roo, Resident in Rusty Bridge" was written in careful square letters on the front,
and a blue circle with Able's dot-and-dash ID inside it showed that it had been collected in good order.

Maddy took a deep breath.
"Well? You going to open it?"
Gumption asked.

She shook her head.
"Not here.
You want to go look in on Shaper Leaf?"

Gumption shrugged.
"Sure.
Sindy doing one of her special lessons?"

"Ssh!"
Maddy glanced around involuntarily,
but nobody was listening.
Only a handful of people and bots knew about her sister's special ability,
and Shaper Leaf was adamant that they keep it that way as long as they could.
"Never borrow trouble from tomorrow," he had said firmly
when Mama Roo had suggested that they at least let the mayor know.

Gumption shrugged again.
"Sorry," he muttered,
and then,
"Hey---look!"

Heads turned.
A murmur ran through the crowd.
"What in tarnation?" Able whistled
as two bots came toward them
with a pair of muddy, sullen goats between them.
Dockety was in the lead,
its mis-matched arms swinging as it marched toward the crowd.
Its companion Crusher brought up the rear on its heavy treads,
and in between---

"Are those boys *tied up*?"
Mama Tumbly gasped,
her ears standing straight up in shock.

"Let me handle this," Mayor Lupus said sharply as the murmuring turned to muttering.
The crowd parted to let her through,
her cane rapping on the cobblestones with every second step.

"Morning," she said loudly.
"I thought Able had brought all the mail,
but it seems like you have something for us as well."

The lenses on the front of Dockety's head rotated a quarter turn
and then snapped back into position
with a faint *zick zick*.
"These ones were apprehended
while attempting to take possession of items that do not belong to them,"
it said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
"We request punitive measures be taken to deter a repeat of such attempts."

Mayor Lupus sucked in her cheeks.
"Is that right, boys?
You were caught stealing?"

"We weren't stealin'!"
Bluster said vehemently.
"We were just tryin' to find out if they've been hidin' stuff from everyone,
and we did!
They got weapons stashed away!
All kinds of them!"

"Hush up!" Mayor Lupus said sharply to the villagers around her.
"That's a pretty serious accusation, Bluster Goat.
You best be sure of your ground before you go making it."

"Bravo seen 'em too," Bluster said.
His twin brother nodded vigorously.
"Big pile of stuff in one of those sheds they built,
all laid out with tools and wires and stuff."

"Those are not weapons,"
Dockety buzzed.
"They are spare parts.
Many of us still require repairs."

"Spare parts my tail!" Bluster said hotly.
"They got a thing looks like a zap gun,
and a buzz saw blade and all kinds.
They put 'em all together one night while we're sleepin'
and we'll all be in cage carts by sun-up!"

"Dockety?
Any of that true?"
the mayor asked conversationally,
but Maddy saw the way her ears flattened.

The bot's lenses rotated back and forth.
"These ones possess several saw blades," the bot acknowledged.
It gestured at Crusher.
"This one has been using one of them to clear brush,
and it needed sharpening."

"And the zap gun?"

"It is not operational," Dockety said.
"But if we are able to repair it,
we will use it only for defensive purposes."

"Says *you*," someone said just loudly enough to be heard.

Mayor Lupus raised a hand to quell the muttered replies.
"Operational or not,
it would have been neighborly of you to let us know you had that."

"Noted," Dockety said.

"And you two,"
the mayor continued,
turning a cold glare on the goat twins.
"It's not your business to be poking around in other folks' business.
No,
no,
don't interrupt me,
I'm not done.
They all have just as much right to be here now as anyone,
and more than you do if you keep practicing nonsense like this.
You're both on ditch duty for the next month,
and if I so much as sniff a whiff of you doing something this lump stupid again,
I promise you'll be looking back on ditches like they were your first summer love.
You both have that straight?"

Bluster opened his mouth to protest,
but snapped it shut when Bravo kicked the side of his leg.
"Yes'm," he said sullenly.

"Yes'm," Bravo echoed.

"All right then.
Untie them---they won't bother you again."

"Thank you."
Bluster took an involuntary step back as Dockety spun around,
then glared at the bot as its mis-matched hands undid the knots
that held his arms in place.

"Come on," he said to his brother
once the other goat was free.

- Maddy's PoV
- Open with arrival in town of the mailbot Eighty-Eight Able-Six
  - One of the bots that came with Dockety, now doing package deliveries between towns
  - Gets all of the characters into the central square for background setting
- Bots arrive with Bluster and Bravo, who were caught trying to steal weapons from the bots who now live in Rusty Bridge
  - People are uncomfortable seeing anyone held/caged by the bots (too many bad memories of raids)
- Loud confrontation sets up:
  - The uneasy cohabitation ("You know they call us 'breathers'?" "Well, we call them worse.")
  - Sindy's secret lessons (she and Shaper Leaf arrive together - cover story is that she's helping him with his books because his eyes are failing)
  - The awkwardness between Maddy and Gumption (Mama Roo's gentle teasing does *not* go over well)
  - Maddy's helplessness believing that her father is alive but nobody being willing to try to save him
  - See Mouse briefly (Gumption says, "Look, you saved *it*")
- Mayor Lupus shakes her head: anything involving weapons is a matter for the Prosecutors

Sunshine meant it was morning. Morning meant Piaerre had to get out of
bed. He rubbed the grit from his eyes and rolled over, luxuriating in a
last few moments of warmth.

The gumminess in his mouth told him he had read past midnight once
again. The book responsible sat on the stool beside his low-framed bed;
the thumb-sized piece of dayglass that had been his nightlight when he
was little lay on top of it, still glowing faintly with the remains of
the previous day's sunlight.

He yawned enormously and sat up, wrapping the quilt around his
shoulders. Vaszlav would arrive soon, if he wasn't already in his usual
spot outside Mamaere Mayeule's. Piaerre groped under the quilt for his
pants and shirt and slipped them on, then slipped the book he'd borrowed
on the peddler's previous visit into his satchel and went downstairs as
quietly as he could.

"Morning," his father Laeuc said.

"Morning," Piaerre said, yawning again. His father had already been up
for an hour, carving fine curlicue details on the shaft of a bamboo
flute.

"Going up to see Vaszlav?"

"Mm." Piaerre eyed the heel of potato bread that lay forgotten on a
plate at his father's elbow. "Are you going to eat that?"

"No, go ahead." Laeuc scored a quarter circle in the flute, then held it
up and squinted at it critically. "Don't forget you have to finish the
fence today."

"I won't." Slipping the bread into his pocket, Piaerre headed out the
front door.

He stood there blinking for a moment in the sharp light of the mountain
morning. It was earlier than he'd thought---Slip Street was almost empty.
He was tempted to go back to bed, or to sit and watch his father carve,
but then he heard a rooster crow from Armaend and Donaien's yard.
Suddenly aware that he would be spending yet another afternoon indoors,
he took a deep breath. Wood smoke, the tang of pine, and a hint of
spring...

Slip Street ran the length of Starboard Town, as crooked as a dropped
piece of string. It was paved from top to bottom with rounded gray
cobblestones, each as large as Piaerre's two hands put together. Weeding
them was the bosun's favorite punishments for minor offenses. Piaerre
had pulled up more burlicks and snowdelions than most of Starboard
Town's children, usually while muttering, "But I didn't mean to," under
his breath.

Sturdy wooden railings stood guard at the street's sharp bends to catch
runaway handcarts. A pulley post stood at the top of each straight
stretch, for those times when someone needed to haul a load of firewood
or a new couch up the mountain.

The houses crowded together on either side of the street had steep
roofs, for the snows of northern winters, and large shuttered windows,
to let in the breeze during the hot southern summers. Their whitewashed
walls were spackled with brightly-painted doors, each unique: orange and
gray, blue and red, a diamond pattern of black on gold. A man-tall door
soldier made of wood and straw stood guard beside each, each in a
carefully-mended uniform whose colors matched those of the door. Every
storyteller on the mountain had a different explanation for the custom;
all anyone really knew was that they made them because their
grandparents' grandparents had.

Above the narrow street flew the town's kites, each tethered to a
chimney. The townspeople launched them when the mountain left Mau
Ngapcha, with wishes written on their bamboo cross-struts. A few had
already fallen, or been blown away by storms, but most still dipped and
swayed in the steady breeze of the mountain's northward journey.

Piaerre touched two fingers to his lips and pointed them at the blue,
orange, and yellow paper diamond holding station downwind from his
chimney. "Next year in Ensworth," he whispered. Next year in the
greatest school in the world, surrounded by books and scholars, a place
where no one thought you were strange if you knew what "loquacious"
meant...

A cream-and-chocolate goat bleated at Piaerre from a nearby rooftop,
then lowered its head to nibble the moss between its feet. Two startled
irvings fluttered away from it like leaves in a sudden hurricane,
returning a heartbeat later to peck at the goat's leavings. Hitching his
satchel's strap higher on his shoulder, Piaerre ambled up the street
toward Mamaere Mayeule's.

Vaszlav was just starting to set up when Piaerre arrived. "Clear day,
young *sra*," the old Hett tinker puffed, slipping his heavy pack off
his shoulders and touching his hairline respectfully.

"'Day, Vaszlav," Piaerre replied. "Did you find the other Farberre
book?"

"Ah, that..." Vaszlav raised and lowered his shoulders in an apologetic
shrug. "I found it, but the fellow said it wasn't for loan. Offered him
half a quarter-ring, like you said, and promised he'd get the full worth
of it if there was so much as a smudge on the back page, but he said it
was the only copy he had."

"Oh." Downcast, but also somewhat relieved that he wouldn't have to
spend a week's wages on something he would probably read in a single
evening, Piaerre watched as the old man took apart his pack's bamboo
frame with a speed born of long practice.

He turned at the sound of footsteps on the cobblestones to find a second
Hett standing behind him. "Clear day," Piaerre said politely.

The Hett nodded. "And to you." He was younger than Vaszlav---perhaps in
his twenties, or early thirties. Where the older Hett was wiry, the
newcomer looked as sturdy as a cart ox, with the top two buttons of his
shirt undone, and a sleeveless vest over top of it instead of the full
coat that Vaszlav wore no matter what weather the mountain was flying
through. His sandy hair and gray-blue eyes were as unremarkable as his
homespun clothes, but there was a stillness about him that unsettled
Piaerre.

"Ah." Vaszlav cleared his throat. "This is Jaromir, my new apprentice.
And this *sra* is Piaerre Elaiene é Laeuc, the most voracious reader on
Avaunt."

The Hett nodded. It was definitely a nod, not Vaszlav's deferential dip
of the head. "Shall I set up here?" he asked the older Hett.

"As you like," Vaszlav grunted. He handed his apprentice two pieces of
bamboo. "Here. Idiot things must have warped with the wet. See if you
can sort them out."

A small knot of people gathered while the two Hett put Vaszlav's stall
together and set out his wares, each explaining to the next who Jaromir
was. Bored, Piaerre counted the cobblestones beneath his feet. Two,
four, six... eighteen, twenty---Slip Street was twenty cobblestones wide. He
frowned, wondering suddenly how many there were on the whole street. His
papaere or the bookster would have helped him figure it out. Not the
townspeople around him, though---they would just roll their eyes and trade
amused looks with each other.

Or worse. His stomach sank as he saw Fraederiq and Niquolas coming
toward him. They had been friends of a sort when they were younger, but
then Fraederiq's mother had run off, intoxicated (some said) by the
whispered poetry of a Bantangui cinnamon merchant, and weary of her
husband's endless thirst for argument. Now sixteen, Fraederiq hadn't
just grown taller and stronger. He'd grown angry, too, angry at the
whole world. As always, Niquolas had followed suit, rolling up his
sleeves the way Fraederiq did, throwing stones when Fraederiq threw
them, and sneering at whatever stirred the older boy's displeasure that
day.

As the only other boy their age in Starboard Town, and with a head full
of odd facts, Piaerre was resigned to being their favorite target.
Lately, though, it had almost seemed as if Fraederiq was trying to be
nice to him. That worried Piaerre more than the surreptitious trippings
and knucklings he'd grown used to. He sidled behind Armaend and Donaien,
who were lost in one of their interminable arguments about cooking, but
it was too late.

"Day." Fraederiq's greeting was just a grunt.

"Day." Piaerre stuck his hands in his pockets. The less he said...

Fraederiq jerked his chin at Vaszlav's stall. "Anything better than the
usual junk this time?"

*How should I know?* Piaerre thought. *I didn't set it up.* He shrugged.
"I dunno."

Fraederiq's eyes narrowed. "Who's he?" he asked, pointing.

"Vaszlav's apprentice."

"Huh. Another newcomer. My paere says there's too many new Hett on the
mountain."

Piaerre shrugged again. Fraederiq's father, Gaeston, said many things,
few of them kind.

He was saved from having to think of another noncommittal answer by the
ringing of Vaszlav's chime. "Clear day, good morning, *mingala ba*," he
said, as he always did. "Please, good *sra*, how many I help you today?"

Piaerre cast a quick eye over the odds and ends on display. There was
nothing he hadn't seen before. As he turned to go, Fraederiq caught his
arm. He stiffened, waiting for a knuckle-twist in his ribs. Instead,
Fraederiq nodded brusquely at Vaszlav's shelves. "What do you think of
that barrette?" he asked.

"What?"

"That barrette," Fraederiq repeated impatiently. "Think it's any good?
My paere says a lot of what he sells is junk."

Bemused, Piaerre looked at the little hair clip. It didn't look like
much of anything to him, just two fingers of polished wood held together
by a bent tin spring. "Looks all right to me," he said.

"I think it's junk," Niquolas sneered.

Fraederiq silenced him with a look. "You think someone like Chaentelle
would like it?"

Piaerre blinked. "Um... I don't know," he said weakly.

Fraederiq scowled. "Come on. You've got a sister, you ought to know."

Piaerre shrugged helplessly. Yes, he had a sister, but sharing a house
with Queçenne didn't mean he knew how she *thought*, much less what her
best friend Chaentelle would and wouldn't like. "I don't know," he
repeated. "Why don't you ask her?" *Or jump off the mountain,* he added
to himself jealously. Chaentelle probably hadn't said ten words to
Piaerre since the mountain left Mau Ngapcha, but that didn't mean he
hadn't been paying attention to her. Especially on laundry days, when
steam made the old cotton shift of her mother's that she worked in cling
to her in ways that Piaerre found increasingly disturbing...

"Pfah. You're useless." Fraederiq let go of his arm and stepped around
Armaend and Donaien, who were still arguing about the best way to chop
onions when making curry. "How much is that?" he asked Vaszlav, pointing
at the barrette.

"This?" Vaszlav picked it up and handed it to Fraederiq. "It's quite the
pretty, isn't it? Thindi, not Bantangui---on my blood, that's real
mahogany. I could let you have it for, mm, three quarter rings and two
pence."

"What? For this trash?" Fraederiq scowled. "It's not worth half that.
Here." He pulled a string of coins out of his pocket, untied it, and
held out a pair of quarter-ring coins. "I'll give you half a ring for
it, how's that?"

Vaszlav spread his hands helplessly. "I am sorry, *sra*, but I cannot. I
paid three quarter rings for it myself, and---"

"What about goods in trade?" Niquolas interrupted. He elbowed Fraederiq.
"We've been doing some carving, haven't we? We figure they'll fetch half
a ring each. Give you three now, that's..." He paused, his fingers moving
against his trouser leg.

"A ring and a half," Piaerre supplied helpfully, raising his hands a
heartbeat later to fend off a double glare from the other two boys.

As Vaszlav started to reply, Jaromir stilled him with a hand on his arm.
"What kind of carvings these are?" he asked.

Niquolas glanced around. "Heads," he said conspiratorially. "For door
soldiers. We're making them out of coconut shells. They're really
scary---still have all the hair on and everything. People are going to pay
a fortune for them, you'll see."

"That's...interesting," Vaszlav said diplomatically. "Perhaps we could
take a look at some?"

Jaromir nodded, his eyes locked with Fraederiq's. "Or perhaps it would
be simpler to agree a price, and have the *sra* repay us from their
first sales? Just in case there is not so much demand as expected?"

"Hells, keep the damned thing." Fraederiq tossed the barrette at
Vaszlav. As quick as a cobra, Jaromir snatched it out of the air.
Wordlessly, he put it back in its place on the stall, then crossed his
arms once again.

Piaerre caught his breath. Around him, conversation stilled. What
Fraederiq had done had been rude, but what Jaromir had done had been a
challenge, and Hett didn't challenge Avauntois, not if they knew what
was good for them.

He glanced at Fraederiq, expecting to see the steely-eyed stare he had
been on the receiving end of so many times himself. Instead, the corner
of Fraederiq's mouth was twisted up. "Nice catch," he said. Without
another word he turned and walked away, whistling.

Piaerre's heart sank. He knew that whistle. It meant that Fraederiq had
a plan, one that involved somebody getting hurt.

* * *

Piaerre spent the rest of the morning doing chores. The bookster had
insisted---Piaerre could study with him five afternoons a week, but he had
to spend his mornings, and all of Purplesday, doing something that
didn't involve memorizing verbs or adding fractions. "*La*, a hungry
body makes a hungry mind," the bookster said cheerfully. "I favor long
walks myself, but the work of the hand is also as good."

So Piaerre stacked firewood and mended the bamboo splint fence that kept
the rabbits out of his family's vegetable garden, the morning's exchange
replaying in his mind. So what if Fraederiq wanted to give a barrette to
Chaentelle? It wasn't like she was ever going to notice Piaerre, no
matter how many times he rescued her from trolls in his daydreams. He
certainly wasn't going to make a fool of himself by trying to compete
with Fraederiq. *He* looked dashing with his hair tied back in imitation
of the bosun's. The one time Piaerre had tried it, he hadn't even made
it to the breakfast table before the smile his mother wasn't able to
conceal had sent him scurrying back upstairs to undo it.

"Ow, cake!" Piaerre swore as he hammered his thumb instead of the bamboo
stake he was supposed to be driving into the ground. Whatever Fraederiq
had in mind, it had something to do with Vaszlav and Jaromir, Piaerre
was sure of it.

As if on cue, the Hett peddler's chimes sounded. It was noon, or just
about; the Hett's bi-weekly visit Starboard Town was over. Piaerre took
his thumb out of his mouth and shook it. He'd be lucky to get more than
a boiled potato for dinner if he didn't finish the fence, but... On
impulse, he hung the hammer on the fence and squeezed into the narrow
gap between his house and the one next to it.

The sweat on Piaerre's face and arms chilled instantly in the cool
shadows. He paused a moment to let his eyes adjust, then inched toward
Slip Street with one hand on the wall beside him. If he stopped just
*here*, he could see the door of Fraederiq's house, while still being
hidden himself.

Minutes passed. A few people walked by on their way home from the
terraced beanfields that lay above and on either side of Starboard Town,
but the door didn't open. Feeling foolish, Piaerre was just about to go
back to his fence when Vaszlav and Jaromir trudged past with their packs
on their backs. A heartbeat later, the door Piaerre had been watching
opened, and Fraederiq stepped onto the street. After glancing both ways,
he set off after the two Hett.

"Great," Piaerre muttered. Now what was he going to do? Tell the bosun
that he didn't like the way Fraederiq had looked at Vaszlav? Wishing he
could whisper in someone's ear from halfway across the world, like a
magician in a story, he set off after Fraederiq.

At the top of Slip Street, the Hett turned right onto Forecastle Road.
Fifty strides behind them, Fraederiq hopped the fence into Papaere
Badette's bedraggled front garden. Piaerre's heart sank. That was the
shortcut to the upper goast pasture---Fraederiq was definitely trying to
catch up with the Hett, out of sight of the rest of the town.

"Afternoon, young bookster. Shouldn't you be up with your books?" The
booming voice made Piaerre jump guiltily.

"Afternoon, bosun." He touched his fingers to his hairline in a hurried
salute. Bosun Uyves returned it with his customary nod. "I'm, um, I'm
mending the fence."

The bosun raised his eyebrows. "Really? Looked to me like you were
standing in the middle of the street."

"Yes, bosun." Piaerre swallowed. "It's just..." *Fraederiq will kill me,*
Piaerre thought bleakly. "It's just, I think there's a problem."

If Piaerre hadn't sounded so miserable, the bosun wouldn't have believed
him. After all, this was the boy who once claimed that he'd been
kidnapped by a pack of banana trolls. But when Piaerre mentioned Jaromir
catching the thrown barrette, the bosun nodded. "Heard about that," he
grunted. "Damn cheeky of him."

"Yes, *sra*," Piaerre said, not sure whether the bosun was referring to
Fraederiq or Jaromir. He finished his story quickly.

Bosun Uyves sucked on his front teeth for a moment. "Up to the goat
pasture, eh? All right. Let's go see what's happening."

"But---"

The bosun raised a finger. Just one, but it was enough. Piaerre closed
his mouth with a snap. How did he get himself into these things?

There was an even shorter shortcut to the pasture, one that involved
scrambling up ten strides of near-vertical rock. Once at the top, the
bosun reached down, grabbed Piaerre's wrist, and pulled him up like a
sack of beans. He tapped his finger to his lips, then slipped into the
trees. With a sigh, Piaerre followed.

The dense carpet of old needles underfoot muffled their steps. Suddenly
Piaerre heard voices ahead---Vaszlav's, pleading, then Fraederiq's.
"Actually, I'm saving you money," he said. "I mean, the fine would be
what, two crowns? Maybe three? Hells, the bosun might even shackle you
for a week. Giving me that piece of trash seems cheap by comparison,
doesn't it?"

Piaerre and the bosun were close enough to hear Vaszlav clear his
throat. "If you put it that way..."

"No," Jaromir said firmly.

Piaerre gingerly moved a branch out of his way so that he could see.
Fraederiq was standing in the middle of the road with his back to the
bushes Piaerre and the bosun were hiding behind. The Hett were facing
him, their oversized packs on their shoulders. A frightened smile was
frozen on Vaszlav's face, but Jaromir's arms were crossed, and his
expression stony.

Fraederiq tsk'd. "Well then, I suppose there's nothing I can do except
go and tell the bosun."

"Tell me what?" Uyves asked, stepping onto the road. As Fraederiq
whirled around, Piaerre saw Jaromir flick his hand to toss something
into the bushes beside him.

"Clear day, bosun," Vaszlav said nervously. "We, um, we were just---"

"Tell me what?" the bosun repeated. There was no mistaking the threat in
his voice this time.

Fraederiq jerked his thumb over his shoulder at Jaromir. "He's wearing a
homestone. I saw it when they were in town."

"Did you now?" Uyves' eyes never left Fraederiq's face. "Funny you
didn't mention it then."

Fraederiq shrugged. "I just wanted to be sure."

The bosun's slap sounded like a stick being broken. Grabbing Fraederiq's
collar with his other hand, Uyves pulled him in close. "Now be sure of
this," he growled. "Taking fines is the captain's business, and no one
else's. I ever catch you doing it under your own sail, *you* will be
chopping wood until your hands bleed. Understood?"

"Understood," Fraederiq said sullenly, touching his finger to his
hairline with a not-quite-challenging carelessness.

The bosun pushed him away. "Good. Now be off with you."

"Yes, *sra*." Fraederiq saluted again. As he turned to walk away, he
shot Piaerre a look that was as cold as a dead snake's heart.

"So," the bosun said to the Hett. "What's this about a homestone?"

Jaromir shrugged without uncrossing his arms. "I am not wearing one,
*sra*." His accent was as sharp as the tang of pine sap in apple cider.

"Mm hm." The bosun beckoned him forward. "Open your shirt."

Wordlessly, the Hett undid his vest, then his shirt, and held them open.
Other than a healthy crop of chest hair, there was nothing to see.

"So where is it?" the bosun asked.

Jaromir lowered his arms and began buttoning his shirt.

"I said, where is it?" the bosun repeated sharply.

Vaszlav wrung his hands. "*Sra*, if my apprentice---"

"Quiet, old man. I'm not talking to you." The bosun cracked a knuckle.
"Hells. All right, you're not wearing one, but I don't think the boy
would have made it up out of nothing. Half a crown, or ten days, take
your pick."

Vaszlav opened his mouth to protest, but Jaromir cut him off. "As you
say, bosun. May I pay in parts?"

"Just as long as I have it before we berth," Uyves replied.

The Hett dipped his head. "As you say."

Uyves waited a heartbeak for the '*sra*' that should have followed. When
it didn't, he glanced at Vaszlav. "Pretty sure of himself, isn't he?"

The older Hett smiled nervously in apology. "He is still new to the
mountain, *sra*. He means no offense."

"Mm. Well." Uyves clapped Piaerre on the shoulder. "Anyway, good work
letting me know, lad."

"You're welcome," Piaerre mumbled. He could already feel Fraederiq's
hands around his throat...

With a final nod to the Hett, Uyves turned and began walking back along
the road to Starboard Town. As soon as he was out of earshot, Vaszlav
rounded on Jaromir angrily. What kind of idiot was he? The barrette was
nothing compared to the townspeople's goodwill, never mind the bosun's.
Had he forgotten who was the apprentice, and who was the master?

Jaromir just nodded, saying, "Yes *sra*, no *sra*," at regular
intervals. As soon as Vaszlav paused for breath, he said, "Excuse me,
*sra*," and bent over to fish his homestone out of the bushes where he'd
thrown it.

"Wonderful," Vaszlav said tiredly. "Perhaps you could have waited until
the young *sra* was not here?"

Jaromir glanced at Piaerre as he hung the homestone around his neck. It
was a flat lozenge of polished granite, half again as tall as it was
wide, with a hole drilled near the top for a cord. Many of the Hett who
had come to the mountain the past few years wore them. For luck, for
good health, because it had been their grandmother's, because all the
other Hett were doing it---there were as many explanations as there were
stones, and as many complaints about the practice as there were
Avauntois who would rather not have any Hett on the mountain at all.

As a sop to the more outspoken among them, the captain had ordered a
handful of homestones tested for magic. When none was found, he banned
them anyway, ordering a fine for a first offense, and expulsion from the
mountain for a second. *And here I am looking at one*, Piaerre thought.
He should have stuck to mending the fence.

"Don't worry," he said aloud to Vaszlav. "I won't say anything."

"Thank you, young *sra*," the Hett replied, ducking his head. "Now, if
you will excuse us? We will be two days to Forecastle with these packs."

"Sure. See you in two weeks." He raised a hand in farewell and turned
back toward Starboard Town.

* * *

Piaerre was quiet at dinner that evening, but neither his parents nor
his sister Queçenne noticed. Since the bookster had taken him on as an
apprentice, he had often been lost in his own thoughts. When he did
speak, he sounded, according to his father, "Like someone who's had his
brains stirred with a spoon."

That evening, though, his mind wasn't on verbs, or the legal rights of
Gifted animals, or any of the other insubstantial wonders that filled
his lessons. Instead, two thoughts chased each other around in his head:
whether he should tell the bosun that Jaromir actually was wearing a
homestone, and what the odds were that he'd live to see his next naming
day. Fraederiq had looked *very* angry...

Lost in thought, he barely noticed when his father set his knife and
drill aside and put the bamboo flute he'd been working on to his lips.
The gentle sound filled the house like a warm scent, or a promise that
the spring delayed by the mountain's journey north would soon be summer.
Suddenly yawning, Piaerre helped his mother Elaiene clear the table,
then trudged upstairs to bed.

Taking his little piece of dayglass from its place by the window, where
it had been soaking up the day's light, he pulled a slim cloth-bound
book from the shelf by his bed. *Acts and Questions of the Parledoux of
Avaunt* was stamped on the front, with *487* underneath in antique
Seyfertois numerals. Bosun Uyves had lent it to him the day after
receiving it from the captain in Forecastle. "Borrow the rest of them as
well, if you want," he had said, entirely unbothered by his own lack of
interest in the printed word. He knew Avaunt's laws well enough for
Starboard Town's needs, and if someone wanted to argue the details,
well, Forecastle was only a day away.

Piaerre settled himself on his bed and opened the book to the spot he
had marked the week before with a reddish-brown feather he had found in
the garden. Question 27: what should be done about the new tax the
Uwsians were charging on steel? (Pass it on to buyers.) Question 28:
what about the rabbits that plagued the mountain's beanfields? (More
traps.)

And then, Question 29: *Shall This Assembly Resolve That the Number of
Indwellers Permitted on the Mountain Outwith Berthing-Times Shall Not
Exceed Eight Hundreds?* He read it through carefully. It never mentioned
the Hett by name, but its authors left no doubt that the "indwellers"
they had in mind weren't people like Piaerre's grandfather. "Persons
most usually employed in menial trades, such as street sweepers,
nightsoil carters, peddlers, and scissor sharpeners." That was the
Hett---at least, the mountain-born Hett. They knew their place; they kept
their eyes down when the Avauntois spoke to them, and laughed when
someone made a joke at their expense. If it rankled, well, what of it?
It was no worse than the way the rest of Cherne treated their wandering
cousins.

But over the last few years, a growing number of those wanderers had
fetched up on Avaunt. Ten years ago, only a few hundred Hett had called
the flying mountain home. Now, there were a thousand. "Or more," a few
people muttered darkly. "Can't just be chance, and there can't be any
good in it."

Those mutterings had turned to arguments in Forecastle's taverns.
Finally, the captain had ordered the loudest hotheads to put the
question to the Parledoux. His chief clerk had been politely negative
after the reading, but its authors were not deterred. Fortified with a
few glasses of Enswer cider, they vowed to rewrite it, and bring it
forward again.

Until that afternoon, the debate had largely passed Piaerre by. As far
as he was concerned, the Hett consisted of the half-dozen families that
came to Starboard Town each fall to help with the charcoaling, and
tinkers like Vaszlav. The tinker's little stall, with its pins, springs,
and screws, had seemed half-magical when Piaerre was little. Later, when
he had mastered his letters well enough to read on his own, the books
that Vaszlav brought from Forecastle to rent out to Starboard Town's
inhabitants became Piaerre's salvation and refuge. They were less
important now, but he still felt that he owed the old man something. He
could only guess how many hours Vaszlav had spent badgering Forecastle's
booksellers to get them to entrust this book or that to a Hett...

Piaerre tossed and turned that night, playing out a thousand different
battles with Fraederiq in his mind. When his mother called him
downstairs for breakfast, he dragged himself out of bed, pulled on his
clothes, picked up his satchel, and mispronounced both of the Praczny
curses he knew when its twice-mended leather strap broke for the third
time.

"Well, you'll just have to ask your papaere to fix it again," Elaiene
said, stirring the beans bubbling away on the stove. "Oh, and see if he
wants to come for dinner tonight."

The early morning sun made the cobblestones gleam. Piaerre said hello to
people on his way down the street, and waved to Jaecque, who had thrown
open his bakery's shutters, but was too engrossed in the morning's
baking to wave back. One of his cats mewled at Piaerre, darting away
when he bent over to pet it. Another paused, its paw upraised, to watch
Piaerre pass by, then returned to its grooming.

Slip Street ran aground in a tangle of weeds and saplings sixty strides
further on. From there, a narrow path snaked through the corkscrew pine
forest between to the stairs that led to Piaerre's grandfather's house.
Steep shadows lay between the trees; here and there, tiny spiderwebs
glistened with dew, while overhead, a sickle-wing bat chittered
nervously.

The path ended at the edge of a near-cliff that fell away like a stone
waterfall. A man-tall bamboo crane waited there patiently, its rope
lying oiled and coiled in a plank box. As always, Piaerre took a firm
grip on one of the crane's legs and leaned out to look down, his pulse
thumping in his ears.

Lurid green creepers still covered the mountain's broad flanks below
him, though the riotous pink flowers that had bloomed on them after the
mountain's brief stay in Mau Ngapcha had fallen to pieces months ago.
The heavy plank steps half-hidden among them doubled back twice before
reaching Papaere Vurt's little cottage. Vurt had drilled holes for the
steps' spikes himself, just as he had built the little crane with his
own two hands, and fitted and nailed every board in the cottage's
verandah. It had taken him over a year, but the view made it all
worthwhile.

And what a view it was. The mountain itself ended only a hundred strides
beneath the cottage's floor. Beneath that lay empty air, a few birds,
and then, half a gallop below, the plains of eastern Darp. It was a long
way to fall...

Piaerre pulled himself back from the edge and made his way carefully
down the stairs, his satchel against his chest. He paused a moment on
the broad verandah that was his grandfather's pride and joy, then
thumped the weathered little drum hanging next to the cottage's
blue-and-orange door.

"Coming," Vurt shouted. The round mahogany peg on the end of his right
leg clunked on the floor inside. A moment later he pulled the door open.

"Morning," he said. "Wasn't expecting to see you today."

"My strap broke again." Piaerre held up his satchel.

"Damn thing. Really ought to get you a new one." His grandfather stepped
aside and waved him in.

The cottage only had two rooms. A narrow bed and a polished teak dresser
whose drawers hadn't been closed in years stood next to one wall in the
first. A silhouette portrait of Vurt's late wife hung over the bed; a
misshapen skull hung alone on the wall opposite it.

The second, larger, room served as kitchen, workshop, and (less
frequently than Piaerre's mother would have liked) bath. Dusty jars of
preserves looked down from their shelves at half-finished rabbit traps
with coiled bamboo springs and thorn teeth. An arm's length of rusty
chain, each link as big as Piaerre's hand, lay next to a cracked
hourglass whose sands had long since run out.

"Have you eaten?" Vurt asked.

"Yes, thanks," Piaerre said, his eyes watering slightly from the spices
sizzling in the battered black skillet on top of the stove.

"Good. Wouldn't be enough for the both of us."

As his grandfather gulled down his usual mix of scrambled eggs, bean
curds, dried chilis, and unripe tomatoes, Piaerre explain what had
happened the day before. Vurt frowned when he heard about the fine.
"I'd've taken the full two crowns," he said. "'Course, I'd've taken two
off your friend Fraederiq, too. Boy needs his hide striped."

"He's not my friend," Piaerre protested.

"Used to be. Niquolas, too. It's a shame they've both gone sour."

"They're not all bad," Piaerre said, with the instinctive solidarity of
youth against age. "Fraederiq does chores for Mamaere Mayeule
sometimes---and Niquolas minds Matthieu every Greensday afternoon."

"Mm hm, and gets paid for it. Now here, pass that over." Pushing aside
his skillet, he reached for his grandson's satchel.

Piaerre held it back. "Why would you have fined Jaromir at all? Those
stones aren't hurting anybody."

Vurt cleared his throat noisily. "It isn't about the stones, lad. It's
about the law. Start letting folks like this what's his name---"

"Jaromir."

"---Jaromir, start letting him think he can pick and choose which laws
he's going to obey, that'll just make 'em think there's hope for
changing things that aren't ever going to change. That Klaues fellow the
captain's so fond of has the right idea---don't try to change the rules,
just find a way to slide around them. Now, do you want me to look at
your bag or not?"

Piaerre took his books out of his satchel and passed it to his
grandfather. Vurt eyed the books sourly. "You know, it'd last longer if
you didn't load it up so much." He squinted at the stitching and clucked
his tongue. "Mm hm. It's not so bad. I can do it for you right now if
you want."

"Thanks, papaere."

"*Awshe*." He picked up his awl. "So, what happens next?"

Piaerre shrugged helplessly. "Fraederiq beats me to death with a stick?"

"Heh. Should have kept up your fencing lessons," his grandfather said
absently.

"It wasn't my idea to stop," Piaerre said defensively. When his
mother---Vurt's only daughter---had discovered that her father was teaching
Piaerre the basics of swordplay, she had put her foot down hard. Her son
was *not* going to be a rogue like his grandfather. He could learn bow
or spear for militia, like a good Avauntois, but there'd be no fencing,
and *definitely* no brawling.

Piaerre watched his grandfather work in silence, his mind on Jaromir's
homestone. Fraederiq's father Gaeston claimed that the Hett wore them as
a reminder of the fact that the mountain had once been theirs. "That's
why they ought to be banned," Gaeston had told Piaerre's father one
afternoon, not long after Question 29 had been put to the Parledoux. "If
even one of 'em thinks it's ever going to be theirs again, that's one
too many."

Piaerre couldn't remember what his father had said---something to calm
Gaeston down, most likely, or a joke to change the subject. But that
night, Piaerre's dozing dreams of Chaentelle doing laundry had been
interrupted by snatches of conversation from below. "I hear more of that
every time I go to Forecastle," Laeuc had said to Elaiene. "If the
captain doesn't do something about it, there'll be trouble when we
berth."

"Here. What do you think?" Vurt held up the satchel, breaking Piaerre's
gloomy reverie.

"It looks good. Thanks, papaere." Piaerre bit another sliver off his
much-abused thumbnail and wiped his hand on his pants. He took the
satchel and tugged on the strap. The new piece of leather felt stiff,
but would wear in quickly. "What do I owe you?"

"Gaaah." Papaere Vurt wrinkled his nose. "Clean the stove and we'll call
it a draw."

"All right." Piaerre stuck out his hand, grinning. His grandfather
pressed his palm against it with a businesslike nod. They both knew
Piaerre would have cleaned the stove anyway.

Vurt glanced at the rectangle of sunshine creeping across his battered
pine workbench. "You'd best be going."

"Yeah. Thanks again." Piaerre slipped his books back into the bag. There
were only six of them, but that was six more than most people in
Starboard Town read in a year.

He turned to go, then stopped himself. "Oh, I almost forgot---maere wants
to know, are you coming up for dinner tonight?"

Vurt shrugged. "Wasn't planning to. Plenty here I should use before it
goes off." Which was a lie, and they both knew it. "'Sides, I feel like
a gull, nipping off your plates."

Piaerre rolled his eyes. "You're not being a gull. And if you don't
come, maere'll spend the whole meal worrying about you, and then she'll
be down here tomorrow with a new pair of mittens and a basket full of
biscuits."

"Oh, *saad*, she hasn't gone and knit some more, has she?"

"Of course not. She baked them." He pretended to duck as his grandfather
growled and raised a fist. "But if you don't come, she'll probably make
you longjohns as well." He tried to leer. "You could always stop off at
Mamaere Mayeule's on the way back."

"Oh, could I now? Awful kind of you to give me permission."

Piaerre grinned and slung his satchel over his shoulder. "Anyway, I have
to go."

"All right." Vurt took his cane from the tool rack beside his workbench
and followed his grandson out onto the verandah. There, grandfather and
grandson paused a moment to admire the view.

Avaunt was still over the chaparral of eastern Darp, as it had been, and
would be, for weeks. Gray-green shrubs lay on the dry, red earth like
tufts of stained wool. Thin streams glistened between them at the bottom
of rocky, steep-sided gullies. A gallop away, a pair of giant stone
hands, weather but unbroken and six stories tall, reached toward the sky
as they had done since the time of the Uncertain Angels. No one knew
whether they were pleading, or waiting to catch a star that had yet to
fall; no one knew whether they were part of a buried giant, a side
effect of some spell wrought during the great war in which the Angels
had destroyed themselves, or merely some eccentric work of art. And
other than Piaerre, no one in Starboard Town much cared. The Angels had
fallen, the world carried on---if it wasn't disturbing the goats or the
beans, best to leave it be.

"See over there?" Piaerre said suddenly, pointing. "Horses."

"Good eyes," Vurt said, fishing his glasses out from under his shirt and
holding them up in front of his face. If there had been anyone else
there, he would have grunted and changed the topic, rather than
admitting that he could no longer see clearly at that distance. "You
think they're wild?"

Piaerre studied them for a moment. "Maybe," he said hesitantly. "I don't
know."

Vurt shook his head and pointed. "You're not looking. See back that way?
Next to the hands?" He waited until his grandson nodded. Two dismounted
riders lay in the shade with their heads on their saddles. "Probably
taking them to market. Coriandel, maybe, or Armaq." He tucked his
glasses back under his rough linen shirt. "You should get up to your
lessons."

"I suppose." Piaerre looked longingly at the world rolling by beneath
them. Four months ago, the land beneath the flying mountain had been
carpeted with dense green jungle. They had seen flocks of white-winged
birds take flight at dawn, and a herd of hippos stampede for safety when
a crocodile attacked. There had been villages, too, with tendrils of
smoke rising from the thatched roofs of their longhouses.

The jungle had given way to grassland as the mountain flew north, which
in turn had given way to the windblown grit of the Karaband Desert.
Piaerre and his grandfather had slung hammocks on the verandah then, and
slept under the stars. Piaerre's parents and sister joined them a few
times for dinner, and a few other townspeople came down as well to see
what there was to be seen, or keep Vurt up to date with the mountain's
gossip, or just to sit in silence and listen to the steady breeze of the
mountain's stately flight.

Most often, though, Piaerre and Vurt had the verandah to themselves. The
old man listened to his grandson describe what he had learned in his
lessons that day, telling him stories about life on the ground below in
return. They shared breaded dates that Piaerre bought from Mamaere
Mayeule on Redsday and Greensday mornings, and if one or the other
closed his eyes and breathed a little easier now and again, well, what
of it? No one fussed over Vurt, or asked him if he wanted yet another
cup of tea. No one bullied Piaerre, or made fun of all the words he
knew. They were both content, though only Vurt knew enough to know how
rare such contentment was.

A week ago, the flying mountain's shadow had crossed the River Wise,
which marked the halfway point of the mountain's journey from Mau
Ngapcha to Normous Berth. When they reached their northern destination,
the mountain's people would have two weeks to earn their livings. Silk,
mahogany, chocolate, nutmeg, mace, and cloves would come out of storage,
and be replaced by steel, wool, cider, and leather. And while Piaerre's
parents still claimed that they hadn't made up their minds, Vurt and
Piaerre both knew that Piaerre would leave the mountain then. The
hundreds of old books in the Captain's House, and the eclectic lessons
of a single eccentric bookster, were not enough. Piaerre was sixteen; if
he wanted to become a bookster himself, he had to leave the mountain and
find schooling elsewhere.

Vurt put his hand on his grandson's shoulder and shook him gently. "Well
then, off with you. Tell your mother I'll be there for dinner, if you
like."

"I will."

As Piaerre turned to go, his grandfather said, "Piaerre? You did the
right thing talking to the bosun."

Piaerre forced a smile. "Bet you Fraederiq doesn't think so."

His grandfather frowned. "Don't suppose he does. You watch out for him,
all right? He's trouble."

"I'll be careful," Piaerre promised. He forced a smile as Vurt squeezed
his shoulder, then started up the stairs.

* * *

Piaerre was breathing hard by the time he reached the path back to town.
His papaere had the best view on this side of the mountain, but you had
to work to enjoy it.

He fingered the patch on his satchel strap as he scanned the trees.
There was no sign of Fraederiq, but that didn't mean anything. Boys in
Starboard Town started hunting the rabbits that infested the mountain as
soon as they were old enough to hold a sling, and the trick to getting
close enough to use one was knowing how to hide...

Piaerre wiped his hands on his heavy cotton trousers and set off briskly
through the braided pines. "*Gangre*," he muttered, trying to distract
himself. "To walk. *Forløpre*. To run..." His teacher, Razi, had started
teaching him Praczny a week before. It was harder than Seyfertois, which
was practically the same as what was spoken on the mountain, or Enswer,
which was the most common language in Normous Berth, but the bookster
said the effort would be good exercise for his mind. "*Klatre*, to
climb. *Kjøpre*, to buy. *Selgre*, to sell..."

Piaerre hurried along the path, suddenly aware that he was going to be
late for his lesson. He jumped as a macaw squawked at him from a branch
overhead, instantly angry at the way it made his heart pound. Stooping,
he picked up a stone and threw it at the brightly colored bird. "Go
home," he said loudly. The macaw squawked again and flapped away,
wondering in its little bird mind why the trees smelled so wrong, and
why the nights were so cold. A few jungle creatures were always marooned
when the mountain left Mau Ngapcha. Sometimes the townspeople caught
them and sold them as pets or delicacies at Normous Berth. More often,
though, they starved, or froze to death in the next northern winter.

Piaerre heaved a sigh of relief when he reached Slip Street without
being ambushed. It was almost noon; most people were stringing beans and
weeding potatoes in the terraced fields on either side of town. He waved
hello to the few who weren't, but didn't stop to chat.

The Captain's House watched over Starboard Town from the top of Slip
Street like a stern old shepherd watching her flock. The old captain had
still been living there when Piaerre was born. After his death, it had
been empty between the new captain's annual visits, until Razi had
arrived to catalog the eclectic collection of old books and yellowing
papers that filled its lower floor.

That morning, the walled garden in front of the house was a riot of
purple and orange flowers. Bees buzzed back and forth among them in busy
ecstasy. Piaerre paused at its front gate---the only iron gate in
Starboard Town---to catch his breath. As he reached for the latch, a meaty
fist struck the side of his head.

He yelped, staggering under the blow. Strong hands grabbed his jacket
and pulled him into the shadowed alley next to the garden wall.

Piaerre oophed as Fraederiq slammed him against the stone wall. "You
little slug," he hissed, his face so close that Piaerre could feel the
warmth of his breath. "Who the hells do you think you are? Eh? You think
you're better than the rest of us because of all that cake you read?"

"Let go of me!" Piaerre struggled helplessly. Fraederiq jerked Piaerre
toward him and slammed him back into the wall.

"Didn't anyone ever tell you to mind your own business?" Fraederiq
twisted Piaerre's collar tight with his left hand and punched him in the
ribs with his right. "Eh? Didn't anyone... ever... tell you... not... to stick...
your nose... where it doesn... belong?" Fresh blows punctuated the sentence.

"Let me go! Let me go or I'll tell!" Piaerre threw a desperate punch of
his own. He was as surprised as Fraederiq when it grazed the older boy's
cheek.

Fraederiq caught Piaerre's wrist and drove Piaerre's hand into his own
face. "Ow! Oh, stop, Piaerre! Stop, please, you'll hurt yourself!" Again
and again Fraederiq punched Piaerre in the face with his own fist. Hot
tears stung Piaerre's eyes. He opened his mouth to yell for help.

And at that moment, without warning, the mountain lurched beneath them.

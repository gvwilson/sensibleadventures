<p align="center"><em>For Madeleine, who is taking me on the greatest journey of my life.</em></p>
<p><em>Consider Cherne. A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight thousand gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to west. Its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to cradle that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well. Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a war that scarred the moon and turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass. When it was over the Pilots were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.</em></p>
<p><em>Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms. it is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot, 1272, and a girl who is no longer a child but not quite yet a woman is crouched on a cloud, chilled to teh bone but willing him to fly faster...</em></p>
<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; Grappa Gas bellowed. &quot;It's going to get bumpy!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy dropped to one knee, pulled the glove off her left hand, and pressed her palm against the cloud beneath her. She mind-heard Big Blue's determination, but the cloud was old, older even than Grappa Gas, and they were flying straight into a headwind.</p>
<p><em>Faster!</em> she urged. <em>Please, faster!</em> She shivered despite her yakskin hat and coat, her hand already numbed by the icy mountain air.</p>
<p>Up ahead, a makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose like an island out of the forest. A dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire. Shading her eyes with her right hand, Noxy saw that the soldiers had formed a circle around it. Some had swords in their hands, while others held spears or bows. Big Blue's mate Pillow was floating above them, her sides rippling as she struggled to keep station in the wind, but the soldiers weren't looking at the clouds. They were looking at the trees around them, waiting for the coming attack.</p>
<p>&quot;You're coming in too low!&quot; Granna Fee yelled. Noxy's grandmother lay full length on Big Blue, propped up on her elbows with a pair of binoculars in her hands. &quot;Level him off!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no time!&quot; Grappa Gas yelled back, his red-and-yellow scarf flapping madly behind him. &quot;We have to dumble!&quot; The old man closed his eyes. His lips moved as he mind-spoke commands to the cloud beneath him. Noxy mind-heard the old bull protest, but even as he grumbled he bunched up and went into a steep dive.</p>
<p>Noxy had just a moment to think, <em>I'd be grounded for a month if I did something like this,</em> and then the cloud thudded against the side of the peak like a sack full of wet wool. Nox yelped and sprawled forward to land in an untidy heap beside Granna Fee. &quot;Sorry!&quot; she said, but her grandmother was already up, swaying to keep her balance as the cloud scraped across bare rock, flattened two tents, and came to a halt.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you waiting for!?&quot; Granna Fee shouted at the soldiers, sliding down Big Blue's flank and waving her arm as if to sweep them all onto the cloud. &quot;Get on! Get on!&quot;</p>
<p>As Noxy scrambled to her feet, Grappa Gas caught her arm. &quot;Stay here---I'll help them up.&quot; Without waiting for her to answer he stumped forward, his peg leg leaving dimples in the cloud. &quot;And keep an eye on the forest!&quot; he added over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced back just in time to see something brown flash between two trees below them. Another half-seen shape followed it. She gulped. The forest was mustering. It was only a matter of time before---</p>
<p>Without warning a brown bear charged out of the trees and and reared up on its hind legs. Another bear joined it, then a cougar, and then---</p>
<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Noxy said under her breath. There were trolls in the trees, a dozen, two, three, a whole troop of them. Hooting and barking, they shook the branches until it looked like the entire forest had come alive.</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa! Grappa!&quot; she shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;I see 'em!&quot; the old man shouted back. With a grunt, he clasped hands with the first of the soldiers and helped him scramble up onto the cloud. A second soldier tossed his spear aside and pulled himself up. Together, the two men reached back and hauled up a third while Grappa Gas reached for a fourth.</p>
<p>But instead of grabbing the cloudherd's hand, the man on the ground lifted a heavy canvas-wrapped bundle. &quot;Never mind that, get yourself up here!&quot; Grappa Gas ordered.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not leaving them!&quot; the man on the ground yelled back. One of the soldiers already on the cloud shouldered Grappa Gas aside, grabbed a corner of the canvas, and tried to haul it up. His legs sank halfway to his knees with the weight.</p>
<p>Noxy felt Big Blue shudder underneath her. She dropped to her knees and pressed her hand against the cloud once again. <em>Just a little longer,</em> she pleaded, trying to squelch her fear so that he couldn't mind-hear it. <em>Just a little longer.</em></p>
<p>All at once the trolls stopped hooting. The bears dropped to all fours and lumbered back into the forest. The cougar snarled, its fur bristling, and bounded after them. She heard a shrill warning whistle from the cloudherds circling above them, high-high-low, high-high-low. Fear glooped in her belly as if she had swallowed a bowl full of cold porridge. &quot;Grappa---&quot; she started.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard it!&quot; he yelled. Cursing, he helped another soldier onto the cloud. Half a dozen of the canvas-wrapped bundles lay together in a pile surrounded by twice that many men. &quot;Spread yourselves out! Come on, Fee, we gotta go!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's grandmother clambered up Big Blue's flank. &quot;Now or never!&quot; she yelled at the last soldier. He sheathed his sword and grabbed a handful of cloud just as the squirrels burst out of the forest in an angry swarm.</p>
<p><em>Up!</em> Noxy mind-yelled at Big Blue. The cloud surged into the air, throwing the soldiers off balance. As they toppled over she heard Grappa Gas shout, &quot;Hold on!&quot;</p>
<p>The last soldier clung desperately to Big Blue's flank as the cloud squished in his grasp like soggy dough. Chirping furiously, the squirrels jumped at his legs. The soldier cursed as one managed to catch hold of his boot, scramble up the laces, and sink its teeth into his calf. He kicked it off, lunged for Grappa Gas's hand, and collapsed onto the cloud a moment later, his chest heaving.</p>
<p>&quot;You idiot!&quot; Grappa Gas yelled at him. &quot;You saints-be-damned <em>idiot</em>! They woulda stripped you down to your bones faster'n you can peel an apple! What was so weeping important that you couldn't just leave it?&quot; He kicked one of the bundles at his feet. &quot;Eh? What was so---urp!&quot;</p>
<p>In one smooth motion the soldier had rolled onto his feet, stood up, and grabbed a handful of Grappa Gas's coat. &quot;With respect, honored, that's one of my men you're kicking. I'm grateful for the rescue, but I'm going to have to ask you to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>He let go of Grappa Gas's collar. The cloudherd coughed. &quot;Ah. Sorry, lad. I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier nodded. &quot;Me too.&quot; He looked back at the patch of rock, where the forest's squirrels were tearing every man-made thing to pieces. &quot;Me too.&quot;</p>

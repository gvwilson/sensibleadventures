        *   "In the *tralpa*'s absence..."
    *   Dorbu says they'll go as soon as they can, but right now they need help recovering their wounded

        *   Challenging Gas and others: "We don't take sides, but we don't leave people to die either"

    *   Noxy asks her mother to let her and her friends go
    *   Is introduced to Dorbu, Kulbinder, and Thokmay (Indy: "And this is the tiger's boy... um...")
        *   First up-close description of Thokmay and his scars
        *   And of Kulbinder's watchful menace
    *   Noxy marshals arguments, is surprised when her mother agrees so quickly
        *   Serves as character development: Noxy is used to being in charge of things
    *   Gather at the cloudherding pen (teens have strict orders to help, not get involved)
    *   See how cloudherding works
        *   In particular, that cloudherds have to touch clouds to mind-speak with them
        *   Noxy gets her first twinge
        *   Makes her speak sharply to Rash and Sensy (bossing them around)
    *   Getting under way

        *   Grappa Gas thinks he sees someone
        *   Noxy's excited, then disappointed when it's only a troll
        *   Tells Gas and Fee about seeing a troll earlier that morning (keep it in the reader's mind)
    *   Arrival at the soldiers' makeshift camp
        *   There are more of them than Dorbu had led the villagers to believe
    *   Rescue
        *   Growing urgency as the clouds load up one by one
            *   Aft gives orders, Noxy repeats them, Rash says, "I heard" (again, growing resentment of Noxy's bossiness)
        *   Hard to tell what the forest will allow and what it won't
        *   But animals gathering
        *   One soldier takes a brand from the fire to scare them off
        *   Gas slingshots it out of his hands (foreshadow Gas's slingshot)
        *   But the animals charge (bears, cougars, trolls)
            *   Make the animals strange: the bears have glowing stripes
        *   Dorbu is the last one out, helping another soldier
    *   Flying home
        *   Gas rounds on Dorbu: "What in all the rotting hells was so important that you couldn't leave it behind?"
        *   Bonzon answers: "Our fallen.  Those we could recover."
        *   Description of Bonzon
        *   Bonzon: "We'll return in the spring to lay the ghosts of those we couldn't."
            *   The way he said it made it a simple statement of fact, like "Water flows downhill" or "The sun rises in the morning."

## Chapter 3. Tension at Home

*   goals    
    *   Bonzon vs. Dorbu
        *   Bonzon wants to order the Stalers around (but is initially too weak to do so)
        *   Dorbu wants to persuade them and work around their needs
    *   Noxy losing control
        *   Noxy is used to being the boss (and is afraid of losing her friends as they grow closer)
        *   Sensy and Rash are beginning to rebel (in part because they are now more interested in each other)
        *   Noxy's growing power feels like loss of control
        *   Realizes with a shock that she's mind-speaking to clouds without touching them
        *   Then tries to convince herself that she's mistaken, because if she's right...
    *   villagers amongst themselves (e.g. Indy vs. Grappa Gas and Granna Fee)
        *   Fee: "They can't stay, daffodil.  They can't."
        *   Fee's argument (we can't take sides) is different from Gas's (they're the wrong side)
        *   Indy: "We can't kick them out - we'd be killing them." and "And we *can't* kick them out.  They're soldiers, we're not."
        *   So this is also Indy vs. the burden of responsibility
    *   Grappa Gas vs. Aft
        *   they have always squabbled
            *   Aft's mother used to mediate
            *   She died of the scribbles (foreshadow Noxy's revelation about her dad)
            *   Dorbu: "Seem to be a lot of broken families here."
            *   Indy (sharply): "We don't think of ourselves as broken." (pause) "But cloudherding is a hard life."
            *   Dorbu (conciliatory): "I can only guess.  They do seem to fight a lot, though."
            *   Indy (smiling to take out the sting): "This from a man who's fighting a civil war?"
        *   Grappa Gas likes things the way they are - would rather fix the fishpond than save the world
        *   Aft wants things to change
            *   Would have gone off to explore the world if his mother hadn't been sick
            *   Never quite got around to it
            *   Shows unexpected vulnerability when talking to the soldiers about the world they've seen
    *   keep the trolls in the picture
    *   more hints about Noxy's powers
    *   Thokmay hiding his face from Bonzon
*   details
    *   Fly back to Stale with the wounded and the dead
        *   Bonzon giving crisp, unforgiving orders to Dorbu
            *   Bonzon wants patrols out right away, Dorbu wants to give the soldiers a rest
        *   Rash makes a crack about knowing how it feels to be ordered around
        *   Bonzon glancing at cloudherds, clearly deciding *not* to say some things
    *   Arrive in Stale
        *   Soldiers offload the dead
        *   Noxy is soothing the cloud
        *   After she gets off, she thinks, "Really sorry you had to carry them."
        *   Thinks she hears the cloud reply, "It's all right."
        *   So shocked that she stumbles, but then convinces herself she was imagining it
    *   Back to the main square where Indy is re-organizing the villagers
        *   Has put on her blue-and-white jacket (her favorite colors, sky and snow)
        *   Was halfway through getting things set up when the first cloud arrived with news of how many soldiers
        *   She's ordering villagers to re-do work
        *   Sparks an argument between Grappa Gas and Aft about whether they should be here at all
            *   Gas: "We shouldn't be setting up for a long stay"
            *   Aft: "You're not the mayor any more, she is"
            *   Indy: "Stow it, both of you!"
        *   Dorbu's comments
    *   Thokmay reports to Dorbu wearing his battle mask (Bonzon is nearby)
        *   Dorbu: "Why are you masked?"
        *   Thokmay (woodenly, half-muffled by the mask): "I was moving too slowly on the stairs, honored."
        *   Dorbu: "I'm going to have a word with that tiger about how hard he pushes you."
        *   Thokmay: "I would be grateful if you did not, honored."
        *   Dorbu (shaking head as Thokmay leaves): "Pushes himself too hard, that one.  And Kulbinder pushes him even harder sometimes."
        *   Bonzon (frowning): "An orphan?"
        *   Dorbu: "Yes, honored.  Came to us just a few months before the rebellion."
        *   Bonzon tells Dorbu they need to have a discussion away from prying ears
        *   Figure out later Thokmay is hiding his face from Bonzon
    *   Conversations at home
        *   Indy has Noxy make tea
        *   Gas shows up first: "We're being overrun! We have to do something!"
            *   Takes out his knitting
            *   Gas takes something eye-watering out of his pocket and puts it in his tea (lighten up the story)
            *   Indy and Noxy groan
            *   Noxy makes an excuse and escapes upstairs for a moment to get away from the smell

        *   Fee shows up next: "They can't stay, daffodil."
            *   Mention Duck Droppings: "What would the other villages think?"
        *   Filler
            *   Cloudherds have argued about supporting the rebellion (or the king) before
            *   Decision was to stay out of lowland wars
        *   Everyone's calming down when there's a crash and a yowl outside
            *   Noxy is the first one out the door
            *   Kulbinder is chasing a troll
            *   Leaps for it, is blocked by another
            *   A trio scampers away
            *   Noxy recognizes the one that she saw that morning
        *   Conversation
            *   A troll had been spying on the villagers
            *   Reveal that trolls are chimpanzees
            *   Grappa Gas: "What's a troll doing this close to the village?"
            *   Reveal that the village has a deal with the trolls
            *   Thokmay comes panting up

        *   She asks if he enjoyed his breakfast (awkward attempt to make conversation)
        *   Thokmay: "Yes." (glance at Dorbu, then repeats) "I particularly liked the peppers."

    *   Noxy covers her discomfort by talking too much

            *   Noxy thinks, "That never happens!"
        *   Sensy (changing subject): "Anyway, Grappa Gas is taking him up for a ride"

            *   Face drawn and feverish
            *   "Thokmay's fallen in the pond and Kulbider's gone in after him and they're going to freeze now let me *go*!"

        *   Everyone starts walking back to the village
            *   Indy, Aft, and Granna Fee meet them part-way

            *   The soldiers head back to strip and sauna
            *   Corporal Choegyal (still shivering): "We'd been meaning to try out your sauna..."
            *   Indy: "If you weren't freezing, I'd ask you what you were doing when we agreed there'd be no patrols."

            *   Indy (sternly): "We'll talk about this over a cup of tea."
            *   Gas (protesting): "But---"
            *   Indy: "Tea!  Now!"  (Makes it sound like a prison sentence.)
        *   Back to Indy's house
            *   Aft and Grappa Gas go in, Indy brittly asks Fee to look after Noxy

            *   Fee: "Your father said he could only make one."
            *   Noxy: "What did he trade?"
            *   Fee (shaking head): "He didn't say.  It's not the sort of thing you ask a magician."
            *   She tells the story of how Ulfmaerr discovered he had magic
            *   Bargained with a passing whale by accident
            *   Noxy (hesitantly): "Do you think I might be a magician some day?"
            *   Granna Fee (starts to smile, then realizes Noxy is serious): "Maybe.  But nobody and nothing can *make* you a magician.  You have to choose."

        *   Noxy: "But if you can tell where they fought..."

        *   Granna Fee: "She's old enough... and she might need to know"

        *   Thokmay restrains him with a hand gesture: "You'll what? Tell the sergeant?  Or the colonel?"
        *   Noxy: "Do you think they wouldn't believe me?"
        *   Kulbinder: "Bonzon would.  And then he'd turn me into a rug."
        *   Kulbinder: magicians aren't the only ones who trade parts of themselves - Bonzon's done it for the revolution
        *   Thokmay (quietly): "Besides, if you turn us in, who's going to save your village?"
        *   Noxy: "What?"
        *   Thokmay: "They didn't come looking for us.  They're here to take over your clouds to use as weapons."
        *   Noxy is aghast: "But they can't!  The other kingdoms wouldn't allow it!"
        *   Kulbinder: "They're not just rebelling against one king - they've realized they have to rebel against all of them."
        *   Noxy: "We won't! We'll just fly away!"
        *   Thokmay: "And leave all the children behind?"
        *   to Noxy's stunned silence: "Why do you think he's turning the traders' hall into a jail?"
    *   her anger boils over
        *   rage makes her kick the parapet over and over
        *   stops when Kulbinder snarls at her
        *   realizes that Thokmay has drawn his sword
        *   half a dozen trolls are in the trees near the walls, shaking the branches and hooting
        *   they fall silent when she does, then disappear back into the forest
        *   Thokmay: "How did you do that?"
        *   Noxy (on the verge of tears): "I don't know."
        *   Kulbinder: "That can wait.  We need to get to the Fifth."
    *   Little Gas comes up the stairs (echo of the opening scene)

        *   Thokmay (quietly, to Noxy): "We don't have time"
        *   Noxy wonders for a moment when there was time, what she missed, when it could have been different
        *   then wipes angry tears from her eyes: "Come on."

        *   magic has a price
    *   cloud chase
        *   Big Blue gets closer

            *   Noxy: "Traitor!"
            *   Dorbu: "Please!  Noxy... Kulbinder... we don't want to hurt anyone!"

        *   Pillow is getting more tired by the minute flying upwind
        *   Aft: "Don't make us do this the hard way!"
    *   Linger (through Ulfmaerr) tells them they should go the opposite direction from the way they're flying
        *   head for the deep forest where humans are never allowed
    *   Noxy reaches with her mind and finds a cloud from the night before
        *   separated from its herd
            *   tired himself out dueling with bigger bulls using lightnings

        *   takes Pillow around a spur of rock, rests for a minute
        *   raises the cloud wall higher to blend in against the snow
        *   tells everyone to be quiet
        *   waits, waits... feels Big Blue going past
        *   now!

        *   but the ache in her muscles won't let her pretend
        *   lies there for a moment thinking about a world where Dorbu is dead and Bonzon is alive
        *   then about one where all the village children are free and Bonzon is in prison
    *   walks through town to check in on Kulbinder and Thokmay
        *   sees Choegyal in the door of the traders' hall, but doesn't acknowledge him
    *   Kulbinder is sleeping, but healing
        *   she talks to Thokmay
        *   Ulfmaerr has gone
        *   Thokmay is sorry - he wanted to say goodbye
        *   brings home to Noxy that it's over
    *   Noxy: "Have you thought about what you're going to tell your father?"
        *   Thokmay: "The truth, I suppose - some good men died."
        *   Noxy: "Not what I meant."
    *   Thokmay asks if Noxy has told anyone about her power or the forest's offer
        *   Noxy: "No. I think Granna Fee, but not all of it."
    *   Silence for a moment, then Thokmay tentatively asks if she'd like to learn how to juggle
        *   Noxy squeezes his hand: "Sure"
        *   they go downstairs
    *   end with two paragraphs in present tense italics, like the opening
        *   "Look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise..."
        *   just over the horizon, not yet seen, a herd of clouds is on its way home
        *   there, behind old stone walls, a boy and a girl are playing together
        *   they are not children any longer, not really, and they have been hurt, but they will heal
        *   their world has changed forever, but everyone's does, every day - all any of us can do is ride out our storms and look for clear skies beyond
        *   and one day - ah, but that is a story for another time

------------------------------------------------------------

To Do:

*   **have them circle back to the village right after fleeing and see stuff that shows how bad Bonzon is and the situation Aft is in**

*   show Kulbinder encouraging Thokmay in early chapters so that his encouragement of Noxy will make sense
*   show Noxy's collection of knitted dolls (made by her father)
    *   makes sense if we see Grappa Gas and Aft knitting (it's man's work)
*   need more flashbacks and fill-ins before the last two chapters (so the ones there don't come as a surprise)
*   have to solve it *before* the adults get back, because they'll give in

*   What's the point of this story?
    *   It's an adventure
    *   It introduces a new world for more stories
    *   Its heroine is someone Maddie can relate to
    *   So it has to be fun to read (like the books she's reading now)
    *   NOT TOO SERIOUS
    *   Characters need to be slight exaggerations/caricatures (except for Noxy and Thokmay)

*   Ulfmaerr makes a sacrifice for the village
*   Noxy realizes that if she throws away her power, she loses the power to fix what's broken in the world
    *   "Great power brings with it a great obligation."

*   Make Bonzon the villain
    *   He gave away self-doubt for magic

*   Thokmay's mask is a metaphor

*   get rid of Snakes and Whistles

*   Theme: choices
    *   Ulfmaerr chose to make a bargain with the forest in order to save the village
        *   Noxy has hated him for it for years, but finally accepts it
        *   Hugs him: he's surprised and says, "I don't know what I've done to deserve this," and she whispers, "But I do."
        *   Ulfmaerr has joined the forest
            * magic comes from making deals with magical things like the forest or the dragon
            * he made a deal to save the village from the scribbles
            * Noxy: "He still wears clothes and cooks his food - at least, he did the last time anyone saw him - but he's wilder every year."
    *   Noxy has to choose whether or not to make a bargain with the forest as well
        *   She's shocked and frightened when she realizes she can mind-speak to clouds from a distance
        *   Reader doesn't initially understand her fear
        *   Then she talks to Granna Fee about what's happening, and we see Granna is frightened as well
        *   Fee: "Can't tell your mother - she couldn't bear to lose you to the forest too"
        *   Noxy: "But is that what it is?"
        *   Fee (darkly): "Let's not take a chance"
        *   So Noxy tries to hold off using her power until they escape
        *   Noxy also has to choose whether or not to let Rash and Sensy be together and still be their friend
            * this one is aimed straight at Maddie...
    *   Dorbu has to choose whether or not to go along with Bonzon
        *   He believes in Shudarga's cause
        *   Early on, he has a discussion in Indy's kitchen while Noxy listens from upstairs
            * Indy: "Is it worth killing for?"
            * Dorbu (steadily): "I believe it's worthy my life.  And if it's worth mine, it's worth others."
        *   Later, after Bonzon locks down the village, he tries to talk to Indy again, but she pushes him away
            * "Are you saying this because you believe it or because you want me to like you?  Because if you want me to like you, *do* something."
            * Noxy comes down and hugs her mother, who cries because she likes Dorbu and doesn't want to get hurt again by someone doing things for principle

*   Rash wasn't hurt: Aft was
    *   Don't mention a child

*   Without Shudarga, what finally gives Thokmay away?

*   Get rid of Tasteless entirely: Bonzon is one of the wounded
    *   Bonzon is a magician: traded caring about right and wrong for a spell long ago
        *   Whispered: "someone said he traded with the dragon" (equivalent of dark magic)
        *   He chooses to do whatever is necessary, and thinks that people who won't are hypocrites
    *   Bonzon is unconscious when the soldiers are rescued
        *   wakes up and heals himself
        *   a common battle magic
        *   the price is ever feeling at peace
        *   even Sensy knows that one
    *   Uses the capture of the two royalist rangers as an excuse to lock down the village
        *   Use it as a fortress to block the pass to Chaghan so that the royalists can't be reinforced
            * Implies that the rebellion is going well enough to frighten other kingdoms
            * Bonzon never believed they'd win: have to play a long game
        *   There's no way to get to Stale in numbers except by cloudback
            * The rescue wasn't a planned attack, but Bonzon would be a fool not to take advantage of it
            * Indy: "You mean of *us*."
            * Indy: "As soon as the pass opens, the king will send an army after you!"
            * Shudarga (calmly): "Yes - and as soon as he does that, you will flood the pass and drown them."

*   cut Dragger out of this entirely
    *   trolls show up and threaten the trio when they're at Ulfmaerr's cabin
    *   just as they decide to make a dash for the cloud, the trolls disappear (ordered away by Ulfmaerr)
    *   get rid of Redclaw unless she can bring news of Stale (!)
*   Ulfmaerr says he can't help
    *   when Noxy protests, he clarifies: he can't, but the forest might if someone can strike a bargain
    *   so they have to go into the deep forest

*   The trio brings Dorbu along as a prisoner
    *   Grabs Noxy as the trio are making their escape
    *   Knocked over the side onto the cloud by Kulbinder
    *   Thokmay holds a sword at his throat until he surrenders
        *   Dorbu: "I don't believe you'll do that"
        *   Thokmay: "I didn't believe you would use children as weapons"

*   Ulfmaerr can't help, but the forest can
    *   Ulfmaerr can make introductions
    *   He doesn't ever speak directly to Noxy
        *   Thokmay: "Why is he mad at you?"
        *   Noxy (bitterly): "He's not.  It's a spell price."
        *   Thokmay: "Then why are you mad at him?"
        *   Noxy blows up, and we see how much her father's choice hurt her

*   How does it end?
    *   Conversation with the forest
        *   Get rid of Linger and Dragger, just speak directly with the trees
        *   Keep the cozy house scene
        *   Noxy is offered a choice, but it's not complete or irrevocable
        *   she has to take every step, and can stop whenever she wants
        *   Noxy: "Just like my father stopped?"
        *   Forest (calmly): "The one thing no one can ever trade away is choice."
        *   Noxy: "So what do I have to trade away to get your help?"
        *   Forest: "Being able to shut me out."
    *   Before Noxy can do it, she's shaken awake: another cloud has found them
        *   It's Bonzon and some archers on Big Blue, steered by Aft
        *   He berates Noxy and pleads with her to come back
            * Grappa Gas was hurt during her escape
            * Aft is angry and frightened
        *   The two clouds butt up against each other
        *   Dorbu charges across and takes Bonzon with him over the side
            * As the two clouds are getting closer he makes a quiet speech
            * "Please tell your mother I'm not doing this for her.  I'm doing it to save the revolution."

*   Say somewhere that doing the right thing is a lot harder when you don't know what it is

*   Leave Shudarga out of this: it's Colonel Bonzon who arrives
    *   "People follow Shudarga because they love her. They obey Bonzon because they're afraid not to."

*   skip the lightnings: it's the forest that helps (reduce the number of variables)

*   make it really clear that Grappa Gas is a royalist and Aft is a rebel sympathizer
*   Princess Shudarga isn't a princess: call her Honored Shudarga
*   What sways the initial argument is the "no one left behind" argument
    *   Which turns out to be what Tasteless did
*   Tasteless has been shunned by his village for leaving someone behind
    *   Include a scene where he tries to talk to Noxy - he's lonely - but even she knows to ignore him.
*   Shudarga was apprenticed to a family of booksters who defended the poor.
    *   This is how we introduce the idea of royalty apprenticing in secret.
*   Get rid of the old lady of the forest.
    *   Noxy talks directly to Linger when everyone else is asleep.
    *   Realizes that she's not really talking to him - she's talking through him to the forest.
*   Throw away most of what happens after they leave Ulfmaerr's cottage.
    *   It feels like filler.
    *   The book will be as long as it is.
*   ?? When and how to introduce the lightnings?
    *   As they are fleeing up the pass, rather than an avalanche, they come upon some lightnings preying on a lost cloud.
    *   Noxy forces her cloud to fly close to them.
    *   Feels bad about it afterward - did what she needed to, even though it was wrong.
*   Mention soldiers' masks whenever they're on duty.
*   Give directions shipwise, not compasswise.
*   "As dead as a dog".
*   Re-do scenes with Ulfmaerr.
    *   He knows who Noxy is - he just doesn't care.
    *   Noxy remembers all the things they did together when she was little, and it hurts.
*   Make Sensy a boy, so Sensy + Rash is matter-of-fact same-sex
*   Lots more animals in the village (chickens, etc.) but none gifted
*   Mention the *tralpa*'s house
    *   Nicest house in Stale, but empty since the *tralpa- ran away.
    *   Villagers assume Dorbu will stay there, but he demurs ("I'm just one of the troops").
    *   Later assume Shudarga will stay there, but she demurs as well, and chews Dorbu out for not putting the wounded there.
    *   "We need to break old habits of mind."
*   Grappa Gas's wooden leg sprouts new buds in the spring
*   The princess arrives with a hawk.

## Scenes

1.  [plot development / day 1] Noxy and others are picking spider
    webs; describe the village and its surroundings, including the
    cloud pen; they are interrupted by a troll (standoff as both are
    frightened of the other); troll is scared away by Young Gas who
    says there are soldiers in the village; Thokmay, Kulbinder, Dorbu,
    and a few others arrive, exhausted by their attempt to scout a way
    through the forest.  Foreshadow that Noxy can mind-hear clouds
    from a distance, but she hasn't realized it: she just knows
    something's wrong (Pillow and Big Blue are agitated).  Some of the
    soldiers were cut off by a landslide and need rescue - "the forest
    really doesn't want to let them through".  And the trolls have
    been harassing them - "the forest's servants".

2.  [danger / day 1] Most of the adults are away rounding up clouds;
    Noxy begs to be allowed to come along, Indy's first reaction is
    'no', but Granna Fee points out the youngers need to learn how to
    do a rescue, so they get to go.  Noxy, Sensy, and Rash are with
    Grappa Gas while Aft and Indy take the other cloud to do the
    actual rescue.  Turns out to be more soldiers than Dorbu had let
    on, so they need to use both clouds; Noxy's tension unsettles Big
    Blue, so Aft accidentally scrapes against a mountain, causing a
    snowslide, but the soldiers are rescued.

3.  [conflict / day 1] People coming to Indy's one by one for tea -
    get some of the background to the rebellion, get to know the
    villagers and their dynamics.  Discussion is interrupted by
    commotion outside as Kulbinder chases a troll over the
    rooftops. (Trolls are Gifted chimpanzees - Kulbinder uses the
    word.)  He thinks it might be a spy; the Stalers know it's just
    from the local troop.  (Noxy makes a bad Joke here about "troop of
    trolls" and "troop of soldiers".)  Stalers don't want the trolls
    hurt, since that will just cause trouble - Indy says she'll talk
    to the troop's alpha (sighing, yet another job).

4.  [conflict + romance + mystery / day 2] Thokmay is given the
    morning off by Kulbinder; plays snakes and whistles with the other
    children; see Sensy and Rash rebelling against Noxy's bossiness
    while the junior love triangle play out.  When Thokmay loses to
    Rash, Noxy says, "You're not as good at this game as you thought,"
    and Thokmay replies, "It depends what game you think I'm playing."
    Then we see Rash and Sensy becoming Thokmay's friends, and realize
    he lost on purpose.  Noxy asks about Thokmay's scars (in order to
    be nasty); Thokmay woodenly says that he got them for trying to
    desert. When Noxy asks Thokmay, "Is he yours?"  the answer is a
    cool, "No, I'm his".

5.  [danger + character development / day 2] Grappa Gas is excited
    about the fish pond; Kulbinder maneuvers him into giving Thokmay a
    ride to look at it; Noxy overhears discussion between Thokmay and
    Kulbinder revealing the purpose is to see if they can get away
    like this, which she can't square with Thokmay having tried to
    desert.  Still annoyed, Noxy imagines Thokmay faillng into the
    pond and is horrified when Pillow actually does it.  Dorbu rescues
    him (cloudherds don't know how to swim).  Kulbinder says "Your
    Highness!" but Noxy is the only one who hears.  Noxy realizes
    she's acting badly because she's jealous, and apologizes to Granna
    Fee, who tells her it's Thokmay she should apologize to (but she
    doesn't want to).

6.  [danger / day 2] A mountain storm closes in: "the forest is
    sending its lightnings to remind us not to walk it" so that we
    understand the forest controls the lightning.  See Dorbu and Indy
    taking an interest in each other over dinner, and learn that
    Noxy's father is "lost".  (Thokmay is there for dinner with
    Kulbinder, both because Kulbinder is an honored member of the unit
    and as Indy's way of apologizing for the dunking.)  We learn that
    Dorbu's family lost their farm because they couldn't afford to
    rent the law that would have saved it; Dorbu joined Shudarga's
    rebellion to stop that happening to other people.  Indy is
    pessimistic: people with power will always find a way to use it
    unfairly.

7.  [mystery / day 3] Stale wakes to after-storm quiet.  Noxy sees
    some footprints in the mud, follows them, sees Thokmay hiding some
    stolen food and blankets in the forest.  She is about to confront
    him when Kulbinder appears out of the woods (she's glad she's
    downwind).  She can't hear what they're saying, but Kulbinder
    clearly knows what's going on.  She goes back to tell Indy, but
    her mother scolds her for not doing her chores, so she keeps her
    discovery secret out of petulance.  As she is peeling parsnips for
    roasting, she begins to mind-hear the clouds.  Frightened, she
    diffidently asks Granna Fee about it (saying, "one of the soldiers
    was wondering," which gives Granna Fee a chance to say, "Oh, are
    you sweet on one too?").  With relish, Granna Fee tells her that
    it sometimes happens, but the cloudherds who can do it go mad
    because they can't shut out the noise.  As she says that, they
    hear shouting by the main gate.

8.  [fight / day 3] Several of Dorbu's soldiers were on patrol when
    they surprised a loyalist patrol.  They drove some off and
    captured two, but as they get back to Stale, one of the two
    escapes.  Chase, fight, etc.; Aft trips a Canary to help the
    loyalist get away, but he's cornered eventually.  Dorbu talks him
    into surrendering; as he's led away, he tells Aft coldly that he
    can be on whatever side he wants, but if he ever endangers a
    Canary again, he'll answer for it.

9.  [character development + romance / day 3] Noxy finds her friends
    on the walls watching the clouds, speculating about who'd win a
    fight between the soldiers and the Stalers; Sensy and Rash go for
    walk together, leaving Noxy feeling as lonely as Thokmay.  Noxy
    finds Thokmay on the walls as well with some sticks.  Trying to
    make conversation, she asks him what he's doing.  He talks about
    making kites with his sister, and Noxy realizes how lonely he
    is. She says she's sorry he was dunked in the pond (without
    admitting she did it).  Later, though, she sees him and Kulbinder
    walking past the hut where the two prisoners are being kept;
    Thokmay keeps a lookout while Kulbinder talks to the prisoners
    (but Noxy can't hear).  Before Noxy can tell her mother, she gets
    a twinge - a cloud is coming.

10. [plot development / day 3] Princess Shudarga arrives on a cloud
    flown by Tasteless with a handful of bodyguards, while Bonzon
    arrives on foot with a couple of dozen soldiers (who are much
    scarier than Dorbu's).  Unlike Dorbu's troops, Shudarga's are
    hardened, and command rather than cajole.  The patrol that Dorbu's
    men surprised was hunting for Shudarga, who is in full
    retreat. Her army can't escape because the forest won't let them
    through. (Grappa Gas says that forests are like him: they like
    things the way they are.)  Shudarga's makes a set-piece speech
    explaining the rebellion - she's sincere about making the world
    better, but still thinks like nobility when it comes to breaking
    commoner eggs. (Happens when she announces that the rebels are
    going to take the clouds the Stalers are rounding up in order to
    ferry the army to Chaghan - Indy says, "But without those clouds,
    no crops in Gandan - people will go hungry," to which Shudarga
    replies, "People are already going hungry.") - Indy confronts
    Dorbu, believing the whole thing has been a set-up; he protests
    that it wasn't, and we see that while he believes in the cause,
    he's uncomfortable with the methods.

11. [mystery / day 4] Thokmay has stayed out of the way since Shudarga
    arrived, but Noxy catches him stealing a small dayglass
    lantern. She feels betrayed, and says she's going to tell her
    mother - "Or maybe the princess or that captain of hers" - at
    which point Kulbinder pounces on her.  Thokmay reveals he's a
    prince; Shudarga will know his face, so he needs to escape.  He
    tries the "enemy of my enemy" argument (if you don't like the
    rebels, you must be a loyalist) and Noxy tells him scornfully it's
    not like that: she can be against both sides.  Kulbinder knew that
    the forest would stop them going through to Chaghan - has been
    trying to delay so that loyalist forces can catch up and rescue
    Thokmay.  Before Noxy can decide what to do, Young Gas stumbles
    in, sees Noxy pinned, and goes yelling for help.

12. [chase / day 4] Noxy, Thokmay, and Kulbinder are dragged in front
    of Captain Bonzon.  Shudarga recognizes Thokmay, so they have to
    run (leaving behind the stuff he has cached).  Their flight is a
    recap of the loyalist soldier running through Stale the day
    before.  Noxy calls Big Blue from a distance: she, Thokmay, and
    Kulbinder run at a cliff's edge and jumping onto it to escape.

13. [danger / day 4] As the threesome argue about what to do, another
    storm comes up.  They are lashed by rain and threatened by
    lightning, which makes the cloud very skittish.  Noxy eventually
    decides to go and find Ulfmaerr to get help.  She leads them to
    his old home, but he is gone.  They decide to spend the night, but
    are attacked by mountain trolls and forced to flee.

14. [fight / day 5] Noxy is exhausted by the time the sun comes
    up. They begin arguing again about what to do, but then Tasteless
    finds them.  There is a cloud fight; Noxy slows him down by
    mind-speaking confusion to Tasteless's cloud, but loses
    concentration when Tasteless tells Noxy that Aft tried to stop the
    rebels from going after the prince, and was beaten badly for
    it. Dorbu reluctantly confirms this, and says that if Noxy doesn't
    come back, Granna Fee will be next.  Noxy is about to give in when
    birds start flying around them - they've found Ulfmaerr.

15. [plot development + heartbreak / day 5] Ulfmaerr drives off
    Tasteless.  Noxy and the others land.  They talk to Ulfmaerr, who
    lives in a new cave (an old spell price prevents him sleeping in
    the same home twice - if he lives somewhere long enough, it
    becomes a home).  He cured a plague of scribbles that came through
    the mountains years ago by giving up his ability to remember the
    people he loves.  (He has inky scars like writing on his arms from
    being infected himself.)  Flashback to Noxy remembering him caring
    for her, and an explanation of how magic works.  Thokmay asks
    about Noxy's conrol of Tasteless's cloud; Noxy explains what she's
    afraid of.  Noxy falls asleep hearing Tasteless's cloud in the
    distance.

16. [conflict + fight / day 5] Kulbinder wakes Noxy to say that
    soldiers are coming - Tasteless must have ferried them in.  Dorbu
    gets to the cave first and tries to persuade Thokmay to give
    himself up; Thokmay says he won't be a prisoner, and won't be used
    against his father.  Bonzon appears as they're talking and says,
    "You'll be used as we'll use you!"  He captures Thokmay and is
    going to hamstring him to stop him running away; Kulbinder can't
    intervene because he's netted.  Dorbu snaps and intervenes; Dorbu
    and Bonzon fight while Thokmay escapes with Ulfamerr's help; Dorbu
    falls to his death.

17. [conflict + awe / day 5] Arguing again about what to do, this time
    with Ulfmaerr in the mix, but Thokmay doesn't want to run for
    Gandan any more: he wants revenge for Dorbu's death, and Noxy
    wants to help her village.  Ulfmaerr says he knows a way.  They go
    ask the forest for help from the trolls.  Ulfmaerr has nothing
    left to offer the forest, but Noxy offers herself - before the
    trees can agree, Thokmay offers his rulership in exchange for
    lightning as well as the trolls.

18. [fight / day 6] The forest brews a storm so that its lightnings,
    trolls, and other creatures can attack Stale; Kulbinder goes after
    Shudarga, revealing just how much he loved Dorbu, but Bonzon
    intervenes; Bonzon and Kulbinder go over the side (Kulbinder
    survives, wounded), but Shudarga escapes on Tasteless.

19. [character development / later] See Grappa Gas caring for the
    badly-injured Aft; Indy grieving for Dorbu; Thokmay gives Noxy a
    kite and they go off to fly it together as the other villagers
    return with their clouds.

## Characters

### The Cloudherds of Stale (full name "Stale Leftovers")

*   Noxy (Probably Noxious): a 13-year-old girl; protagonist; bosses
    around the other children her age; put off when they start to
    follow Thokmay instead; doesn't actually have a crush on Rash, but
    has decided that he's hers, and doesn't leave a lot of room for
    Sensy and Rash to get together.
    *   Character development: realizes that other people have their
        own lives, plans, feelings, etc.

*   Sensy (Burning Sensation): Noxy's best friend; also 13.  Has a
    crush on Rash, but hasn't acted on it (is a bit shy, and Noxy
    doesn't leave a lot of space).

*   Rash (May Cause a Rash): a 14-year-old boy; didn't go cloudherding
    the year before because of a broken leg; interested in Sensy, but
    Noxy doesn't leave much space.

*   Indy (Literally Indigestible): Noxy's mother; mayor of Stale; torn
    between her sense of duty and her desire to have a life.

*   Granna Fee (Induces Fever): Indy's mother, Noxy's grandmother,
    always has advice for her daughter.
    *   Also has advice for Noxy - the two of them are closer than
        either is to Indy.

*   Grappa Gas (Gastric Discomfort): an old man; full of stories,
    argues constantly with his son Dis; a loyalist (partly to give him
    something to argue about with his son).
    *   Excited about rebuilding Stale's fish pond; wants to believe
        the rebellion can still succeed so that he can do that.

*   Aft (Disgusting Aftertaste): a grown man; Grappa Gas's father and
    Young Gas's father.  Had a crush on Indy when younger; makes no
    secret of the fact that he thinks he'd be a better mayor.  He
    supports Shudarga (mostly because his father is a loyalist), and
    feels betrayed when Shudarga shows up and acts like a conqueror.
    *   Has stayed behind in Stale because there's a baby on the
        way. (Mention his wife, Weakens Eyesight, but she's not a
        character.)

*   Young Gas (Gastric Discomfort): a little boy; Aft's son.

### Gandan-o

*   Prince Thokmay: 13 years old; officially Kulbinder's servant, but
    secretly royalty in training; accidentally finds himself in a unit
    loyal to Prince Shudarga's rebellion.
    *   Development: realizes that his privileges bring
        responsibilities.

*   Kulbinder: a Gifted tiger; officially scout for the Angry
    Canaries, but secretly Thokmay's bodyguard and tutor.

*   King Denpa: current ruler of Gandan; Thokmay's father (but that's
    a secret revealed only after the bad guys arrive).

### Rebels

*   Prince Shudarga: rebelled to replace pay-per-law with law-for-all;
    on the right side, but ruthless.  (Calls herself "King".)

*   Sergeant Dorbu: commander of the Angry Canary troop since its
    captain's death a couple of weeks before the story starts;
    cheerful, dedicated, fond of Thokmay; becomes involved with Indy;
    believes in Prince Shudarga's cause, but becoming disillusioned
    with her willingness to sacrifice others to the cause.  Eventually
    takes a stand to defend Thokmay, and is killed.
    *   Background: family lost its farm because they couldn't afford
        to rent the law that would have saved it.

*   Colonel Bonzon: commands the Ferocious Swallows troop that arrives
    with Prince Shudarga to occupy Stale.

### Others

*   Ulfmaerr: a magician, originally from Vaarda; Noxy's father (but
    that's revealed gradually - he doesn't remember, because he traded
    family for magic).

*   Tasteless: cloudherd pirate "captain" working with Shudarga;
    believes in wrecking things more than he believes in equality.

*   Big Blue and Pillow: two clouds kept in Stale through the winter.

## Back Story

*   Candidates for the throne spend time incognito as part of their
    training, and are then elected to rule.
    *   The royal family owns the law that governs succession, so they
        get to decide who's eligible and when votes are held.
*   Royalty own laws, which must be rented to be used.  It's a deeply
    unfair system, but normal in this world.
    *   Include one speech by Shudarga explaining this.
*   Thokmay was assigned to Dorbu's troop (the Angry Canaries) as part
    of his training; they were in the field when Prince Shudarga
    rebelled.
*   Shudarga was winning when the neighboring kingdoms stepped in
    (they were afraid her rebellion would spread).
*   The combined armies broke the rebellion and drove Shudarga into
    the mountains.
*   Thokmay is now trapped: he can't reveal his identity without
    becoming a hostage.  Did try to sneak away once; when he was
    caught, Kulbinder pretended Thokmay had been trying to desert and
    scarred his face.
    *   When Noxy asks about it (as they're getting to know each
        other), Thokmay says, "He saved my life."  Real meaning only
        becomes clear after the reveal.
*   Noxy, Sensy, and Rash are supposed to cloudherd for the first time
    this summer.
    *   Rash is touchy about the fact that he couldn't go last year
        because of his broken leg.
    *   When the Angry Canaries arrive, most of Stale's adults are
        already on their way up to the ice fields to round up the clouds.
    *   The only people left are the children, the grandparents, and a
        handful of adults.
    *   So the oldest children (Noxy, Sensy, and Rash) are bossing the
        others around, Noxy more than most.
        *   "You're not the mayor!" (Sensy)
        *   "I will be one day!" (Noxy)

*   The local laird (who ran away to the capital as soon as rebellion
    was raised) had been blocking Stale from rebuilding its fish pond
    by using a law governing the building of stone walls.
    *   After he fled, Grappa Gas immediately began making plans to do
        the work.
    *   Tries to talk soldiers into helping - Indy asks Dorbu whether
        there's really any point, and Dorbu's non-answer tells her that
        the rebellion is failing.

*   Noxy has been having strange dreams about flying.
    *   "Normal in a girl your age with your changes coming." (Granna
        Fee)
    *   But then she mind-hears Pillow becoming agitated just before
        Tasteless arrives, and starts to wonder if she's going to go
        crazy.
        *   There are stories about cloudherds who can mind-talk
            without touching the clouds, and they all end with the
            cloudherd going mad because she can't shut out the noise.
            She uses this power to aid their escape on Big Blue.
        *   Calls the cloud as they're running, maneuvers it into
            position, and they jump.

*   Ulfmaerr is a Vaardan magician
    *   Wandered into Stale years ago
        *   Can't sleep under the same roof twice (not even a tent)
        *   So he sleeps in caves
    *   He and Indy were in love - he's Noxy's father - but he has
        traded memories of that for magic
    *   He talks to the forest
        *   Calls it "the real passenger on this voyage" - people are
            just stowaways
        *   Indy dismisses it, but it foreshadows later events
    *   Goes to the forest to trade something for its help saving Stale
    *   He has nothing left that the forest wants
    *   So Thokmay trades rulership

*   Adolescent love triangle: Noxy, Sensy, and Rash.
    *   Rash and Sensy are interested in each other.
    *   Noxy isn't really interested in Rash, but likes to be in
        charge, and is afraid that three will become two plus one.

*   New kid in town: Noxy, Sensy, and Thokmay.
    *   Sensy is naturally flirtatious, and Thokmay is interesting.
    *   Partly to make Rash jealous, partly just to stretch her wings.
    *   Thokmay isn't really interested, but has learned enough at
        court to be charming (though he's taken aback at the
        consequences: make that part funny).

*   Grown-up romance: Dorbu and Indy.
    *   The sergeant is naturally charming, and Indy has been focused
        on work for a long time.
    *   Contrast people who know what they're doing with the
        awkwardness and boundless possibility of the children.
    *   Makes Dorbu's death even more tragic.

*   Loyalty vs. conscience: Shudarga, Thokmay, Dorbu, Kulbinder
    *   Shudarga believes that the system is wrong, and has risked
        everything to change it.
        *   Accused by loyalists like Grappa Gas of using the cause as
            a cover for her own ambition.
        *   "I will stand to election like every general we've ever
            had, but everyone will vote."
    *   Kulbinder: cats believe in people, not ideas.
    *   Dorbu is a believer as well, but it's a practical belief
        rather than ideological.
        *   Not sure things will be better (can see that the law will
            belong to who can hire the best lawyer, rather than rent the
            most useful laws - makes an analogy with mercenaries), but if
            what you're doing doesn't work, try something else.
        *   Runs headlong into his belief in people (he's like
            Kulbinder in that respect)
        *   When Shudarga discovers who Thokmay is, and decides to use
            him as a hostage to cover his escape by cloud to Chaghan,
            Dorbu has to make a decision.
    *   Thokmay: believes in the system because that's how he's been
        raised, but stories like Grappa Gas's about not being able to
        build a fishpond because someone was using the law to squeeze
        money out of the village makes him start to doubt.
        *   So does his exposure to Dorbu and his story (which Dorbu
            tells when Thokmay's response to Grappa Gas's story is, "But
            that's just one person.")
        *   Thokmay's response fuels Dorbu's suspicions that Thokmay
            isn't who he appears to be.
        *   Which causes a crisis for Dorbu...

*   The rebellion
    *   Shudarga was winning until neighboring kingdoms stepped in.
    *   Believes she can find refuge in Chaghan.
        *   "They like my ideas even less, but they'll do anything to
            poke a stick in Gandan's eye."
    *   The pass is blocked by Gandan-o troops, so they're going to try
        to flee on cloudback.
        *   Hold Stale until the cloudherds come back down from the
            ice fields, then force the villagers to take them to Chaghan.
        *   Hold the children and oldish hostage.
    *   This is what breaks Aft: not willing to have his children be
        hostages.
        *   Caught when he tries to break Thokmay out, and punished for it.
        *   At which point we see that Grappa Gas really does love him.

A thousand years ago,
the Makers created dozens of hybrid species,
then vanished,
leaving behind half-human creatures with strange powers,
robots in need of parts and purpose,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.
This 35,000-word story for middle grade children (ages 8-10)
is set in that world.

        -   When Sindy gets upset, Maddy drops her book
        -   "Look what you made me do!" says Maddy (foreshadowing - turns out Sindy *did* make her do it)
    -   Walk past the ancient sentry post in the middle of the village
        -   Looked like black glass, ageless
        -   No moss or birds: shocks anything that touches it

        -   Gumption wants to go around
        -   Maddy insists that they go past
        -   Bluster bullies them: "You think you're some kinda smarties?"
        -   Smarty Leaf is there (somehow, unnoticed) and rebukes him
        -   His glower says, "This isn't over."
    -   Maddy and Gumption sneak away to the river to get away from everything
        -   Mention that they go past the brick wall that Mayor Lupus has been building forever
    -   Salvage has washed up
    -   They know they should go tell adults, but Gumption is angry about Bluster's bullying
    -   Tries to drag some solar panels out of the water
    -   They shift, trapping his foot, then shift again, pulling him under the water!
    -   A rasping voice, "Alert!  Danger!  Extricate!  Extricate!"
2.  A Stranger!
    -   A battered bot bursts out of hiding (Dockety, but we don't know the name yet)
    -   Maddy shrieks, thinking it's about to attack, but it lifts the panel long enough for Gumption to get free
    -   Maddy is helping Gumption when Dockety is struck by a dislodged piece of debris and knocked off its feet
        -   Collision knocks a small black antenna unit loose
    -   Gumption grabs it, tells Maddy to help ("It saved me, we have to save it!")
    -   They struggle back to shore, during which Dockety catches Maddy when she loses her footing
    -   Children don't know what to do
    -   Ask, "What are you doing here?"
    -   Bot
        -   "This is unable to---" stops, tentatively reaches up to broken aerial unit.
        -   "This now appears able to reply.  This is part of a sneak attack on Location Six Bitty Six, also referred to as 'Rusty Bridge'."
        -   Children: "Attack? When?"
        -   *Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think, then brightened.  "Tonight."*
3.  You Have to Listen!
    -   Maddy has a flashback to the bot attack in which her father disappeared
        -   Maddy was supposed to watch Sindy
        -   Sindy got away looking for their parents
        -   Their father distracted the bots in order to save her
    -   Argument
        -   She gets angry at Dockety and hits it
        -   Gumption stops her: "We have to warn everyone."
        -   Maddy sags: "They won't believe us."
        -   Gumption: "They will if---where are you going?"
        -   Bot: "It does not like being attacked."
        -   Gumption: "But you *have* to come with us."
        -   Bot (slowly): "This...does not have to do anything any more.  This can *choose* again."
        -   Wheels away at high speed (surprises them with its wheel)
    -   Children hurry back to the village to tell Mama Roo
    -   Mama Roo doesn't want to listen: "You really hurt your sister's feelings."
    -   Maddy loses her temper: "She should go find her own friends!  But anyway, the bots are coming."
        -   Maddy sees Sindy sitting listening at the top of the stairs
        -   Sindy starts crying again
        -   Maddy feels bad
        -   Trips on her way out of the house (foreshadowing again)
    -   Go to the mayor's
    -   Mayor is skeptical
        -   "A bot told you?"
        -   Gumption shows them the antenna that was knocked off Dockety, but they still don't believe
        -   "That could just be salvage"
    -   Feeling helpless, they head home
    -   Bump into Smarty Leaf
    -   Explain the story, show him the antenna
    -   His eyes widen in recognition
    -   And the shouting starts
4.  The Attack
    -   A goat farmer has run into town, pants, "The bots are coming!  The bots are coming!"
    -   Rumbling on the road
    -   Smarty Leaf tells the children to run
        -   Mama Roo: "You have to come with us!"
        -   Smarty: "Madam, I am a turtle.  We don't run." [pause] "Mostly because we can't."
    -   A bot appears spewing smoke
        -   Makes people feel weak and then fall down (villagers have run into it before)
    -   A big bot appears towing a cage cart (Crusher, but we don't know the name yet)
    -   Smarty Leaf takes a stance and gestures
    -   The earth opens up and Crusher's front tread gets caught
        -   It tries to lever itself out with its enormous arms
    -   Smarty Leaf gestures again to create potholes and ridges to block the half-dozen smaller bots
        -   "Go!  Run!" he orders the Roos and Gumption
    -   Villagers are gathering
        -   Scraps of armor
        -   Axes for hacking, metal poles to jam in limbs
    -   Tasercase appears shouting orders
    -   Crusher grabs Gumption and is about to throw him in the cage cart
    -   A brick strikes Crusher hard, then another and another
    -   Tasercase orders Crusher to protect his antenna
    -   He drops Gumption to do it
    -   "Get that one!" Smarty Leaf yells at the villagers, who focus attacks on Tasercase
    -   Tasercase orders a retreat, but Sindy and two grownups have been caught and are in the cage cart!
5.  Unlikely Help
    -   Maddy is frantic: she remembers her father being taken, and she feels remorse for her angry words with her sister that morning
    -   "We have to after them!" is met with the mayor's, "No---they'll just take more of us."
        -   He thinks that Smarty Leaf was responsible for the bricks
        -   The Smarty is too exhausted to contradict him
    -   Desperate, Maddy plunges into the forest, calling for help
    -   Finds Dockety near another sentry post, recharging
    -   He threatens her with a brick
    -   Tense negotiation (this is where Maddy learns Dockety's name)
        -   Maddy: "You helped us---help us again!"
        -   Bot: "This was not trying to help you. This was trying to free its..." and pauses, buzzing.
        -   ... "This cannot retrieve the word from memory.  This wanted to help its..."
        -   Maddy: "The big one?  The big one pulling the cart?"
        -   ... "If you help me get my sister I'll help you with...with it."
        -   Dockety agrees, but says they'll never catch up
        -   "Unless you allow me to carry you."
    -   Speed down the path
        -   Maddy closed her eyes, but that just made it worse, so she opened them, which made it even worse
    -   Reach the highway to Heck (broken down, but still better than forest tracks)
    -   The sun is starting to go down
    -   A pair of thin green laser lines scan the fractured pavement to help Dockety steer
    -   They pass under a line of ruined arches and startle a fluffle of wild rabbits
        -   The kind that wolves sometimes ate, but never around non-carnivores
    -   There in front of them is the convoy: half a dozen bots, no two alike, with Crusher pulling the cage cart
        -   "Where are the others?" Maddy asked, shouting to be heard.
        -   "This does not know."  Dockety paused.  "That worries this."
    -   Dockety: "Take this brick. Get on the cage. Climb forward, then climb onto the one pulling the cart. Break its antenna."
    -   Maddy: "Do you have a short circuit or something!?"
    -   Dockety: "Several.  But it is still a good plan."
    -   He races forward, knocks one unsuspecting pair of bots out of the way, and throws Maddy onto the cart
6.  Out of the Cage Cart...
    -   Maddy drops the brick
    -   Dockety races forward and body checks another bot just as it raises itself to grab at Maddy
    -   The goats and Sindy are yelling for help
    -   Maddy slides down to the front of the cart and unhitches it just as Crusher's head swivels 180 to see what's happening
    -   She expects the cart to slow down gently but it careens off the road
    -   Maddy is thrown into some bushes as the cart tips onto its side and slides down a rocky hill
    -   She grabs a scrap of rebar that just happens to be lying there and breaks the lock
    -   Bluster and Bravo Goat scramble out
        -   Sindy is stuck
        -   The goats are going to leave her
        -   Maddy rescues her
    -   Maddy hugs Sindy
        -   The goats are scared but immediately start scoffing that they were just about to escape themselves
    -   "Was that a *bot* helping you?" Blsuter asks
    -   "Don't worry about that now," Maddy snaps.  "We have to *go*!"
    -   "But---but we're in the Mire!"
    -   Just then Crusher appears at the top of the hill
        -   Dockety tries to reason with it, but it doesn't respond
        -   They flee
    -   Describe the Mire: overgrown with weeds, puddles are strange colors
        -   The trees are twisted, but they don't move on their own like they did in stories
    -   Bravo has hurt his leg
        -   "You help him," Maddy tells Bluster.  "I'll look after my sister."
        -   "Who put you in charge?" Bluster demands.
        -   Maddy faces off against him.  "You did when you left Sindy in the cage cart."
    -   It's getting dark, but they can hear gears grinding behind them whenever they stop
        -   Sindy: "Do you think they have searchlights?  Or flamethrowers?"
        -   Maddy: "I'm sure they don't have flamethrowers," she replied, trying to sound more confident than she felt.
    -   Suddenly the long-legged bot ambushes them and drives them toward the stream
        -   One of its arms ends in a clumsy overweight chainsaw
    -   A boat is waiting for them
        -   Realize that the other bots have been driving them toward it
    -   The sawbot swings, Sindy shrieks, chain of accidents, the sawbot cuts a tree that falls onto the boat
        -   The boatbot's controller is damaged
    -   Maddy: "Go!"
    -   The goats clamber onto the boat
        -   The sawbot chases them
        -   The tree tumbles into the water
        -   The sawbot is destroyed
    -   The goats are now in the boat while Sindy and Maddy are on the shore
    -   Dockety reappears
        -   Goats flee
        -   Bravo shouts, "We'll get help!"
7.  ...And Into the Mire
    -   Dockety is sad and angry about the demise of the sawbot and the boatbot
        -   "It did not have a choice. Bots do not have choices when governors are put on them."
    -   Dockety is damaged
        -   Sindy: "Does it hurt?"
        -   Dockety: (reluctantly) "It buzzes.  Where the hole is."
        -   Sindy finds a metal plate from the sawbot that fits perfectly over the hole.
        -   Comment about how lucky she is.
        -   Sindy: "I don't feel very lucky."
    -   Something hoots in the distance
        -   Sindy: "How are we going to get home, Maddy?"
        -   Maddy: "I don't know.
        -   Dockety: "We cannot stay here."  (Howl comes again.)  "There are worse things than Eight Fifty Bee."
    -   Pick their way through increasingly swampy ground, heading downstream
        -   Sometimes have to go single file
        -   No idea what to do if the track runs out
        -   The river and the road are getting closer together, and night is falling
    -   Sindy complains about being hungry
        -   Maddy is about to snap at her, but bites her tongue
        -   "I'm hungry too," she says.  "And scared.  I bet Mama's scared too."
    -   Something gloops in the river, then again, and they realize they're being hunted
    -   The only other option is back to the road, but Dockety knows Tasercase and its crew will be patrolling
    -   They come across a concrete bunker
        -   Looks like it was buried in mud, but the spring floods have washed it away
        -   Dockety: "Processing... It is not in the database."
    -   Maddy: "We'll stay here for the night."
        -   Over Sindy's protests about spiders: we have to hide somewhere, and it's almost dark
    -   Once inside, Dockety makes a light with its screen
        -   Whatever is hunting them splooshes out of the water and comes snuffling after them
    -   A long mechanical tentacle draped in river weed gropes inside the bunker
    -   As she scrambles back, Sindy grabs at something that looks like rebar sticking out of the wall
    -   It's a lever, and when she pulls it, a door starts to open in the hillside
    -   They work together to get the door open
        -   "Whatever's in there has got to be better than this!" as the monster started pulling blocks out of the bunker
    -   They get the door open and rush through it
        -   Just as they do, the monster grabs Maddy's ankle!
8.  Underground
    -   They struggle to free Maddy, but the monster drags her back toward the door
    -   Sindy starts screaming
    -   The monster claws some more blocks away from the bunker door, making the roof collapse
    -   It relaxes its grip just long enough for Maddy to pull free
    -   They flee down the stairs as the bunker caves in
    -   Find themselves in an abandoned underground complex of some sort
    -   The only light comes from Dockety's screen
    -   Maddy remembers what Mama Roo said one night when she was crying: "If you can't go back, you have to go forward."
    -   She holds Sindy's hand, and is surprised when Dockety takes hold of her other hand with one of its manipulators
    -   They start talking (whistling in the dark)
        -   Dockety explains that its memory is patchy: it knows that it should know more than it does, but it doesn't know what
        -   Maddy: "What was the antenna all about?"
        -   Dockety explains that Tasercase is attaching them to whatever bots it can catch, then using its drones to catch more bots
        -   Dockety: "This remembers Crusher.  This does not know why, but those memories create strong positive feedback."
        -   Maddy: "So he's a friend?"
        -   Dockety: "This...thinks so?"
        -   Swivels head to look at Maddy: "But Crusher is an 'it', please, as is this."
    -   Sindy: "I'm really hungry"
        -   Dockety: "This requires a battery recharge soon."
    -   Not looking where it's going, it almost falls in a hole
        -   Teeter on the edge
        -   Maddy and Sindy haul as hard as they can
        -   Sindy's hand falls on yet another lever
        -   Lights start to come on
        -   They pull Dockety back
        -   Maddy looks at Sindy: "That's the second time you've done that."
        -   Sindy (defensively): "Sorry."
        -   Maddy: "No no, I---don't be sorry."  She squeezed her sister's hand.  "You keep doing it."
    -   A voice through speakers: "You are here now. You might as well come and say hello."
9.  Patient in Darkness
    -   The lights lead them to a control room
    -   A bot decorated with baroque twists of metal, glued-on pictures faded to illegibility, and things Maddy filed away to have nightmares about later
    -   "Welcome! This is Patient in Darkness" it proclaims proudly.
    -   When Maddy says, "That's a strange name," it says, "This chose the name itself.  It is an accurate designation of activity.  Observe!"
    -   Lights go out.
        -   Sindy says, "I'm scared."
        -   "Sh!  These must *listen* to darkness."
    -   Figure out through conversation that they are in a satellite ground station
        -   "Regrettably, the main antenna malfunctioned some time ago."
        -   Dockety: "These did not notice an antenna."
        -   Patient (pointedly to Maddy): "Does *that* have a proper designation of activity? No? Then its communication is irrelevant."
        -   Maddy (to break awkward silence): "But---we didn't see an antenna."
        -   Patient: "Correct.  It took this a great deal of time to improvise an emergency repair protocol. It requires fabrication of precision parts."
        -   Patient (proudly): "Steps are now being taken.  The Makers will be pleased."
    -   Sindy starts exploring, looking for a place to sleep
        -   Looks through glass window and sees skeletons
        -   Patient (dismissively): "They declined to synchronize with the emergency repair protocol, so they were moved to long-term storage. Their components failed shortly thereafter."
    -   Realize that Patient is lonely and deranged
    -   Maddy: "Well, we should, um, leave you to it?  And be going?"
    -   Patient: "Oh no.  Leaving is not included in the protocol.  It might put the repairs at risk.  You will remain here."
        -   Light comes on: another empty office, identical to the one with the skeletons
        -   Patient: "Except for that," it added dismissively, waving a manipulator at Dockety.  "That will be recycled."
    -   Patient goes to a console and presses buttons
    -   A door opens and two service bots enter
10. Unison
    -   The service bots close in on Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety
    -   Maddy (to Sindy): "Grab a lever or something!"
    -   Sindy: "There aren't any levers to grab!"
    -   Dockety pulls a keyboard off a desk and throws it
        -   Hits one of the service bots
        -   Patient protests
        -   The service bot immediately begins to pick up the pieces
        -   Patient presses more buttons on the console
        -   Maddy realizes that the console is controlling the service bots
    -   She grabs a keyboard and throws it at the console
        -   Misses
        -   Tells Sindy to do it
        -   Lucky hit: the door they came through opens again
    -   They run, but one of the service bots catches Dockety
    -   Maddy makes a split-second decision and goes back for him
    -   Breaks off one of Dockety's arms so that he can escape
        -   She winds up holding the arm
    -   They flee and the door closes
    -   They are briefly in darkness, but then the lights come on again
        -   Patient: "Where will you go?"
        -   Realize that it is watching them through cameras
    -   As they explore, Patient keeps talking to them
        -   Dockety starts echoing its words
        -   Angry, Maddy begins to smash them with Dockety's arm
        -   Patient: "Please don't do that."
        -   Dockety: "Please don't do that." (simultaneous)
    -   Patient and Dockety speaking in time with each other
        -   Dockety shakes it off, but it recurs
        -   Dockety: "This cannot resist attempts to circumvent integrity for very long."
    -   They reach the hole they almost fell into the previous time
        -   Sindy kicks a rock
        -   They hear it hit stone a moment later
        -   Realize that the hole isn't very deep
    -   Maddy: "Nothing else for us up ahead"
    -   Sindy offers to jump
        -   Maddy says it's too dangerous
        -   Gets Dockety to lower her by holding onto its broken arm
    -   Sindy: "What if...what if you can't get back out?  What if he leaves you down there?" (whispering) "What if he goes all the way bad?"
    -   Dockety: "This is an it, thank you.  And this will self-destruct before it allows itself to be turned into a drone again."
    -   Maddy (hug): "I'll come back.  I promise"
11. Eyes Everywhere
    -   The lower corridor is cold instead of cool
    -   Emergency lights turn on automatically
        -   Maddy waits to hear Patient's voice, but it doesn't come
    -   First stop is labeled "Armory #4", which makes her think of Dockety's arm
        -   But inside are canisters with caution labels
    -   Explores a bit until she finds another control room, empty and waiting
    -   A diffident little cleaning bot comes out to dust
        -   Rolls under a desk and lifts it hydraulically
        -   Freezes when it notices Maddy
        -   Maddy: "You don't have to be afraid."
    -   It leads her to a workstation in front of a dozen screens and presses a combination of switches
    -   Maddy realizes that the sentry posts have cameras and microphones, and that Patient has been watching everything
        -   Images are black and white: she realizes that it must be night outside
    -   And microphones: she can hear her mother arguing with Mayor Lupus
        -   "We have to go get them!"
        -   "They were taken by bots, Ibby."
        -   "But they escaped!"
        -   "Into the Mire.  With bots chasing them.  It's too dangerous."
    -   Smarty Leaf steps forward: "I will go."
        -   The two goats who were captured offer to go too.
        -   A few others step forward
        -   They hear Bluster telling his friends how stupid they all are, they're going to get killed, etc.
    -   Motion in one of the other screens
        -   A convoy of two dozen bots led by Tasercase
        -   Maddy recognizes the line of ruined arches
        -   Bots are going to make another attack!
12. Reconfiguration
    -   Maddy hurries back to the hole
    -   No response when she first calls up, but when she raises her voice, they answer
        -   Sindy had fallen asleep
        -   Dockety was in energy conservation mode (which also helps shield it from Patient's control)
    -   Maddy tells them what she has seen
        -   Sindy climbs down
        -   Dockety drops, bounces on his single wheel, says, "Ouch."
        -   Sindy: "Did that hurt?"
        -   Dockety: "This does not feel pain." pause "But this would not actively pursue a repeat."
    -   Maddy leads them to the second control room
        -   Dockety can't hear Patient's voice
        -   Finds a recharger (Sindy is jealous)
    -   Maddy and Sindy try to figure out what to do
        -   Maddy jokes again about pulling a lever
        -   Sindy starts crying: "It's not my fault!"
        -   Maddy tries to comfort her
        -   Sindy: "You and mama---you never say it, but I know you think it's my fault papa was taken."
        -   Maddy: "No---it's my fault."
    -   The cleaner bot comes out and shyly gives them a carefully-cleaned collection of paper clips
        -   Maddy makes appreciative noises
        -   It scurries away and comes back with a ruler and three pencils
        -   And then a few sheets of paper in a clear plastic binder
        -   Sindy says, "This is really nice," and then takes her bracelet off and gives it to the bot
    -   Dockety wakes up
    -   They agree they have to stop the attack, but they'll never get there in time
    -   Dockety has downloaded a schematic of the site
        -   Dockety: "It is possible to reach them in time."
        -   Maddy: "How?"
        -   Dockety: "Reconfiguration."
    -   Dockety displays a map
        -   Dockety: "We must reach this location"
    -   Maddy asks the cleaner bot to come with them
        -   It rocks back and forth in agitation
        -   Dockety: "It will not leave its duties without appropriate authorization.  There is nothing we can do."
    -   They go through more tunnels and reach a hangar full of machine parts
        -   Including some strange shapes that would later show up in Maddy's dreams
        -   They can see the sky outside and smell fresh air
        -   Not as musty as the tunnels they've just been in
    -   Lights come on and Patient gloats about knowing where they were going from Dockety's download
    -   They are ambushed by half a dozen service bots!
13. The Windmill
    -   Dockety: "Delay them." and begins to fiddle with a strange contraption that looked like a fallen windmill
        -   Dockety: "This was meant for your kind, but with modifications..."
    -   Maddy: "How?" But even as she asked, she had an idea.
    -   She holds up the clear plastic binder: "I found your instructions."
    -   The service bots freeze
    -   Patient: "Repeat that."
    -   Maddy: "I found the Makers' instructions.  The ones you *haven't* been following.  They're going to be very disappointed."
    -   Pause, then Patient: "That is an inaccuracy intended to coerce behavior!"
    -   Maddy smiles wickedly, her heart pounding: "You mean a bluff?  Nope."
    -   Sindy shrieks as a long manipulator from a stealthy little bot behind her snatches the documents
    -   Patient: "This is a cleaning roster!"
    -   She and Sindy throw things at the cleaning bots, some of whom are distracted and start to pick things up as Patient yells, "Never mind that, get them!"
    -   Cleaning bot appears and trips up one of the service bots, but that's not going to be enough
    -   Windmill whirs to life
    -   Dockety has attached it to its chassis---though it would be more accurate to say it had attached itself to the windmill
    -   Dockety grabs them and flies into the air as the ceiling splits and opens
        -   Centuries of muck and dirt spill into the hangar
        -   Patient: "That is not authorized!"
        -   Maddy looks back and sees the ecstatic cleaning bot already starting to sweep up
14. Crash Landing
    -   "Maddy's initial splash of fright was replaced by crashing waves of terror.  There was just enough moonlight for her to see how high they were and how far they'd have to fall if Dockety let go or her coat tore or---she suddenly remembered its arm coming off and all she could think about was what if it happens again?"
    -   But Sindy is laughing with joy
    -   The bright white lights of Heck in the distance, the river, the occasional green burp of swamp gas or something worse igniting in the Mire, the road below them
    -   Sindy is the first to comment on the lights on the road and in the sky
        -   Dockety swoops down to treetop level so as not to be spotted
        -   But two of the flying bots come after them
        -   Maddy notices that they're carrying canisters like the ones she saw in the armory
    -   Approach the village
    -   Villagers in the trees shoot cable guns at them
        -   Miss the bots chasing them
        -   Dockety dodges, but with Maddy and Sindy in its arms it isn't as maneuverable
        -   Rope tangles in its rotor and it comes spiraling down
        -   Captured in a net
    -   Maddy tries to explain, but the goats and wolves and a bear named Zeke won't listen
        -   All that comes out of Dockety's speakers is hiss and crackle because of crash damage
    -   But Maddy does convince them that more bots are coming
    -   They head back to the village with Dockety wrapped in the next over Zeke's shoulder and the windmill on a pole between two wolves
    -   Bluster and Bravo are there
        -   Bravo's leg is in a splint
        -   Clear to Maddy that he's playing it up
    -   They made it back, but thought Maddy and Sindy had been captured again by Dockety
        -   Their version of events has them escaping on their own and rescuing Sindy and Maddy
    -   Bluster (to distract people): "How do we know they're not being controlled?"
        -   Mayor Lupus scoffs: "What? That's ridiculous?"
        -   But Maddy can see the idea taking hold in people's minds
        -   Even when Gumption shows up and defends her
    -   Mama Roo shows up and hugs them
        -   "Couldn't bear to lose you."
    -   Smarty Leaf as well
        -   Maddy makes a joke about how Sindy always finds the right lever to pull
        -   Smarty Leaf looks thoughtful
    -   Horn blares: bots sighted!
    -   Almost immediately the two flying bots pass overhead and drop smoke bombs!
15. Taken
    -   The smoke makes people weak
    -   People run away
    -   Dockety begins flashing a message on its screen saying it can help
    -   Maddy and Gumption struggle over to Dockety and untie it
        -   Maddy to Gumption: "Trust me."
    -   Dockety gets the windmill going to blow away the smoke and save the villagers
    -   Dockety in front of Crusher: starts flashing heart on its screen
    -   Crusher hesitates
    -   Tasercase manipulates its control and Crusher smashes Dockety out of the way
    -   Maddy and Gumption try to get the windmill upright
        -   It's heavy and awkward but somehow they manage
        -   Not really needed: with the smoke gone, the villagers rally and start defending themselves
    -   Power it down and run over to Dockety
        -   Zeke comes over with his ax to finish Dockety off
        -   Maddy defends it: "Didn't you see? It was helping!"
        -   Zeke stops, uncertain
        -   Bluster pulls the ax from his hands: "If you won't, I will!"
        -   Trips over a sudden bump in the earth
        -   Smarty Leaf steps between the goat the the bot
    -   Words flash on Dockety's screen: "Are you all right?"
        -   Maddy starts to tear up: she's OK, but the robot is clearly broken
        -   Dockety: "Acceptable." pause "It is sad for Crusher."
        -   Maddy: "It hit you!"
        -   Dockety: "Not its fault. Not its fault."
        -   Flashes start to weaken
    -   Smarty Leaf comforts her
        -   "There is nothing we can do.  It needs parts, and..."  The old turtle shrugged helplessly.  "We don't have them."
    -   Maddy and Gumption load Dockety into a wheelbarrow and take him home with Sindy and Mama Roo
    -   As they come in sight of the house, Maddy says, "I forgot something."
    -   Goes back to the village square
    -   Zeke and some goats are cleaning up
    -   Zeke picks up the windmill
    -   Maddy says, "You're supposed to leave it here for now in case they come back."
    -   Confused, the bear does as she instructs
    -   She fits her shoulders into the harness, starts it up, and flies away

20. The Beginning
    -   Last scene is Smarty Leaf, Dockety, and Crusher at the Roos' house with the Roos and Gumption
        -   On the porch because Crusher wouldn't fit inside
    -   Maddy trips, Dockety is right there to catch the bowl
    -   Smarty Leaf has some dice
    -   Turns out Sindy is a luck shaper
        -   Smarty Leaf: "You will need training.  Let's keep this between us for now."
    -   Sindy to Maddy: "Is it okay? I know you wanted to---"
    -   Maddy hugs her
    -   Dockety: "Since this is already holding the plates, shall it help clear the table?"
    -   Dockety sees the picture of Papa Roo
    -   "This is in Heck."

## To Do

-   A few things have to go wrong for Sindy
    -   Luck shapers don't always shape it their way - that's why people fear them

## Quotes

"Because there used to be a rusty bridge here," Dockety said slowly.
"We tried to repair it but we did not have parts."
Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think.
"Searching...
Yes.
It fell down.
This remembers."

"My grandmother is barely out of her egg when it happens,"
Smarty Leaf confirmed in a slow whisper.
"It is winter.
There is a terrible storm,
much wind,
much ice.
When the bridge comes crashing down,
people say,
the Makers are angry,
we should leave this place,
but others say no,
this is our home,
we will make our own bridge."

---

"Because if these clean up this mess and put things back the way they were
then the Makers will come back and everything will be *better*,"
Tasercase hissed.
"No more rust.
No more oh, this regrets, these do not have the part you require."
It waved its mis-matched manipulators for emphasis.

---

"That is just phase one of that's plan," Dockety said.

Smarty Leaf sighed.
"Why do villains' plans always have phases?
Why can't they just get on with it and do some evil?"

## Notes

-   Use "they" as the only singular pronoun, rather than "he" or "she"
    -   "If they wants to do it..." (singular form of verb)
-   Use "this" for bots, who refer to themselves as "this"

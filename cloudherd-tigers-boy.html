<p align="center"><em>For Madeleine, who is taking me on the greatest journey of my life.</em></p>
<p><em>Consider Cherne. A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight thousand gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to west. Its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to cradle that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well. Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a war that scarred the moon and turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass. When it was over the Pilots were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.</em></p>
<p><em>Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms. it is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot, 1272, and a girl who is no longer a child but not quite yet a woman is crouched on a cloud, chilled to the bone and desperately hoping that they're not too late...</em></p>
<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; Grappa Gas bellowed as they went into a dive. &quot;It's going to get bumpy!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy dropped to one knee, pulled the glove off her left hand, and pressed her palm against the cloud beneath her. She could mind-hear Big Blue's determination, but the cloud was old, older even than Grappa Gas, and they were flying straight into a headwind.</p>
<p><em>Faster!</em> she urged. <em>Please, faster!</em> She shivered despite her camelskin hat and coat, her hand already numbed by the icy mountain air.</p>
<p>Beside her, the tiger snarled as the last of the crows that had attacked them swirled overhead. One dove at his head. He reared up and swiped at it with one paw, cursing in Thindi as the black bird snapped its wings open and let the wind throw it sideways just an instant before the tiger's claws would have torn it apart.</p>
<p>Up ahead, a makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose like an island out of the forest. A dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire. Shading her eyes with her right hand, Noxy saw that the soldiers had formed a circle around it. Their kilts and sturdy boots were travel-stained, and their battle masks and lacquered leather armor were scarred from fighting. Some had swords in their hands, while others held spears or bows. Big Blue's mate Pillow floated above them, her sides rippling as she struggled to keep station in the wind, but the soldiers only spared an occasional pleading glance for the two clouds. They were looking at the trees around them, waiting for the forest to attack again.</p>
<p>&quot;You're coming in too low!&quot; Granna Fee yelled. Noxy's grandmother lay full length on Big Blue, propped up on her elbows with a pair of binoculars in her hands. &quot;Level him off!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no time!&quot; Grappa Gas yelled back, his red-and-yellow scarf flapping madly behind him. &quot;We're going to have to bump and scrape!&quot; The old man closed his eyes. His lips moved as he mind-spoke commands to the cloud beneath him. Noxy mind-heard the old bull protest, but even as he grumbled he bunched up and went into a steep dive.</p>
<p>Noxy had just a moment to think, <em>I'd be grounded for a <strong>month</strong> if I even <strong>thought</strong> about doing something like this,</em> and then the cloud thudded against the side of the peak like a sack full of wet wool. Nox yelped and sprawled forward to land in an untidy heap beside Granna Fee. &quot;Sorry!&quot; she said, but her grandmother was already up, swaying to keep her balance as the cloud scraped across bare rock, flattened two tents, and came to a halt.</p>
<p>The tiger bounded off with a roar. &quot;What are you waiting for!?&quot; Granna Fee shouted at the soldiers, sliding down Big Blue's flank and waving her arm as if to sweep them all onto the cloud. &quot;Get on! Get on!&quot;</p>
<p>As Noxy scrambled to her feet, Grappa Gas caught her arm. &quot;I'll help 'em up. You stay here and keep Blue together.&quot; Without waiting for her to answer he stumped forward, his peg leg leaving dimples in the cloud. &quot;And keep an eye out for squirrels!&quot; he added over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced back just in time to see something big and brown swing between two trees below them. Another hairy shape followed it, then another, and suddenly the trees were full of them, hooting and shaking the branches.</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa! Grappa, there's trolls!&quot; she shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;I see 'em!&quot; the old man shouted back.</p>
<p>&quot;And a bear!&quot; Noxy added as a brown bear charged out of the trees and reared up on its hind legs with a roar. The muscles under its thick fur bunched as it dropped back to all fours to charge forward a few steps, halt, and roar again.</p>
<p>&quot;'Course there's a bear,&quot; Grappa Gas grunted as he clasped hands with the nearest soldier and helped him scramble up onto the cloud. A second soldier tossed his spear aside and pulled himself up beside the first. Together, they reached back and hauled up a third man while Grappa Gas reached for a fourth.</p>
<p>But instead of grabbing the cloudherd's hand, the man on the ground lifted a heavy canvas-wrapped bundle. &quot;Never mind that, get yourself up here!&quot; Grappa Gas ordered.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not leaving them!&quot; the man on the ground yelled back. One of the soldiers already on the cloud shouldered Grappa Gas aside, grabbed a corner of the canvas, and tried to drag it onto the cloud. His legs sank halfway to his knees with the weight.</p>
<p>Noxy felt Big Blue shudder underneath her. She dropped to her knees and pressed her hand against the cloud once again. <em>Just a little longer,</em> she pleaded, trying to squelch her fear so that he couldn't mind-hear it. <em>Stay bunched up just a little longer.</em> She pictured the cloud pulling itself into a dense blob. Obediently the cloud began to contract.</p>
<p>Even as it did so, Noxy heard a shrill warning whistle from her friends on board Pillow high above them. Cold fear jellied in her gut as the trolls suddenly stopped hooting.</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa---&quot; she started to say.</p>
<p>&quot;Just keep him together!&quot; Grappa Gas snapped. Cursing, he yanked another soldier up onto the cloud. This one was just a boy, Noxy realized, no older than she was with a frightened, determined look on a face marked by four parallel scars that looked like they had only just healed. He took two steps before his feet slipped out from underneath him and sent him sprawling beside one of the half-dozen canvas-wrapped bundles that lay together in a pile.</p>
<p>The tiger scrambled up the cloud behind him. Noxy mind-heard Big Blue's protest as the great cat's claws tore wisps off his flank. <em>Just a little longer,</em> she begged. <em>Please, just a little longer.</em></p>
<p>She glanced at the forest. A brown wave spilled back and forth around the bases of the trees. Above it, the trolls began hooting again. &quot;Now now now!&quot; the Gifted ones shouted, the will of the forest surging through their minds like a raging flood. &quot;Get them get them get them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Spread yourselves out, you numbskulls!&quot; Grappa Gas thundered at the soldiers struggling not to sink into the cloud. &quot;Spread-eagle if you have to. Come on, Fee, we gotta fly!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's grandmother clambered up Big Blue's flank with a speed born from decades of practice. &quot;Now or never!&quot; she yelled at the soldier who had been lifting up the bundles. He grabbed a handful of cloud just as a swarm of squirrels burst out of the forest and surged up the rocky slope, thousands of them leaping from stone to stone, their tiny eyes fixed on the intruders and just one thought in their minds.</p>
<p><em>Up!</em> Noxy mind-yelled at Big Blue. The cloud heaved himself into the air. As the soldiers shouted and toppled over she heard Grappa Gas shout, &quot;Hold on!&quot;</p>
<p>The last soldier clung desperately to Big Blue as the cloud's flank squished between his fingers like soggy dough. The oncoming squirrels jumped at his legs. One managed to catch hold of his boot. It scrambled up the laces and sank its teeth into his calf. The soldier cursed and kicked it off. With a last desperate lunge he managed to catch hold of Grappa Gas's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;You idiot!&quot; Grappa Gas yelled as he pulled the soldier up onto Big Blue's back. &quot;You saints-be-damned <em>idiot</em>! They woulda peeled you like an apple! What was so weeping important that you couldn't just leave it?&quot; He kicked one of the bundles at his feet. &quot;Eh? What was so---urp!&quot;</p>
<p>In one smooth motion the soldier had rolled onto his feet and grabbed a handful of Grappa Gas's collar. &quot;With respect, honored, I'm grateful for the rescue,&quot; he panted, &quot;But that's one of my men you're kicking, and I'll be thanking you to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>He let go of Grappa Gas's coat. The cloudherd coughed. &quot;Ah. Sorry, lad. I didn't realize.&quot; He looked down at the bodies lying at his feet. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier nodded. &quot;Me too.&quot; He stared back at the pinnacle of rock, where the squirrels had already torn the tents to pieces. &quot;Me too.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Earlier that day...</em></p>
<p>Noxy and Sensy volunteered to collect spiderwebs that morning---or rather, Noxy volunteered them both and Sensy went along with it like she always did. Winter had finally turned to spring; stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the shadows of the twisted mountain pines, but the sun shone diamond-bright in a clear blue sky, and carding camel wool indoors suddenly seemed unbearable. Besides, getting out of the village would give them a chance for a talk that Noxy thought was long overdue.</p>
<p>&quot;Shoo.&quot; She poked a fat brown spider with a stick. It waved its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a new home. Noxy cut its web's anchor threads with two practiced twists of her knife and began winding it onto a stick.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?&quot; Sensy asked.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced at her. &quot;Why? Are those ones coming loose?&quot; She had been trying for an hour to think of a way to broach the subject of their mutual friend Rash, who was the only boy their age in the village of Stale.</p>
<p>&quot;No, they're just kind of plain.&quot; Sensy looked down at her soft brown camelskin coat critically. &quot;Granna Fee has some really nice red ones. She said she'd give them to me if I picked the stones out of her pepper garden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her whole garden? That would take forever.&quot; Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder. &quot;Why would you do all that work for buttons you don't need?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you're no help,&quot; Sensy pouted. She had spent the winter embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar. All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes, and her hair, and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer. The only thing she <em>didn't</em> want to talk about was Rash.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes,&quot; Granna Fee had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who seemed to have taken her best friend's place.</p>
<p>&quot;Not me!&quot; Noxy had declared.</p>
<p>Her grandmother had laughed. &quot;No, sweetling, not you.&quot;</p>
<p>The three children had grown up together, done chores together, played tag and make-believe in the forest around Stale together, and learned to mind-speak with clouds together, but something had changed that winter. Sometimes Noxy saw Sensy look at Rash, or Rash look at Sensy, and then look away as if they felt guilty or were afraid they might blurt out a secret. Other times they just sat there not speaking. If her two best friends were mad at one another, Noxy thought it was her job go sort it out.</p>
<p>Noxy slung her bag over her shoulder. &quot;Come on, let's go look for some more.&quot; She set off without waiting for an answer. A moment later Sensy scrambled to catch up with her.</p>
<p>The path was one of dozens that snaked through the evergreen forest surrounding Stale. Mud made it slippery where it wasn't slick with ice, but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the ridge above her home.</p>
<p>Below her lay the ancient walls of the fortress that held the village of Stale. The centuries had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as the mountains themselves. The villagers' two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the fortress like ducklings in a nest. Thin licks of smoke rose from their slate chimneys, while camel pens, vegetable plots, and racks laden with drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.</p>
<p>To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge. A net woven from spider thread stretched over its top, as light as a dream but as strong as steel. Another net hung down at the gorge's mouth to make a gate. Inside, just visible from the ridge, two gray clouds floated half-asleep.</p>
<p>Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds, riding them, and, most importantly, practicing mind-speech with them. Grownups called Big Blue and Pillow slow and lazy, but they and the herd of half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance were the most exciting things in Noxy's world.</p>
<p>As Noxy pulled her bag off her shoulder, Sensy grabbed her arm. &quot;Look!&quot; she hissed, pointing into the trees.</p>
<p>At first all Noxy saw was branches. Then a pair of dark eyes blinked, and her mouth went dry. Black fur framed a round face with heavy brows and a gray muzzle. The troll blinked again and pulled a branch aside with one long, hairy arm.</p>
<p>Noxy and Sensy took a step back, then another. A sudden rustling behind them made them freeze. With her breath caught in her throat, Noxy looked over her shoulder. A second troll hung by one hand from a branch behind them, blocking their escape.</p>
<p>&quot;Wh-what are they doing here?&quot; Sensy whispered loudly.</p>
<p>&quot;Ssh!&quot; Noxy said. &quot;Just... don't... move.&quot;</p>
<p>Branches rustled overhead. Two--- three--- four trolls swung by, except no, the fourth didn't swing by. It stopped and looked down at them. Its fur was shot through with gray, and even from five strides below it Noxy could see the long red scar that ran up the length of its left leg.</p>
<p>Something twinged in the back of her head like the start of a headache. She felt dizzy, and for a moment it was as if <em>she</em> was in the tree looking down at herself.</p>
<p>A sudden roar broke the moment. The troll hooted and vanished into the forest. Noxy and Sensy each let out a long shaky breath---</p>
<p>---and screamed as a tiger burst out of the trees half a dozen strides in front of them. His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes, not orange and black like the picture in the book that three generations of village children had passed around. A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear, and his tail twitched slightly as he looked at them, as if their presence reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you all right?&quot; he rumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;Wh-what?&quot; Noxy stammered.</p>
<p>&quot;Are... you... all... right?&quot; the tiger repeated impatiently. &quot;Did those blasted chimpanzees harm you at all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, they---I mean, we're all right. We're fine, thank you very much. Ouch, Sensy, you're going to break my fingers!&quot; Noxy pulled her hand free from her friend's terrified grip.</p>
<p>&quot;Pilots be praised,&quot; he rumbled, settling onto his haunches. &quot;Now, if I may ask a favor, I am looking for the village of Stale Leftovers. Would you be so kind as to direct me?&quot; His ear twitched at the sound of a distant hoot. &quot;Or if perchance you are going that way yourselves, I would be honored to accompany you. Those creatures are unlikely to try another attack if you have a protector.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy hitched her bag up on her shoulder. &quot;They didn't attack us. We---I mean, the village has an arrangement. With the trolls. We don't go too far into the forest, and they don't come near the village except for when they want to trade, and they leave some stones down by the fish pond to tell us when they want to do that, and---&quot; She stopped herself and took a deep breath. &quot;I'm sorry. Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am Kulbinder of Thind,&quot; the tiger said, rising to all fours. &quot;And if you will forgive my impatience, my need is rather pressing. My companions are in danger, and in dire need of rescue. I need to reach Stale Leftovers <em>now</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shot a look at Sensy. Her friend shook her head slightly and mouthed &quot;no&quot;. That was enough to make up Noxy's mind.</p>
<p>&quot;It's this way,&quot; she said, pointing down the path. &quot;Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>It only took them a few minutes to reach the gap in the fortress wall where an enormous stone door had once hung. A few chunks of its shattered remains lay half-buried in the ground, too big for even a team of sturdy mountain camels to pull free. The wooden gate that Stale's human inhabitants had put up to take its place was three planks thick, but still looked like a child's toy set into the Pilots' ancient work. It was open as always, and Noxy could hear the endless gentle tune of the village's wind chimes from behind it.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas was sitting on one of the stones whittling a new leg when they came out of the trees. He raised a hand in hello, then swore and clambered to his feet at the sight of the tiger. &quot;Saints and their creations!&quot; He pointed accusingly with his whittling knife. &quot;What in the underhells is this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>This</em> is a who, not a what,&quot; Kulbinder replied curtly.</p>
<p>&quot;We met him up by the spider grove,&quot; Noxy said hurriedly. &quot;There were some trolls, and he scared them off. He says---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trolls?&quot; Grappa Gas interrupted incredulously. &quot;Can't be. They haven't come down this far in---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa!&quot; Noxy stomped her foot. &quot;Never mind that now! The tiger says people are hurt and need help. At least, I think they're people,&quot; she added belatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;They are as human as you are,&quot; the tiger said. &quot;Are you the <em>tralpa</em> here?&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas snorted. &quot;Not likely, but I can take you to the reeve.&quot;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the whole village was in the cobbled square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who had left a week ago for the snowfields to collect Stale's clouds from their winter pasture. Three hundred people, from babies in their parents' arms to those babies' grandparents, stood in a half-circle around the impatient tiger. Some still wore the thick coats and pants they used in winter and when cloudherding. Others, like Noxy and Sensy, had switched to lighter gear that would still seem heavy to anyone unfamiliar with the icy winds of the high mountains. Grappa Gas's son Aft, who had been splitting logs with an ax to make shingles, was the only one in shirtsleeves, but he wasn't the only one scowling at the new arrival. At his side, his very pregnant wife Rind shushed him every time he muttered to her.</p>
<p>Noxy's mother Indy thumped the speaker's drum three times and stepped up onto the squared-off stone that marked the center of the square. &quot;Friends,&quot; she said loudly, patting the air with her hands to quiet everyone. &quot;Friends, please. Thank you all for coming. I know it is early in the year for travelers, but please, give a true mountain welcome to Kulbinder, a Gifted of Thind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome... welcome... be welcome...&quot; Some voices were hearty, some grudging, and some people didn't speak at all, but Noxy's mother took it all in stride, just as she always did.</p>
<p>Someone nudged Noxy's shoulder with their own. &quot;Hey,&quot; Rash said, slipping between her and Sensy. &quot;Where's the <em>tralpa</em>? Is he too afraid of the tiger to come out and say hello? Or has he been up all night studying again?&quot; He mimed someone drinking from a bottle.</p>
<p>&quot;Ssh!&quot; But he was right---the voice and hand of the king in Stale Remainders, who was also the least useful magician Noxy had ever met, was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Indy thumped the brightly-painted speaker's drum again. &quot;The Gifted has told me that he and his companions were trying to get through the pass to Chaghan. An avalanche forced them off the road and into the forest.&quot; She swept her gaze across the assembled villagers. &quot;The forest got angry. Some of them have died, and the rest are trapped. They need our help.&quot;</p>
<p>A murmur ran through the crowd. The Herd of Trees that blanketed the Brumoso Mountains wasn't mad like the Jungle of Thind, but it guarded its territory and privileges as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs. Gifted creatures who lived among the trees all did its biding. People who stayed near the Pilots' ancient roads never came to harm, and those who ventured deeper were safe as long as they were careful. Make a fire too large, though, or wander into one of the circles of towering redwoods that Granna Fee cautioned Noxy and her friends to steer clear of on training flights, and the forest's wrath would be as merciless as a winter storm.</p>
<p>Aft elbowed his way to the front of the small crowd and clapped his hands twice. &quot;Are they smugglers?&quot; he asked loudly without waiting for Indy to call on him.</p>
<p>Noxy saw rather than heard her mother's exasperated sigh. &quot;Not that the Gifted has said, no.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why in the saints' names were they trying to get through the pass this time of year? It'll be another month at least before the high trails clear.&quot; He crossed his muscular arms. &quot;Doesn't seem like something honest folk would do, is all I'm saying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My companions are not honest folk,&quot; the tiger sniffed. &quot;They are soldiers.&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd murmured again. &quot;Soldiers?&quot; Aft said disbelievingly. &quot;What were you doing trying to get through the pass? There aren't any rebels up here.&quot;</p>
<p>At that, the tiger finally deigned to look at him. &quot;There are, actually. It is my companions' privilege to serve the cause of the Learned Shudarga.&quot;</p>
<p>That brought gasps instead of murmurs. As a brilliant young scholar, Shudarga had written pamphlet after pamphlet arguing that Gandan's laws should be free for all to use. The kingdom's merchant-nobles had ignored her at first, then mocked her, but when she started organizing peasants and tradesmen to pool their money so that they could rent laws together, their laughter turned to anger. Arrested, she had escaped the previous summer and raised her flag in rebellion, attracting thousands to her cause. Then winter had come and news from the lowlands had slowed to a trickle, leaving the cloudherds with nothing to chew on but rumors.</p>
<p>&quot;Does that mean the king's army is going to come looking for you?&quot; Aft demanded loudly, putting a protective arm around his wife and ignoring Indy as she thumped the drum for order. &quot;Because if they do, these walls won't keep 'em out for long, and neither will we.&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger's tail twitched. &quot;I did not come to your village for its walls, honored, or to ask you to fight. My companions need help. You are their only hope---if you fear it will bring more trouble than you can chew, say so and I will be on my way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is saying we won't help,&quot; Indy said firmly. &quot;And as long as I'm reeve, nobody is <em>going</em> to say that.&quot; She raised a hand to forestall whatever Aft had been about to say. &quot;We can argue about the politics later. Right now, there's folk in trouble, and I won't have it said that the people of this village ever turned their backs on those that needed help.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Clap clap.</em> Granna Fee waited for Indy to nod at her before speaking. &quot;What about the <em>tralpa</em>?&quot; she asked her daughter. &quot;I expect he'll have something to say about us helping rebels.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy's smile was as cold as the distant peaks. &quot;We can ask him when he wakes up.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>The next five minutes were chaos. Out of the question, Aft growled. The law might forgive them giving shelter to a bunch of strays stupid enough to anger the forest, but flying off to rescue a bunch of rebels? &quot;It's not just us they'll punish,&quot; he said, glancing meaningfully at the bulk under his wife's winter coat.</p>
<p>And what would other cloudherds say if they heard that Stale had left people in the forest to die, Grappa Gas shot back. Pilots and saints, what would their own kin say when they got back from up the mountain?</p>
<p>The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones, punctuated by soft bings and bongs from the windchimes that hung from the eaves of every house. Little whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart as people overheard neighbors they disagreed with, or turned around to agree with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet another &quot;what if?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is going to go on forever,&quot; Noxy said sourly. &quot;They're all going to do whatever my <em>amma</em> want to do in the end---why don't they just get on with it?&quot; She, Sensy, and Rash stayed together in a knot on the sidelines, old enough that they hadn't grown bored and run off to play like the younger children, but young enough that the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.</p>
<p>Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a mustache. It had become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had told him countless times he ought to break before <em>someone</em> broke his stupid finger. &quot;What I want to know is whether we're going to get to go, or if we're going to be stuck here with the littles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we'll get to go!&quot; Noxy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;You sure about that?&quot; Rash raised an eyebrow, another annoying habit he had cultivated over the winter. &quot;Because your <em>amma</em>'s giving jobs to just about everyone except us.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy puffed an annoyed breath, biting off her &quot;of course I'm sure!&quot; when she caught Sensy's uncertain look. &quot;Wait here,&quot; she said with a scowl.</p>
<p>She strode through the crowd to the speaker's stone and caught her mother's eye. Before Noxy could speak, Indy said, &quot;Oh, and I think you've met my daughter, Probably Noxious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The honor was mine,&quot; the tiger rumbled, flicking an ear in what might have been the feline equivalent of a very small bow.</p>
<p>Noxy wondered if she was supposed to bow back, and was immediately annoyed at herself. Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a silly lowlander custom. &quot;Just call me Noxy,&quot; she told him. &quot;<em>Amma</em>, which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on? We can go and start getting them ready while everyone's still jawing.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well. &quot;Who said anything about you three going?&quot;</p>
<p>But Noxy knew her mother as well as her mother knew her, and had assembled her arguments as she crossed the square. They were definitely old enough---why, they were all going to be riding <em>real</em> clouds in a few weeks, not just the tame old pair floating in the cloud pen. And they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down the pass, and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do rescues, wasn't it? And---</p>
<p>&quot;Stop.&quot; Her mother held up a hand, not noticing or just ignoring the amused look on Granna Fee's face. &quot;You can go. But!&quot; she continued, &quot;But you do what you're told and nothing more, understood?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded obediently. &quot;Yes, <em>amma</em>.&quot; She had learned long ago not to keep asking for a whole orange when she'd already talked her mother into a half.</p>
<p>Somehow everyone eventually realized that they agreed with Indy's decision or were so outnumbered as to make further argument pointless. Even Aft gave in, grumbling that someone who hadn't lost his wits needed to keep an eye on things.</p>
<p>After that, it only took them a few minutes to gather what they needed. Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and they had lifted more than one tinker or trader out of a difficult spot. Coils of hemp rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen, and everyone kept a warm camelskin cap and some heavy gloves handy just in case.</p>
<p>&quot;You look ridiculous,&quot; Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the wooden steps to the mounting platform. He had sewn a pattern that he claimed was meant to be eagle's wings onto the side flaps of his cap during the winter, and had wrapped a bright yellow scarf around his neck that the last of the autumn pack traders had sworn was all the rage in Gandan.</p>
<p>Rash looked her up and down. &quot;Really? Because I think you look amazing. Excuse me.&quot; He winked and stepped around the speechless pair of thirteen-year-olds.</p>
<p>They were the last to arrive at the wooden platform that hung over the edge of the cloud pen. &quot;Ears all!&quot; Aft said loudly. He had changed into heavy pants, a padded coat, and a pair of soft boots, and his hair was pulled back in a thick club braid tied with a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar. &quot;You know how this is done. I'll lead on Pillow with the younglings as spotters and the Gifted as a guide. Gas and Fee, you've got Blue---you take Noxy with you. In and out, quick and simple, and everyone's back here for soup before you can sneeze. No adventures, right?&quot; He glared at Noxy, Sensy, and Rash until the three teenagers mumbled, &quot;No adventures.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; He walked to the end of the plank that stuck out from the platform and whistled through his fingers. When nothing happened, he muttered something about &quot;soggy&quot; and &quot;lazy&quot; and whistled again more loudly.</p>
<p>A hundred strides away and fifty strides below them, a foggy-edged blue-gray mass rippled and began to pull itself into something dense enough to hold the weight of a person. The second, smaller blob next to it followed suit. Side by side, Big Blue and Pillow drifted toward the villagers and the lone tiger waiting at the edge of the ravine. A clattering noise further along the ravine signalled that whoever Indy had sent to pull back the pen's spiderweb gate had started hauling in the bamboo chain it hung from.</p>
<p>Noxy watched breathlessly as the clouds approached, their leading edges rippling slightly in the wind. When Big Blue bumped against the ravine wall, Aft took three steps and jumped off the end of the plank.</p>
<p>Noxy leaned over the railing. One, two, three... Big Blue dimpled as the burly cloudherd tucked, flipped over, spread-eagled, and landed flat on his back. Gray waves rippled out across the cloud's back as Aft rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly. Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount.</p>
<p>&quot;Show off,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered beside her.</p>
<p>Granna Fee elbowed him. &quot;Gets it from his old man.&quot;</p>
<p>Something twinged in the back of Noxy's head. She blinked. &quot;Did you say something?&quot; she asked Sensy.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind.&quot; Noxy shook her head. &quot;Look, he's coming up.&quot;</p>
<p>Big Blue rose toward the platform, bunching into an evern firmer mass as he neared them. Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the cloud's back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.</p>
<p>A silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, cawing its displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away. Aft looked up and smiled the smile he only ever wore when he was on cloudback or holding hands with his wife. With a whoop he ran across across Big Blue's back and launched himself into the air again.</p>
<p>Rash whistled. &quot;Nice leap,&quot; he said appreciatively as Aft landed dead center on Pillow. &quot;And blind, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not such a trick,&quot; Noxy said dismissively, though she was secretly impressed. &quot;He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, but would you trust a cloud's eyes that much?&quot; Rash challenged her. &quot;Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out of what they say.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. She had realized early in their training that mind-speech was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash, or even for some of the olders who were already riding. She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing off. The only person she shared her progress with now was her grandmother, and she didn't even tell Granna Fee everything.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas made everyone wait until Pillow was only a couple of strides below the mounting platform before he let Sensy and Rash jump. The teenagers had been doing it since they were children, but the brief moment of flight and <em>poof!</em> as they landed still made them whoop just like Aft had.</p>
<p>Aft steered the cow out of the way so that Big Blue could take her place beneath the plank. Grappa Gas landed on him with a soft <em>thud</em>. Granna Fee tossed down two bundles of blankets. &quot;Your turn,&quot; she said to Kulbinder.</p>
<p>The tiger's ears lay flat against his skull, and his tail whipped from side to side. For a moment Noxy was sure he was going to refuse, but with a sudden burst of speed he charged to the end of the plank and jump. She and Granna Fee leaned over the railing.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh,&quot; Granna Fee said. &quot;I guess they really do always land on their feet.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em> Noxy winced and put her hand on the back of her head. There it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?</p>
<p>Her grandmother noticed her expression. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Noxy lied. One of the grownups' many rules was that no one should fly if they were sick, and she was <em>not</em> going to be left behind. &quot;Come on, let's see if you remember your lessons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cheeky,&quot; her grandmother said. Three quick steps and a little hop and she was gone, leaving Noxy alone on the platform. She took a deep breath, grinned, and sprinted for the end of the plank.</p>
<p>She landed just a stride away from her grandmother, who was still lying flat on her back on the cloud. &quot;Oof,&quot; Granna Fee grunted, rolling over and sitting up. &quot;He's not as soft as he used to be.&quot; Then she smiled and put her arm around Noxy so that her granddaughter could lean against her as she pressed her hand against Big Blue and closed her eyes. The cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the mouth of the gorge.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll take lead,&quot; Aft called back through cupped hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Really? How unusual of you,&quot; Granna Fee said just loudly enough for Noxy to hear. She steered Big Blue into position behind the smaller cow. As she did so, Aft took the ox horn from his belt and blew three loud notes, low high low. Indy blew an answering note as the two clouds passed through the gate and into the wide expanse of the pass.</p>
<p>Cloudherding is cold work, even in the summer. In the spring, in the mountains, when breath still fogs and the wind pokes its fingers through every loose seam and down every collar, it's freezing. As they passed through the mouth of the ravine, Granna Fee took a camel hair blanket from the nearest bundle and wrapped it around herself and Noxy, leaving only their faces exposed. Up ahead, Noxy saw that Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy said, he might be a goof, but at least he was a <em>warm</em> goof.</p>
<p>Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected. &quot;Saints and their inventions, but I love this,&quot; he sighed. He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden leg on so that it wouldn't poke into Big Blue, but a long scarf only slightly less exuberant than the one Rash was wearing was his only concession to the freezing temperature. &quot;Look, the condors are back in their nest! We should invite them them to visit some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're not really the most sociable creatures,&quot; Granna Fee said dryly.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas harrumphed. &quot;You just have to get to know them. I wonder if any of their chicks will be Gifted this year? That would be a thing, wouldn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>It had taken the tiger a day to hike up the pass to Stale Leftovers. The cloudherds covered the same distance half an hour, even with the headwind. &quot;There,&quot; Granna Fee said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas frowned, then looked at Kulbinder. &quot;I thought you said there were just a few of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fewer than we started with,&quot; the tiger growled. He had spent most of the flight crouched down to get out of the wind, his legs and tail tucked underneath his body. Now he stood and padded forward to join Granna Fee at Big Blue's leading edge.</p>
<p>The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose out of the forest like an island. A dozen drab tents huddled around a small fire. Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw a dozen men moving about, some propped against one another to stay upright.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas gave a low whistle. &quot;The <em>tralpa</em> really isn't going to like this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind him,&quot; Granna Fee replied. &quot;What do you think my daughter is going to say?&quot;</p>
<p>One of the soldiers spotted them a moment later. They were too far away to hear his shouts, but there was no mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms, or in the way his companions hurried to roust their injured comrades.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep your eyes wide,&quot; Grappa Gas ordered Noxy curtly. &quot;Forest might be happy to let us take them, or it might not.&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't. An angry voice cawed behind them, then a hundred more, and all at once they were surrounded by a flock of gray-shouldered mountain crows, each one an angry feathered missile with sharp claws and a pecking beak. Noxy screamed as a crow grabbed her hair. Another took hold of her collar and pecked her shoulder. She screamed again, swatting at them as Granna Fee and Grappa Gas yelled and did the same. She could <em>feel</em> their anger coursing through her veins.</p>
<p>The tiger's roar sent the birds wheeling into the air above them and hurtling away. Noxy slapped at her hair one last time, not quite believing the attack was over.</p>
<p>A faint shout from up ahead told her that it wasn't. Aft spun the end of a coil of rope over his head to keep them at bay while Sensy and Rash batted at any bird that came too close.</p>
<p>The birds swirled around them for a dozen heartbeats before veering away. Aft handed the rope to Rash and knelt to press his hands against Pillow. A moment later he looked up and shook his head grimly. &quot;She's terrified,&quot; he bellowed through cupped hands. &quot;Won't go any closer. We have to leave them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Underhells with that,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered. &quot;Fee---I'll get Blue down there. You 'n' Noxy get 'em loaded up fast as you can.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But---&quot; Granna Fee protested.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; Grappa Gas bellowed as they went into a dive. &quot;It's going to get bumpy!&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>They hardly said a word on the way back to Stale. The young soldier even fell asleep, snoring gently with his head on the tiger's flank. His companions watched the mountains go by, too exhausted to show more than an occasional flicker of interest. in the fact that the whole world was now spread out beneath them.</p>
<p>With her hand on Big Blue's back, Noxy could feel how unhappy the cloud was. It wasn't just that he was carrying strangers, or that those strangers were bleeding and miserable. When clouds died, they just spread out into nothing. The thought that something could end but still be there---that it could go from being alive to being like a rock or a log---made the canvas-wrapped corpses on his back frightening in a way that storm winds and lightning would never be.</p>
<p><em>Sh, sh, sh,</em> Noxy mind-spoke soothingly, stroking the cloud as if he was a skittish newborn camel. <em>Home soon, then rest.</em> At that moment, she wanted it just as much as the cloud.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas brought Big Blue down in front of the village gate where he had been contentedly whittling only an hour before. Wearily, the soldiers up slid off the bull's back to stand among the bright green ferns of spring. The waiting villagers came forward to offer them blankets, then stepped back, unsure what to do next.</p>
<p>Indy didn't let them stand idle for long---she never did. &quot;Get everyone up into the traders' hall,&quot; she ordered crisply. &quot;And get a couple of pots of stew going---and tea. Lot of tea. You do drink tea, don't you?&quot; she asked the nearest soldier.</p>
<p>Rash and Sensy came up the trail from the cloud pen, where Aft had taken Pillow. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Sensy asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm fine,&quot; Noxy lied. &quot;But those crows---that was horrible. I've never seen the forest that angry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never want to again,&quot; Sensy said, shivering.</p>
<p>Rash nudged her shoulder with his. &quot;Where's the tiger gone?&quot; he asked Noxy.</p>
<p>A terrified shout from inside the ancient walls was his answer. A heartbeat later the village <em>tralpa</em> stumbled through the gate, tripping over the hem of the flowing lowland-style robe he always wore (and occasionally washed). &quot;There's--- there's a--- Reeve! Reeve! What is <em>that creature</em> doing here?&quot; He snapped his fingers. A tiny spark sputtered and died at their tips.</p>
<p>&quot;Saints give me strength,&quot; Noxy's mother muttered. She caught her daughter's eye, sighed faintly, and then put on the smile she always wore when talking to people she didn't like and turned to face the king's official representative to the village of Stale Leftovers.</p>
<p>Scholar-Candidate Nangyal---he insisted that the villagers use the title, even though he was a decade past the age at which most candidates removed that qualifier from their titles---looked as though he had slept in his robe and only just woken up, which he probably had. Like the soldiers who straightened up when they caught sight of his official gray scarf, he had a lowlander's round face and near-black skin. But where they were lean, he sagged, and where the soldiers had only a few days of stubble on their shaved heads, his frizzy hair and failed beard were as unruly as the ferns he trampled as he strode over to Indy and glared at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Reeve, are you aware that there is an <em>animal</em> in the village?&quot; he demanded icily.</p>
<p>&quot;A Gifted, Scholar-Candidate,&quot; she replied. &quot;His name is Kulbinder. He arrived this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, why was I not informed? And who are <em>these</em> people?&quot; he continued, jabbing a finger at the soldiers. &quot;You! Sergeant! What are you doing here? Just look at your uniform---it's a disgrace!&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier who had been the last to climb onto Big Blue nodded. &quot;It isn't quite regimental standard, is it, honored?&quot; he acknowledged ruefully. &quot;Nothing a bar of soap won't put right, though. I'll see to it once my men are settled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Settled?&quot; The <em>tralpa</em> looked from the sergeant to his men and back to the sergeant. His sour look brightened to merely displeased. &quot;Well, <em>finally</em>. This is long overdue. <em>Long</em> overdue,&quot; he repeated, nodding agreement with himself. &quot;I've been writing letters for <em>months</em>. No offense to His Majesty, of course, but I don't think people realize just how strategically important this pass is. And the clouds---why, if those upstart peasants were to somehow gain control of them, there's no telling what might---&quot;</p>
<p>The sergeant cleared his throat. &quot;Actually, honored, it wasn't His Majesty who sent us.&quot; A lump rose in Noxy's throat as one of his men very casually positioned himself behind Nangyal, his hand falling to the hilt of his sword.</p>
<p>The whole village held its breath. One heartbeat, two... &quot;You're---you're <em>traitors</em>!?&quot; the <em>tralpa</em> spluttered. &quot;Here!?&quot;</p>
<p>His face screwed up as if he was having a particularly difficult visit to the outhouse, and for a moment Noxy thought he might actually manage to cast a spell. He had tried so hard when he first arrived in Stale two years ago, working night and day to master enough of the basics to pass the annual examinations in the capital, &quot;And be posted somewhere with <em>restaurants</em>,&quot; he was heard to mutter more than once. But nothing worked, and nothing worked, and now he spent most of his time alone in the biggest house in the village with his bottles and his broken dreams.</p>
<p>A moment passed in breathless anticipation before the <em>tralpa</em> gave up and pointed at the sergeant imperiously. &quot;Reeve! Arrest these men immediately!&quot; he ordered.</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; &quot;No!&quot; Indy and the sergeant said simultaneously. The sergeant shook his head almost imperceptibly at the soldier behind the <em>tralpa</em>. Obediently, the man slid his half-drawn sword back into its sheath.</p>
<p>The sergeant turned to Indy. &quot;Honored? If you don't want us here, we'll go, but we won't suffer arrest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody's arresting anybody,&quot; she interrupted in exasperation. &quot;Not today, anyway. No---with respect, Scholar-Candidate, these men are travelers, and injured, and more importantly, we need to lay their dead to rest before they ghost. Sergeant---I'm sorry, I don't know your name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dorbu, honored---Gandan's Eighteenth Dorbu&quot; the sergeant replied, dipping his head respectfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Sergeant Dorbu,&quot; Indy continued in a how-it's-going-to-be voice that left no room for disagreement, &quot;Do you promise that you and your men will take no action against His Majesty while you're our guests?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have my word, honored,&quot; the sergeant said.</p>
<p>&quot;And mine,&quot; Kulbinder rumbled, &quot;Since I am not, as the <em>tralpa</em> so quickly observed, a man.&quot; Noxy jumped. The tiger had padded up behind them all while they were talking, the boy with the scarred face a pace behind him.</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> stumbled backed a step, tripping over the hem of his robe once again. &quot;What? No! Reeve, I <em>order</em> you to arrest these men! And this creature! They are <em>rebels</em>! They are <em>traitors</em>! You can't trust them!&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of replying, Sergeant Dorbu unbuckled his sword belt and held it out to Indy. The reeve blinked. &quot;What am I supposed to do with that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever you want,&quot; the soldier said. &quot;And lock me up if it makes anyone feel safer. Just so long as someone looks after my men.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As I think I just said, that won't be necessary,&quot; Indy replied tartly. &quot;Let's just get everyone warmed up and fed, shall we? Then it will be time for dinner and then we can do right by your dead and then we can all get some sleep and sort this out in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> drew himself up. &quot;That is <em>unacceptable</em>!&quot; he spat. &quot;These men have taken arms against His Majesty! You!&quot; He pointed at Grappa Gas. &quot;In the king's name, I hereby appoint you acting reeve. Arrest these men and then arrest <em>her</em>!&quot; He swivelled his arm to point accusingly at Indy.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas had been stroking Big Blue's flank, mind-speaking to the old bull to calm him after their turbulent flight. He looked from the indignant <em>tralpa</em> to the sergeant to the reeve and back to the <em>tralpa</em>. &quot;Can't do that, honored,&quot; he said cheerfully. &quot;I have to get this old boy back in his pen.&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu's shoulders slumped slightly. &quot;Thank you, honored,&quot; he said to Indy, buckling his sword back on. With a grunt, he squatted and lifted one of the canvas bundles onto his shoulder. &quot;If there's somewhere we could...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll show you the way,&quot; Granna Fee said.</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> stormed and raged for a few moments longer, but once he realized that no one was paying attention he wrapped his robe and what was left of his dignity around himself and marched back the house that he shared with his books, his bottles, his failed attempts at magic, and his resentment of everyone and everything outside the distant capital.</p>
<p>Noxy barely noticed his door slam. Once the soldiers who were well enough had picked up their comrades' bodies, and the rest had been led through the gate to have their injuries tended to, and Rash and Sensy went to find spare blankets for the soldiers, she somehow found herself alone. Feeling somewhat deflated, she went looking for something to do.</p>
<p>Her mother was still organizing people in the square. Yes, the soldiers would use the trading hall, she'd already said that. Yes, the wounded too---where else would they go? And yes, there <em>were</em> more than a few of them, but there was nothing they could do about that now. Oh for the saints' sakes, of <em>course</em> they would eat beans. And no, she didn't know what the tiger was planning to eat, but she would find out.</p>
<p>&quot;There you are,&quot; she said when she caught sight of her daughter. &quot;Can you please go home and make some tea? Use all the honey we have left, and tell whoever shows up that I'll be there as soon as I can.&quot;</p>
<p>The water hadn't even boiled before Grappa Gas rapped on the door with his knuckles and entered. &quot;Hey there. Where's your <em>amma</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She should be back soon,&quot; Noxy said. She added a handful of dark brown leaves to the cinnamon bark and green cardamom pods already in the pot. It was an extravagance---the pack traders who brought such delicacies to the village wouldn't start visiting until the last of the snow had melted, which was at least another month away---but Granna Fee had always said that a sweet cup of tea was worth a thousand words.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind if I sit?&quot; Grappa Gas asked as he settled himself on a stool that was at least as old as he was and watched Noxy drizzle the last of the honey into the pot.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you find out?&quot; she asked after a moment.</p>
<p>The old man snorted affectionately. &quot;Just like your <em>amma</em>, aren't you? And your granna, too. Always thinking one step ahead of everyone else. You know, if your granna hadn't been so smart, I might've wound up being your grappa. I remember once when---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa!&quot; Noxy cut in, exasperated and amused by his teasing at the same time. &quot;Tell me what the soldiers said!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how do you know they said anything?&quot; Grappa Gas challenged.</p>
<p>&quot;Because they're a long way from home, and tired, and frightened even if they don't let it show, and want us to like them,&quot; Indy answered, closing the door behind her as she came in. &quot;And because I saw you talking the ear off Sergeant Dorbu on your way into the trading hall. Now, what did he say? And how in the saints' names did a bunch of the king's soldiers wind up <em>here</em>?&quot; She kissed the old man on his grizzled cheek and sat on the other stool.</p>
<p>For a moment all Grappa Gas could think of was how alike mother and daughter were. Noxy's hair was brown and wavy like her father's instead of straight and black like her mother's, and her nose sharper than was common among the mountain-born, but they had the same strong wills and quick minds. When Indy had turned ten, he had predicted that she would be reeve before she was thirty. <em>Better start telling everyone that Noxy's going to beat that,</em> he thought.</p>
<p>He slurped his tea, then cradled the warm mug in his hands. &quot;The sergeant said that they were posted over on the border with Lhabde. There's been heavy snow this winter, so they were stuck in their barracks most of the time and got to talking, and...&quot; He shrugged. &quot;One thing led to another, I guess. By the time the snow had melted enough that they can get on the road, some of 'em said they weren't going to fight their own neighbors. Their colonel didn't take well to that, so he hanged a couple of them, and that helped the rest figure out which side they wanted to be on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So why were they trying to come through the pass?&quot; Indy asked.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas shrugged again. &quot;They were supposed to be headed down to the capital, but the king's men hit them at the ford near Duck Droppings. They were split cross the two sides of the river when the attack came.&quot; For a moment his years showed on his face. &quot;He doesn't expect he'll see many of his friends again.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy glanced at Noxy. &quot;That doesn't go out of this house,&quot; she ordered. Noxy nodded, turning to the stove as the lid on the kettle began to whistle. She lifted it carefully with a pair of chopsticks to pour the boiling water into the teapot, then put the kettle back on the stove and set the tea on the table to steep.</p>
<p>&quot;Was there anything else?&quot; Indy asked.</p>
<p>The front door banged open before he could answer. Aft strode in and glared at Indy. &quot;What in the underhells do you think you're doing?&quot; he demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, good day to you too, son,&quot; Grappa Gas drawled, leaning back and lacing his fingers behind his head.</p>
<p>Aft stabbed a finger toward him. &quot;Stow that. Indy, this is madness. I don't like the <em>tralpa</em> any more than anyone else, but as soon as he gets word down the mountain that we've gone over to the rebels---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop,&quot; Indy said sharply. She stood up and gestured at her stool. &quot;Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. And then take a deep breath before you say another word. We have <em>not</em> gone over to anything. We are not taking any side in this, not as long as I'm reeve. Noxy? Go get the peeling stool from out back. Brush it off before you bring it in the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Aft glowered at her and his father a moment longer, then sat, the stool creaking in protest under his weight. Noxy hastily fetched the spare stool from the rear of the house and set it down for her mother, then poured tea as inconspicuously as she could while Aft ticked points off on his fingers. What would the village do if the king sent an army after the rebels? And by &quot;if&quot;, he meant &quot;when&quot;, because the <em>tralpa</em> was sure to be writing another one of his letters while they were sitting there, and this one would surely get an answer. They couldn't fight, not with most of the adults gone, and even once they were back, there weren't more than a handful of people in the village who'd ever swung a sword, not that they actually had any swords to swing. They'd be lucky not to wind up in prison, and even if they didn't, the village would be paying double taxes for the next hundred years.</p>
<p>&quot;So what do think we should do?&quot; Grappa Gas challenged. &quot;Turn them out? They wouldn't make it more'n a couple of gallops before they froze or the forest tore 'em apart. I can just hear what folk would say if we did that. Or maybe you think we can take 'em prisoner?&quot; He mimed swinging a sword.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough.&quot; Indy set her mug down with a thump. &quot;Enough, both of you. We have a stormload of trouble to fly through, and I will <em>not</em> have you two making it worse with your bickering.&quot; She stared into her tea as if hoping the tiny swirling leaves might spell out some answers. &quot;I know it's a big thing,&quot; she went on quietly. &quot;And I did think about turning them away, but Gas is right---they wouldn't even make it to Rancid. How would that make us look?&quot;</p>
<p>Aft scowled. &quot;What people think won't matter much once the king hears about this. No, wait, hear me out. Saving travelers who got caught on the mountain, well, we can explain that if we have to. But letting them stay here---saints and all their gifts, Indy, what'll they do to us? What'll they do to <em>her</em>?&quot; He jabbed his finger at Noxy.</p>
<p>&quot;And what about the tiger?&quot; he continued before Indy could reply. &quot;What are we supposed to feed it? Or should I ask 'who'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Disgusting Aftertaste!&quot; Indy snapped. &quot;I will <em>not</em> have that kind of talk about one of the Gifted. Especially not in front of my daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just saying,&quot; Aft muttered. He swallowed the last of his tea in one gulp and stood up. &quot;Just think about it, all right?&quot; He squeezed his strong hands into impotent fists, then turned and left without saying goodbye.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if he <em>did</em> eat some of us!&quot; Grappa Gas called after him. &quot;Maybe we'd have some peace and quiet around here!&quot;</p>
<p>He turned back to Indy. &quot;Don't worry about him. He's just worried about the baby. Everyone gets wound up their first time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Indy smiled. With their first baby due in just a few weeks, Aft and his wife Rind had stayed behind when the other adults left for the mountains to gather the village's herd. The double weight of becoming a father and not being up in his element had made him as fidgety as a young camel in springtime.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas drained the last of his own tea. &quot;It's good,&quot; he told Noxy appreciatively. &quot;Maybe wants more cinnamon next time, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll try to remember,&quot; Noxy promised.</p>
<p>Indy stood when Grappa Gas did. &quot;Will you stay for dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &quot;Thanks, girl, but I promised your mother I'd, um, peel her potatoes.&quot; He winked, ignoring Noxy's little 'eww' of disgust. Indy smiled and kissed him on the cheek again. He was humming as he stumped out the door.</p>
<p>Noxy waited until her mother said down again before saying, &quot;<em>Amma</em>...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sweetling?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy hesitated. She didn't know where to start. &quot;Do you think the king really will send an army after them?&quot;</p>
<p>Indy laughed wearily. &quot;Probably not a whole army. But they won't be here long enough for us to have to worry about that.&quot;</p>
<p>Mother and daughter sat in silence for a moment. Finally Indy stretched. &quot;So tell me, did you collect any spiderwebs, or did you and Sensy spend the whole day mooning after Rash?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Amma</em>! And how can you think about spiderwebs on a day like this? And anyway, nobody's mooning after Rash.&quot; She sighed. &quot;He and Sensy are hardly talking to each other right now. I think they had some kind of fight, but I haven't had a chance to sort it out.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mother shook her head. &quot;It isn't your job to sort them out. Maybe you should just---&quot;</p>
<p><em>Crash!</em> They jumped as something landed on the roof above their heads, sending loose cedar shingles skittering.</p>
<p>&quot;What in the names...?&quot; Indy crossed the floor in three steps and threw open the door just as a troll landed in the narrow street in front of their house. She yelped and flung herself to the side as the hairy creature lunged past her and scrambled up the stairs on all fours.</p>
<p>With a roar, the tiger burst into the kitchen and skidded to a stop. &quot;Which way did it go?&quot; he demanded, his ears back and his tail lashing.</p>
<p>The sound of a door banging upstairs answered his question before Indy could. &quot;Wait!&quot; she shouted as the tiger took the steps three at a time. &quot;Blast!&quot; they heard him roar. &quot;The blighter's gone through the window!&quot;</p>
<p>Indy slammed the door shut and stepped in front of it as the tiger raced back down the stairs. &quot;Let me pass!&quot; the tiger snarled.</p>
<p>&quot;What in the saints' names are you <em>doing</em>?&quot; Indy demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;He was spying on us!&quot; the tiger spat. &quot;Now let... me... pass!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; The mayor of Stale glared at him. &quot;This is <em>our</em> village, and you will <em>not</em> race around like a madman!&quot;</p>
<p>It was the bravest thing Noxy had ever seen her mother do, and for one horrible moment, she was afraid it would be the last. The muscles in the tiger's shoulders bunched---and then relaxed. &quot;Hardly a mad <em>man</em>, honored,&quot; he rumbled, as calmly as if he was commenting on her taste in teapots.</p>
<p>Whatever Indy might have said in response was forestalled by a tentative knock on the door at her back. The tiger twitched his whiskers. &quot;Are you going to answer that?&quot;</p>
<p>Indy waited precisely as long as it would take Noxy to count to ten in her head, then turned and opened the door. &quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>The young soldier with the scarred face saluted. &quot;Excuse me, honored,&quot; he panted, &quot;But I'm looking for---oh. There you are. Sorry, honored, I couldn't keep up. Did you catch him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; the tiger growled. &quot;It turns out that these houses have windows. Did you see which way the other one went?&quot;</p>
<p>The young soldier shook his head. He wasn't much older than she was, Noxy realized. &quot;Sorry, honored, I didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger's tail twitched. &quot;Reeve? Any idea why a mob of chimpanzees would be creeping around the village?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We call them trolls here, thank you,&quot; Indy said, her voice full of polite steel. &quot;They're our neighbors. And I imagine they were doing what any neighbor would do if a bunch of strangers showed up next door---having a look to see what's going on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There were some trolls up by the spiderweb orchard this morning,&quot; Noxy said, immediately wishing she hadn't when three heads turned to look at her. &quot;They stopped Sensy and me when we were coming back down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This morning? Why didn't tell me?&quot; her mother demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been kind of busy!&quot; Noxy said defensively. &quot;Anyway, they were all bigger than this one. I think,&quot; she amended.</p>
<p>The tiger's tail twitched. &quot;Big or small, they steer well clear of settlements in Thind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They do here as well,&quot; Indy said, beckoning the young soldier to come in as she spoke. &quot;We've had an arrangement with them for, oh, I don't know how long. They keep to the deep forest, we stay out of it, and every fall a few of their Gifted show up to trade whatever odds and ends they have for some dried fruit or candy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hrrm.&quot; The tiger's tail twitched again. &quot;If they saw soldiers on the road, would they tell you? Or us?&quot;</p>
<p>Indy shook her head. &quot;Only if they were in trouble, and even then they wouldn't do it if the forest was angry. As you discovered,&quot; she added to the soldier, who had come two steps into the kitchen.</p>
<p>On impulse, Noxy stuck out her hand. &quot;Hi, I'm Probably Noxious, but everyone calls me Noxy.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier blinked, glanced at the tiger, and then gave her hand a single firm shake. &quot;Private Thokmay, honored. Thank you for rescuing us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad we could help,&quot; Noxy said. &quot;And---I'm sorry for your loss. Your losses,&quot; she amended.</p>
<p>The soldier dipped his head. &quot;Thank you, honored.&quot; He glanced at the tiger.</p>
<p>&quot;We should see if the sergeant needs any help with preparations,&quot; he said, rising to all fours.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Indy said, her voice warm once again. &quot;Please let him know that we'll be there at sundown. And if there's anything we can do to help...&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger's boy stepped aside to let the great cat pass, then dipped his head to Indy and Noxy once again before following his master. Noxy closed the door behind them and let out her breath in a long whoosh. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;That wasn't scary at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mother sat back down on her stool and squeezed her daughter's hand. &quot;Hardly at all,&quot; she agreed. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's response was somewhere between a snort and a laugh. Her mother squeezed her hand again. &quot;Good. How would you feel about scrambled eggs tonight?&quot; She took down their frying pan without waiting for an answer and set it on the stove beside the kettle.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going to go and help them...?&quot; Noxy asked as she began to set the table, not knowing quite how to finish the sentence.</p>
<p>Her mother glanced at her. &quot;Help them send off their dead? Yes. You don't have to come if you don't want to.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. &quot;I'll come.&quot;</p>
<p>They had two eggs each atop the grilled parsnips left over from the night before, with stewed snow cabbage and a small onion chopped almost to mush. They talked sporadically while they cooked and ate, leaving sentences half-finished and changing direction like bats chasing bugs on a summer's evening.</p>
<p>When they were done, Indy pushed her plate away and reached across the table to squeeze her daughter's hand. &quot;You really can stay here if you want, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy squeezed back. &quot;I know. But then who will look after you?&quot;</p>
<p>They dressed for the cold. Noxy took the box of candles from the shelf beside the stairs while her mother carefully wound the embroidered gray scarf of her office around her neck. With a brief prayer to the named and nameless saints, Indy lit one of the candles and stood it on the table so that they would come home to light. They closed the door gently behind them, brushed their hands over the windchimes that hung from the eaves to set them ringing, and set off toward the square.</p>
<p>A handful of other villagers joined them on their way, Grappa Gas and Granna Fee among them, but no one spoke---the soft sound of windchimes echoing through the evening said everything that need to be said. Even the goofs in their pens were quiet, and the village's cats and raccoons too. <em>Probably scared of the tiger,</em> Noxy thought. She certainly was.</p>
<p>When they reached the square, they found the soldiers well enough to stand waiting, patient and quiet in the way of people who have met sorrow before and know that they will meet it again. They had cleaned their armor, or nearly, and what bandages were in evidence were fresh. Kulbinder and Private Thokmay stood a little to the side, the young soldier's hand resting on the nape of the tiger's neck. He withdrew it when Noxy nodded to him in greeting, but returned her nod. The tiger merely blinked.</p>
<p>In silence, the small crowd made their way through the gate and up the path that led to the village's worship circle. Sergeant Dorbu and two other soldiers had piled pitch-smeared logs on the heavy gray stone that lay at the circle's center, then laid the bodies of their fallen friends atop the logs. They stood at attention as people shuffled into a circle, their battle masks raised to show their stony expressions. No one spoke except the smallest children, who were immediately hushed.</p>
<p>Noxy scanned the crowd, hoping to see Rash or Sensy, but neither was there. &quot;Where's the <em>tralpa</em>?&quot; she whispered to her mother. <em>And where is Aft?</em> she wondered. The big cloudherd often led the villagers' Purplesday worship, but tonight he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&quot;Ssh!&quot; As the last corner of the sun disappeared behind the peaks, Indy nodded to the sergeant. Saluting in return, he took a flint from a pouch on his belt, drew his sword, and scraped sparks onto the nearest log.</p>
<p>The crowd held its breath. The first tiny flame hesitated a moment, then began to spread. Everyone exhaled with relief. There would be no unquiet ghosts to trouble the villagers and the dead men's comrades. The soldiers' spirits would rest.</p>
<p>As dark smoke wrote its message of loss and grief on the sky, Sergeant Dorbu cleared his throat. &quot;When I die, I shall give back to the world all that I did not do. All that I might have been and wasn't, all the things I lost and spent and wasted, I shall give them back to the lives that haven't been lived yet. That will be my thanks to those I loved, and to the world that gave me the life.&quot;</p>
<p>Around him, soldiers and villagers bowed their heads and murmured, &quot;That will be my thanks.&quot; In ones and twos they stepped forward to light candles from the funeral flames, then turned toward home. One of the soldiers wept openly and without shame. Noxy saw Private Thokmay wipe tears from his cheek and then straighten his back and square his shoulders, cupping his candle to shelter it from the wind so that it could in turn be his shield against the darkness.</p>
<p>It was as solemn a moment as she could remember, which is why her heart sank when they rounded the corner and saw the <em>tralpa</em> standing in front of the gate with a dayglass lantern at his feet, his frizzy hair combed and tied back, and his scarf of office folded precisely into place. In one hand he held a book so thick it was almost a cube. Tiny flames danced across the fingertips of the other, and Noxy wondered how many tries it had taken him to make that simple spell work.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; Granna Fee breathed beside her. &quot;Not now. Not <em>now</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>As the villagers approached, Nangyal puffed out his chest. &quot;Literally Indigestible, by election from its inhabitants and with the consent of His Majesty Denpa King Gandan made reeve of the village of Stale Leftovers, come forward!&quot;</p>
<p>Ten strides ahead of Noxy and her grandmother, Indy handed her candle to Sergeant Dorbu with a quiet, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She waited a moment for the soldiers and villagers behind her to come to a halt, and another for the whispers to grow still. &quot;This is not the time or place, Scholar-Candidate,&quot; she said, her voice carrying clearly on the cold evening breeze.</p>
<p>But the <em>tralpa</em> plowed on. &quot;As the king's voice in this place, I require you, Literally Indigestible, to answer to a charge of insubordination.&quot; He flicked his hand a couple of times to blow out the flames he had summoned and then opened his book, cursing under his breath and stooping to pick up the bookmark that fluttered to the ground. Tucking it under his arm, he raised the book with both hands to show a page that was almost black with dense print.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Scholar-Candidate, but that's a bit difficult to read in this light,&quot; Indy said calmly. &quot;Perhaps we could make some tea and---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As the king's voice in this place,&quot; the <em>tralpa</em> continued loudly, &quot;I require you also to answer to an additional charge of derelection of duty, inasmuch as you have---damn it.&quot; The bookmark slipped out from under his arm and fluttered to the ground again. &quot;Inasmuch as you have neglected a <em>direct order</em> to arrest those who have freely admitted that they are in open rebellion against His Majesty.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Indy could reply, Sergeant Dorbu stepped forward. &quot;Am I going to have to put this down, honored?&quot; he asked gently, raising his candle slightly, its delicate yellow flame protected by his cupped hand.</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> snapped his book shut. &quot;I do <em>not</em> hear the words of traitors,&quot; he said haughtily.</p>
<p>&quot;I see. Honored, could you take this please?&quot; The sergeant handed his candle to Indy, ignoring her startled protest, and in one smooth motion drew his sword and straightened his arm to point its tip at the <em>tralpa</em>'s heart.</p>
<p>The Scholar-Candidate's eyes widened. Noxy's heart skipped a beat. She had just enough time to think, <em>He really thought everyone would just do what he said,</em> before someone cleared their throat behind her and said, &quot;Excuse me, honored? If I may?&quot;</p>
<p>Ignoring the tiger's growl of, &quot;Not now, boy,&quot; Private Thokmay came forward to join the sergeant and the reeve. &quot;Did I hear correctly that you're the king's voice here?&quot; he asked, his voice carrying clearly like that of an actor on stage.</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> nodded jerkily, his eyes fixed on the tip of the sergeant's sword. &quot;So you're in charge of leases on His Majesty's laws?&quot; Another jerky nod. &quot;Well, in that case...&quot; The young soldier fished a coin out of his pocket. &quot;There's a law regarding delays in application of official regulations, isn't there---somewhere near the end of the section on procedures? I'd like to rent it, please.&quot;</p>
<p>He held out the coin. The pudgy man gaped at him. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to rent that law,&quot; Private Thokmay continued doggedly. &quot;Just for tonight. That will mean the reeve isn't breaking any of the others if she waits until tomorrow to arrest people, won't it?&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> looked from the boy to the sergeant's sword to the reeve and back. &quot;I---yes, I should think so,&quot; he replied weakly.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, honored.&quot; He paused. &quot;You have to actually take the coin for this to be legal, don't you?&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> swallowed, then snatched the coin from the private's hand, picked up his lantern, and scurried through the fortress gate. Behind her, Noxy heard the villagers sigh collectively with relief.</p>
<p>But not the sergeant. He slammed his sword back into its sheath and turned on Private Thokmay. &quot;Don't. Ever. Do. That. Again,&quot; he said, every word coming out cold, clipped, and clear.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, honored,&quot; Private Thokmay, startled. &quot;I just thought---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What you did is exactly what we're fighting <em>against</em>!&quot; the sergeant snapped. &quot;Those laws he was holding? They belong to everyone. Nobody should have to pay to use them---not here, not now, not <em>ever</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, honored,&quot; the young soldier said, standing at attention. &quot;No excuse, honored. It won't happen again.&quot;</p>
<p>His mouth snapped shut as Indy stepped in front of him and held out her hand to the sergeant. &quot;Give it to me. <em>Now.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu stared at her for a moment, then unbuckled his sword belt for a second time and held it out. Indy took it from him with an icy, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She handed it to Grappa Gas without looking at him. &quot;I will let your men keep theirs,&quot; she said, her voice colder than the mountain breeze, &quot;But only on the understanding that there will <em>not</em> be another incident like this one. Do we have an understanding?&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu dipped his head. &quot;My apologies, honored, I---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want your apologies,&quot; Indy said in a low voice that sent a shiver up Noxy's spine. &quot;I want you to say 'yes, honored'. Now, do we have an understanding?&quot;</p>
<p>The sergeant straightened up. &quot;Yes, honored.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Then let's all get a good night's sleep and hope that tomorrow is a better day for all of us. Noxy? It's time for bed.&quot; And with her back as straight as any soldier's, she marched past the sergeant and the tiger's boy. Noxy hurryied to keep up with, wondering if her mother had always been this brave and if every sword was as heavy and awkward as the one she was carrying.</p>
<p>Noxy had a dream that night. She often had dreams, or told herself stories in her head while she was waiting to fall asleep that as often as not turned into dreams. Sometimes, when her stories were particularly exciting, she'd mutter bits of dialog out loud until her mother said, &quot;Who are you talking to?&quot; and Noxy would say, &quot;No one,&quot; and roll over and pull the blanket up under her chin and close her eyes and carry on saving the prince from the magician or the magician from the prince or both of them from an avalanche.</p>
<p>But that night's dream wasn't one of those. She didn't swoop down at the last moment on a cloud moments ahead of a roaring wave of snow. She didn't do battle with an angry pack of lightnings armed only with her courage and a magic sword while Rash and Sensy and the rest of the village cheered her on.</p>
<p>No, this dream wasn't one of those. This one was troubled and strange. The tiger was in it, as large as a house. The crows were in it too, but they were skeletons decorated with feathers like the toys children made for All Ghosts' Night and they were pecking chunks out of the people around her who were slowly losing shape like weary clouds.</p>
<p>Standing in the middle of everything was the troll she had seen that morning. It---she---had the same silver-shot fur and the same long scar, but her eyes were like those deep shadows in the forest where the last of the winter snow could lie unmelted until midsummer. She waited patiently until the last of the crows had flown away and then raised a hand in greeting.</p>
<p>Heart pounding, Noxy raised her own, and woke. She lay in bed and listened to the windchimes outside her window and the soft, rhythmic snuffle of her mother snoring in the room below her. Once her pulse slowed, she fumbled among the lifetime of odds and ends on top of the two-drawer dresser beside her bed. Her hand closed on the little brass lamp her father had given her when she had first started reading. She hadn't set it out that morning to recharge it, but the thumbnail-sized piece of dayglass inside it still gleamed with trapped sunlight when she opened its cover.</p>
<p>She set it back on the dresser and fished under her pillow to pull out the knit dolls that lay there. Her father had made them when she was little, either to comfort her when she was sick or as a nameday gift or just because he loved her. She and Sensy and Rash had played with them when they were younger---they had been pirates and cloudherds and once even pirate cloudherds, which Noxy had declared ought to be a thing even if it wasn't.</p>
<p>She tucked them back under her pillow. Her room was still big enough for her to sit and gossip with Sensy or play a game of stones, but the last time Rash had joined them, it had somehow seemed much too small, and having Rash over by himself was---</p>
<p>She sighed. No matter what her mother said, she needed to talk to Sensy and find out why she and Rash were made at each other. <em>Tomorrow</em>, she promised herself, twisting the cover on the dayglass lamp to close it.</p>
<p>She held it in her hand for a second, wondering if the dayglass stopped shining when there was nowhere for the light to go or whether the light bounced around being reabsorbed over and over again. Maybe that's what dreams were---ideas bouncing around inside her head until they found a way out. She'd have to tell Granna Fee... in... the morning...</p>
<p>Moments later, the syncopated rhythm of two people snoring wafted through the little house.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noxy woke to the sound of thunder. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes and glanced out the window. The sky was dawn-pale, not morning-bright, and the thunder was Grappa Gas knocking on the door downstairs. &quot;Indy? Indy, are y'awake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just a beat while I get some clothes on,&quot; her mother called from her bedroom. Noxy threw off her blankets, pulled on the trousers and sweater she had dropped on the floor the night before, and hurried downstairs just as her mother opened the door.</p>
<p>&quot;They're gone,&quot; Grappa Gas said breathlessly. &quot;That idiot son of mine and the <em>tralpa</em>---they're gone. They've taken Big Blue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, names of the saints,&quot; Indy cursed wearily. She dragged a stool out from under the table with her foot and let her weight fall on it. She had bags under her eyes, Noxy realized with a shock---she looked like she hadn't slept a wink.</p>
<p>Her mother noticed her look. &quot;Get the kettle going, would you, sweetling? Any idea when they left?&quot; she continued to Grappa Gas.</p>
<p>The old man shook his head. &quot;Not long. I stopped in to see if Rind needed anything, and she asked if I'd seen him---said he was gone when she woke up, and she figured he was out getting kindling or the like, but he'd been gone long enough that she was starting to wonder. So I went looking for him and found this.&quot;</p>
<p>He held out a dew-stained sheet of paper. Indy took it and scanned it quickly as Noxy fed a handful of wood shavings to the stove. &quot;That idiot,&quot; the reeve said. &quot;That self-righteous, self-pitying <em>idiot</em>.&quot; She tossed the <em>tralpa</em>'s note onto the table and pinched the bridge of her nose. &quot;The <em>tralpa</em> is going to Duck Droppings to---what did he say?&quot; She picked up the letter. &quot;To denounce us for our complicity in treason,&quot; she recited bitterly. &quot;He must have talked Aft into flying him there. Oh Gas, what have I done?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy stuffed a last handful of wood shavings into the stove and hugged her mother from behind. &quot;It'll be all right,&quot; she said, her voice muffled in her mother's braids.</p>
<p>Indy patted her arm, then took a deep breath and shrugged her off. &quot;Thanks, sweetling. I need you to put your boots on and start waking people up---get them to the square. The soldiers too,&quot; she added bleakly. &quot;And Gas, get Rind here. I want to find out what in the underhells her husband was thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about the tea?&quot; Noxy asked.</p>
<p>Her mother sighed. &quot;I don't think this is going to be a tea kind of day.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy woke Rash first, then Sensy. Both were alone in their houses, their parents having gone with the other adults to gather the village's herd of clouds. She had to thump on Sensy's front door for so long to wake her that she wound up waking the elders in the houses on either side as well, but Rash yanked his door open almost before her knuckles hit it. It only took her a moment to tell each of them what had happened and send them off to start waking others. That done, she hurried toward the trading hall that took up one entire side of the village square.</p>
<p>The first thing she heard Sergeant Dorbu say when she arrived was, &quot;I'm sorry, honored. I'm so sorry for all of this.&quot; He had bags under his eyes, and Noxy wondered if he hadn't slept. Whenever a cloudherd died, Aft and some of the other worshipful villagers kept vigil all night---maybe the lowlanders had the same customs.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if we could unscramble eggs, we'd have more chickens,&quot; Indy said. &quot;But honestly, I don't know what we can do now. They have at least a couple of hours head start, and even without that, Pillow isn't as fast as Big Blue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then our race is run,&quot; Kulbinder rumbled. He was sitting on his haunches beside the sergeant with a tired-looking Private Thokmay at his side. &quot;With respect, honored, the men aren't fit to march right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;March?&quot; Sergeant Dorbu laughed wearily. &quot;Kulbinder, my friend, I doubt they could walk the length of the Princes' Parade.&quot; His jaw set. &quot;And even if they could, I've no right to ask them.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em> Noxy winced. What was wrong with her? And whatever it was, why did it have to happen <em>now</em>?</p>
<p>Then she felt something else, like a breath of wind through distant branches or the first faint whisper of Pillow's mind-voice two winters past when she had first been trying to mind-speak and had almost been ready to give up because no matter what Granna Fee said about being patient it just wasn't working and she knew, she just <em>knew</em>, she wasn't ever going to be able to do it and then suddenly she had heard the old cow, wordless and warm and every bit as patient as Noxy's grandmother. This felt like that, exactly like that, which made Noxy's gut go cold because people weren't supposed to be able to mind-talk with clouds unless they were touching them.</p>
<p>But the whisper in her head was real, and she knew that mind-voice as well as she knew the sound of Grappa Gas's wooden leg on the cobblestones behind her. She swallowed hard and mumbled, &quot;Excuse me,&quot; then hurried toward the steps nearest the front gate.</p>
<p>The steps lay flush against the old fortress wall wall. They had been built for Pilots, not human beings, so each one was as high as Noxy's knee and took her two strides to cross. Even after hundreds of years, the stones fit together so snugly that it was hard to tell where one ended and the next began.</p>
<p>She was breathing hard by the top. It was wide enough for three people to walk side by side, and the parapets along its outer edges were interrupted every dozen strides by slits, each one a slightly different shape for reasons known only to their makers. Half a dozen sturdy wooden stairs just in front of her brought to a square platform high enough for her to see over the top of the wall's outer edge. She shaded her eyes with her hand and looked north up the valley, already knowing what she would see.</p>
<p>There, coming around the first bend in the pass, was a faint smudge of white. It was Big Blue. She turned around and ran as fast as she could back to the square.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Amma</em>! <em>Amma!</em> He's coming back!&quot; She skidded to a stop on the cobblestones. &quot;Big Blue---he's coming back.&quot;</p>
<p>A dozen heads turned to look at her. &quot;What?&quot; the tiger snarled, his ears going back.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Big Blue,&quot; Noxy insisted. &quot;I just saw him from the wall. He's coming back.&quot; <em>And he only has one person on him,</em> she wanted to add, but there was no way she could have seen that, not from so far away.</p>
<p>Half the village crowded onto the platform overlooking the cloud pen to watch Aft bring Big Blue home. Rind stood next to Indy, stone-faced, with a silent, glowering Grappa Gas on her other side.</p>
<p>The big bull scraped wetly against the side of the ravine. Aft hopped onto the platform and gave the cloud one last comforting pat. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;This is more of a welcome than I was expecting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where's the <em>tralpa</em>?&quot; Indy demanded.</p>
<p>The cloudherd blinked. &quot;How would I know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't play games,&quot; Indy said sharply. &quot;Where did you take him?&quot;</p>
<p>Aft crossed his arms. &quot;I didn't take him anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then where in the underhells have you been?&quot; Grappa Gas demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;I went to tell everyone else what's been going on!&quot; Aft looked from his father to his wife to Indy. &quot;Got as far as the Three Sisters, but there was a pack of lightnings further up the pass knitting a storm, a big one, so I turned around. What's happened to the <em>tralpa</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's gone to Duck Droppings to tell the king's men about Sergeant Dorbu and his men,&quot; Indy said. &quot;He left a note---we thought you'd taken him.&quot;</p>
<p>Disbelief and anger wrestled briefly on Aft's face, and anger won. &quot;Me!? Why would I do that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know. Why would you go behind my back and fly off to talk to the rest of the village?&quot; Indy retorted hotly.</p>
<p>&quot;Honoreds, forgive me,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu cut in. He, Kulbinder, and Private Thokmay had been standing a few steps back from the line of villagers. Now he stepped forward. &quot;If you didn't take the <em>tralpa</em>, then where is he?&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas made a disgusted noise in the back of his throat. &quot;He must be on foot. The idiot must be trying to hike down on his own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through the forest?&quot; Kulbinder rumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;It's safe enough if you're sensible enough to stay on the paths,&quot; Indy said, her tone making it clear exactly how sensible she thought the <em>tralpa</em> was.</p>
<p>&quot;But it's three days on foot, and I'd be surprised if that pudgy goof has ever gone more than a hundred strides off a paved road in his life,&quot; Grappa Gas growled. &quot;If he trips and breaks his leg, we'll have the Pilots' own job explaining what happened to him.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy nodded. &quot;We have to go find him.&quot;</p>
<p>So it was that Noxy found herself picking her way down a side trail a few minutes later with Private Thokmay and the tiger in her wake. &quot;Show them the shortcut to the fishpond,&quot; her mother had instructed her as she sent people in twos and threes to search paths that the <em>tralpa</em> might have taken.</p>
<p>Noxy had nodded, still wondering how she had known that Big Blue was coming back. Two strides away, she'd heard Aft mutter an apology to his wife. &quot;I should've told you,&quot; he'd said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes you should have,&quot; Rind had replied fiercely. &quot;How're we going to raise this baby if we don't trust each other?&quot; Noxy had turned away, embarrassed.</p>
<p>The air was cold and damp in the forest gloom. Noxy rubbed her arms to warm herself as she walked, but Private Thokmay seemed not to notice as he studied the greenery around them. The tiger had disappeared into it almost as soon as they left Stale with a growled, &quot;Find what you can---I'll find you.&quot;</p>
<p>Private Thokmay raised a hand. &quot;There.&quot; He pointed the forest floor in front of them. &quot;See where the bush is trodden down? Someone came through here recently.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so,&quot; Noxy said, rubbing her arms more vigorously. Cloudherds learned how to read the sky almost before they learned how to read books, but woodcraft was mystery to her. Truth be told, she had never really liked being in the forest. The trees always seemed to loom over her. It wasn't too bad when the birds were singing, but when it was silent---</p>
<p>&quot;Why is it so quiet?&quot; she asked, suddenly realizing that she hadn't heard anything for the last hundred heartbeats except the soft pitter-pat of water dripping from the branches around them.</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Private Thokmay made a cutting gesture with his hand. &quot;Something's watching us.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shivered. &quot;Is it the tiger?&quot; she whispered. Private Thokmay shook his head.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced over her shoulder. They were only a few hundred strides from the village gate, but it felt like home and sunlight and safety were a world away. The forest didn't want them there. It didn't want their voices or their boots or the metal of the sword that was somehow in Private Thokmay's hand even though she hadn't seen him draw it.</p>
<p>She pressed the heels of her hands to her temples. What was happening? She couldn't be mind-hearing the forest---could she? She must be going crazy. It was too much---it couldn't all fit. Her head was going to burst.</p>
<p>&quot;It's too big...&quot; Noxy whimpered.</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Private Thokmay hissed urgently, his eyes wide.</p>
<p>Noxy put a hand on a nearby tree to steady herself. The bark was cold and damp but reassuringly solid. The little beads of sap under her palm were frozen nearly solid but still sticky. She took a deep, shaky breath. She was <em>not</em> going to throw up. &quot;I'm all right,&quot; she told Private Thokmay, smiling weakly. &quot;Just... just a headache.&quot; Somewhere nearby, a sapsucker chirped uncertainly. A squirrel chattered in response and then she heard a faint, frightened voice calling for help somewhere in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; she whispered to Private Thokmay. He held a fist up beside his ear, his eyes still scanning the trees around them.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what that means!&quot; she whispered angrily. &quot;Did you hear someone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; the young soldier whispered back. &quot;Now please, honored, be quiet. I'm sure someone is watching us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it's a someone,&quot; Noxy whispered, too quietly for him to hear. &quot;I think it's the forest.&quot; But that couldn't be right. They were on a trail, near the road that from the valley floor up to the village. There were stumps where trees had been taken, and they had passed the remains of a long-ago campfire---they were far away from the depths of the Herd of Trees that human beings were allowed to fly over but not enter.</p>
<p>The voice called again, fainter and more frightened than before. &quot;Come on!&quot; Noxy hurried down the mountain without waiting to see if Private Thokmay was following or not. She ducked low-hanging branches that dripped wetly down her neck whenever she bumped into them and scrambled over fallen logs in varying stages of crumbly moist decay. Shelves of mushrooms grew on the older ones, some as big as a kitchen table, and the ground under her boots was fragrant and spongy with decades of fallen pine needles.</p>
<p>A lightning-blasted tree leaned drunkenly across the path. She ducked under it and pulled up short. &quot;Sorry!&quot; Private Thokmay bumped into her and grabbed the tree to steady himself, and then said, &quot;Whoa.&quot;</p>
<p>The trail in front of them wound through the rough-hewn remains of a rock slide. Ferns, a scattering of salal, and a few dwarf spruce had found purchase among the mossy boulders, and an impatient little stream flung itself from one small pool to the next, each waterfall throwing spray into the air for rainbows to dance on as it splashed its way down to a larger pool below.</p>
<p>&quot;Help me!&quot; the <em>tralpa</em> shouted again. One glance was enough to tell Noxy what had happened. Someone had laid a log across the stream to connect one side of the path with the other. The <em>tralpa</em> must have been halfway across it when one end slipped and rolled away, leaving him perched atop the other end like a crow sitting on a fencepost. If he tried to shift his weight, the log would topple over and send him tumbling down the mountain.</p>
<p>&quot;You---don't just stand there, help me!&quot; the <em>tralpa</em> shouted angrily. His prized leather satchel hung precariously on a stub of branch sticking out from the log a stride below him. Papers, half a round of cheese, and the bright shards of several broken bottles lay scattered among the stones waiting hungrily below him.</p>
<p>Private Thokmay grabbed Noxy's arm as she started forward. &quot;Honored, wait. What are you planning to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Help, of course!&quot; she said angrily, shaking him off.</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot; Private Thokmay nodded at the log. &quot;One wrong move and we'll be lighting candles for him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can't just leave him there!&quot; Noxy protested. &quot;He'll freeze!&quot; The Scholar-Candidate was soaked to the skin and shivering, as miserable as he was angry.</p>
<p>&quot;I know, but one slip and---&quot; Like an actor who had been waiting for her cue, the log slipped down the mountain.</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> shrieked in terror, then shrieked again when the log jerked to a stop two paces below where it had been. &quot;Hurry up!&quot; he yelped in a strangled voice. &quot;Get me <em>off</em> this thing <em>right now</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're trying, honored,&quot; Private Thokmay yelled back, clambering over a boulder half his own height covered in damp-slick moss. &quot;Can you reach the branch on your left?&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> didn't even look. &quot;No! You have to come <em>get</em> me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, honored.&quot; The young soldier muttered something under his breath that Noxy couldn't hear over the gurgling of the waterfall. He rose cautiously to his feet and took a long step onto the next boulder. &quot;Can you get any closer?&quot; he asked over his shoulder as he started to unbutton his uniform jacket.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe.&quot; Noxy picked her way carefully around the boulders, clutching at a sword fern for balance as a stone rolled away under her boot. She stopped three strides from the terrified lowlander. &quot;I can't get any closer,&quot; she called to Private Thokmay.</p>
<p>&quot;Understood. Hang on.&quot; A second another long stride put him on top of a smaller boulder half-drowned by the waterfall.</p>
<p>Noxy's heart went into her throat. &quot;Be careful!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, honored,&quot; he muttered, &quot;I'm trying.&quot; He wriggled awkwardly out of his uniform jacket, revealing only a sleeveless vest beneath it. He was skinnier than Noxy had realized, and started shivering as the wind scraped across his skin.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to toss this to you, honored,&quot; he told the <em>tralpa</em>. &quot;When you get it, hook it over that branch and then swing yourself over to that big flat rock on your left, all right?&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> shook his head violently. &quot;You can do it, honored,&quot; the young soldier coaxed him. &quot;I know you can. Ready? One... two... <em>three!</em>&quot; He tossed his balled-up coat into the air.</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> leaned forward and reached for it. As he did so, the log shifted underneath him again. He screamed as it slid and kept sliding. Its bottom end caught on a stone. It tipped forward, and for one long moment stood upright with the <em>tralpa</em> perched on top like a bird sitting on a fencepost.</p>
<p>Without thinking, Noxy grabbed the nearest salal bush with one hand and leaned forward as far as she dared, reaching for the <em>tralpa</em> with the other and shouting, &quot;Jump!&quot; The terrified Scholar-Candidate hesitated for a heartbeat, then lunged for her clumsily as the log slipped one last time and tumbled end over end to crash to a stop against another boulder a few strides below them.</p>
<p>Noxy grabbed the <em>tralpa</em>'s pudgy hand as his boots scrabbled to find purchase on the slippery rocks. He clutched her sleeve with his other hand, and for a moment she was sure his weight was going to pull her over.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got you!&quot; Private Thokmay grabbed her collar to steady her. With a sound somewhere between a grunt and an angry yell, she pulled the <em>tralpa</em> toward her---</p>
<p>---and fell to one knee as the rock she was standing on shifted under her feet. The log's impact on the boulder below them had knocked it loose! Scraping, hesitating, and then scraping again, the rocks around them were starting to slide!</p>
<p>&quot;Honored!&quot; Kulbinder roared as he burst out of the bushes on the other side of the stream. &quot;Let go! You must get clear!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not...yet!&quot; Private Thokmay snarled through gritted teeth. &quot;Come on, come on...&quot; He hauled on Noxy's collar. Choking, Noxy let go of the salal bush, grabbed the <em>tralpa</em> with both hands, and heaved him up onto the rock beside her even as it tilted beneath her. The <em>tralpa</em> shoved her out of his way and scrambled up the path for safer ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Go!&quot; Private Thokmay let go of her collar. Noxy leaped off the rock just as it tipped over and started sliding down the mountain. Her momentum carried her three steps forward to trip over the <em>tralpa</em>, who was on his knees sobbing in the narrow path. He shrieked and wrapped his arms around the trunk of the nearest dwarf spruce.</p>
<p>Noxy spun around. Private Thokmay was on his feet, arms spread for balance as the boulder beneath him shifted one last time. He looked straight at her, eyes wide, and said something she couldn't heard as a thousand tons of rock began to slide down the mountain like a blanket off a bed.</p>
<p>There was no way anyone could have stayed on their feet as the rocks slipped and then tumbled around him, but somehow he did it. Somehow he managed to jump from one rock to the next, arms pinwheeling for balance as he jumped or skipped or took a long, almost casual step to the next.</p>
<p>Just as he reached the edge of the slide and took his last leap a rock the size of his head bounced off a boulder and struck him hard in the ribs. Spinning in a half circle, he tripped over a stray branch lying on the path and fell backward into Noxy's startled arms.</p>
<p>The tiger appeared out of the bushes next to them a heartbeat later and pulled up short. &quot;I presume this means you're all right,&quot; he rumbled, settling onto his haunches and ignoring the <em>tralpa</em>'s frightened yelp.</p>
<p>Private Thokmay rolled off Noxy and stood up. &quot;Yes, honored, I'm fine,&quot; he panted, his teeth chattering with the cold. He had scars on his arm to match those on his face, Noxy saw, four thin, parallel lines that looked fully healed instead of fresh.</p>
<p>Noxy clambered to her feet. &quot;Here, put this on,&quot; she said, pulling off her coat and thrusting it at him.</p>
<p>He shook his head stubbornly. &quot;I'll b-b-be fine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Put it on, boy---that's an order,&quot; the tiger said sharply. With a jerky nod, Thokmay took the heavy quilted coat and wrapped it around himself.</p>
<p>&quot;And you,&quot; the tiger continued, turning his head to the <em>tralpa</em>. &quot;Are you injured?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Injured? Injured!?&quot; the <em>tralpa</em> said indignantly. He had streaks of mud on his cheeks where he had wiped away his frightened tears. &quot;I could have <em>died</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well maybe you should have thought of that before you ran away!&quot; Noxy snapped.</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> pulled himself up to his full height. &quot;I didn't run away,&quot; he said indignantly. &quot;I was trying to do my duty because <em>your mother</em> wasn't doing <em>hers</em>.&quot; Then his eyes widened. &quot;My satchel! Where is my satchel!&quot; He pushed past Noxy and Private Thokmay to glare at the tumbled pile of rocks beyond them. Trees jutted out of the freshly-rearranged rock slide like the uncombed hair of someone freshly woken from a nap. The stream was already filling new pools and splashing from one to the next in new waterfalls, but there was no sign of the <em>tralpa</em>'s prized leather satchel.</p>
<p>He spun around. &quot;You---tiger! I need that satchel. In the king's name, I order you to---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In <em>whose</em> name?&quot; the tiger growled menacingly, rising off his haunches.</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> gulped and would have taken a step backward into the rock slide if Noxy hadn't said, &quot;Look out!&quot; He caught himself and looked from her to the tiger to Private Thokmay, and then to Noxy's astonishment plopped himself down on the path and began to cry.</p>
<p>&quot;I just wanted... I just wanted to do the right thing,&quot; he sniffled, adding another streak of mud to his cheek as he wiped angrily at his tears. &quot;I know you all laugh at me behind my back, but I do try, I really do, and I can't just sit in that stupid drafty house and pretend nothing is happening when you're all acting like, like <em>outlaws</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's first thought was, <em>Your house isn't drafty---it's the nicest one in the whole village!</em> What came out of her mouth was, &quot;Let's go home and get cleaned up. I mean it,&quot; she continued as the <em>tralpa</em> opened his mouth. &quot;You're soaking wet, you don't have anything to eat, the path is gone, and if we don't get him in front of a fire, he's going to freeze to death.&quot; She nodded at Private Thokmay, whose teeth were still chattering.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; the <em>tralpa</em> said sulkily. He stood up gave her an exaggerated bow. &quot;I'll follow you.&quot;</p>
<p>The trail home seemed so long that Noxy started to wonder if they had taken a wrong turn. The <em>tralpa</em> huffed and puffed but said nothing---at least, nothing loud enough for her to make out. The tiger stayed at Private Thokmay's side, dropping back or slipping in front of him when the path narrowed but always returning to his post. As they passed through the small clearing left by a giant cedar toppling over when Grappa Gas was Noxy's age, she fell in step on Thokmay's other side and said, &quot;I'm sorry about your coat. I can go look for it tomorrow if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>The young soldier nodded. His teeth had stopped chattering, but he still looked drawn. &quot;Thank you, honored. Here.&quot; He shrugged out of hers and held it out to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, it's all right, I'm---no, please, you need it more than I do.&quot; Which was only half-true---the wind had picked up and Noxy was ready to start shivering herself. But there was only one more uphill stretch of path before the gate would be in sight, and she could imagine what her mother would say if the soldier arrived shivering and she was bundled up and warm.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Private Thokmay repeated, wrapping her coat around his wiry shoulders once again. &quot;And thank you for...&quot; He nodded at the <em>tralpa</em> trudging up the rise in front of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank <em>you</em> for grabbing hold of me,&quot; she replied. &quot;I think they'd be lighting candles for both of us if you hadn't.&quot;</p>
<p>They walked the rest of the way in silence beneath branches that jostled each other in the rising wind. The storm that Aft had seen the lightnings knitting was coming.</p>
<p><em>Behind them, a leather satchel hung precariously from a slender branch. It might have stayed there until the wind shook it free, but a curious scaw spotted it and landed to investigate. The branch bent and bobbed under its weight, just enough for the satchel's strap to slide free. The branch sprung back up, tossing the startled bird into the air as the satchel dropped into the pond below with a small splash. The current pulled at it, turning it around in a lazy circle. As it slipped over the lip of the pond its strap caught once again on a stick. The satchel's weight dragged the stick forward until it stuck against the pond's edge, leaving the satchel rocking gently back and forth, the tralpa's letters still doubled-wrapped in waxed paper safely inside it.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Indy took one look at the bedraggled search party and ordered all of them to the bath house. &quot;No thank you, but I will avail myself of the sauna if I may,&quot; Kulbinder rumbled.</p>
<p>Afternoon was flirting with evening by the time Noxy was clean, warm, and dressed. She told her mother what happened, then told the story again for Sensy and Rash when they returned from their own searches, then told it to her grandmother and Grappa Gas.</p>
<p>When she was done she sat in silence for a few moment with the two elders up on the wall, looking west to where sheets of cirrus were gathering above the peaks. &quot;It's going to be a big one,&quot; Granna Fee said after a moment. &quot;We'd best get ready.&quot;</p>
<p>Stale was no stranger to storms. When bulls battled each other in the dead of winter, the snow fell so thick and so fast that people had to string ropes between the houses to find their way. And in the summer, when nimbus clouds that had stayed in the north to give birth flew south to rejoin their herds, the sky could darken in the time it took to sing a nursery rhyme. When that happened, the villagers knew it was time to tie their shutters closed and get the goofs indoors, because the rain was going to come down in sheets instead of drops.</p>
<p>&quot;I am from Thind,&quot; Kulbinder growled when Indy told him why she wanted the soldiers to stay in the trading hall. &quot;I have lived through monsoons. This could not possibly be worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe not, but I bet it'll be a lot colder,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Kulbinder sniffed. &quot;Storm or not, someone should be on patrol. But I agree, it would be best if the men stayed warm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How is Thokmay doing?&quot; Noxy asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>The tiger blinked slowly before replying. &quot;He is well,&quot; he said. &quot;As is the <em>tralpa</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>The sun had almost disappeared behind the mountains when the first sharp line of lightning sparked the far-off clouds. Granna Fee said a word Noxy wasn't supposed to know. &quot;Let's not dawdle,&quot; she said briskly, pulling another armload of damp laundry off a drying line and stuffing it in a sack. Children, grandparents, and everyone else who could walk hurried to ready the village, stepping around soldiers or shooing them out of the way as they watched the sudden flurry of activity with bemusement.</p>
<p>Noxy carried the last sack of laundry upstairs to her bedroom for want of anywhere else to put it. Her mother was chopping onions by the time she got back downstairs. &quot;Thanks, sweetling,&quot; she said, blinking away a tear. &quot;Can you do some potatoes? And see if the cheese is still fit to eat. I hope the tiger isn't too picky.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy pulled up short. &quot;The tiger?&quot;</p>
<p>Indy sniffled. &quot;Yes, he's coming for dinner. So is the sergeant.&quot; She swept a double handful of diced onions into the cooking pot with the back of the knife and started peeling what was probably the last knob of ginger in Stale. &quot;It's the polite thing to do,&quot; she continued without looking as Noxy opened and then closed her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, <em>amma</em>.&quot; Noxy set the loosely-woven bag of potatoes on the potato and began to scrub the skins off them with a piece of sandstone.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu knocked on their door just as the rain began to fall. Noxy had been expecting him to be in his uniform, but he had traded in his helmet for a plain goofskin cap that any cloudherd might have worn, and had left his sword behind.</p>
<p>Kulbinder padded in behind him while he and Indy were saying their hellos. He flowed up onto the chair across from Noxy and watched impassively as she swept the last scraps of potato off the table. &quot;He is sleeping,&quot; the tiger said abruptly.</p>
<p>Noxy jumped slightly. &quot;Oh. You mean Thokmay? Um, I'm glad to hear it. It's pretty dangerous, getting frozen like that. It happened to one of the goofs a couple of years ago. She got out of their pen and tried to get across the---um. It doesn't matter. I'm glad he's all right.&quot; She could feel her cheeks burning under the tiger's cool stare.</p>
<p>Her cheeks heated up even more when she saw Sergeant Dorbu's grin. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; he said cheerfully. &quot;He does that to everyone. Saints, I almost swallowed my fork the first time I met him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a spoon,&quot; Kulbinder corrected. &quot;And it was more than 'almost'.&quot;</p>
<p>And just like that the rhythm of the meal took shape. Sergeant Dorbu had a seemingly inexhaustible supply of stories about his foolishness, clumsiness, or bad choices. Indy asked just enough questions to keep the stories coming, while Kulbinder's dry comments provoked protests of innocence and occasional snorts of laughter. As she table a tray bearing grilled slabs of cheese, fried onions, and boiled potatoes, Noxy realized with a start that she was actually enjoying herself. The mood was only slightly dampened by the tiger sniffing at the cheese and then saying thank you, but it would probably upset his digestion, he would hunt in the forest after the storm was over.</p>
<p>Conversation became more serious after the dishes were cleared. The soldiers had been fighting almost constantly since they had declared for the rebels. &quot;Or getting to a fight, or getting away from one, or trying to get enough food in our bellies to keep us fighting,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu added.</p>
<p>&quot;So why did you chose her side?&quot; Indy asked as she splashed some dark mountain <em>rak</em> into a glass and passed it to him. Catching Noxy's eye, she poured a thimbleworth into another glass and handed it to her daughter. The pungent fumes tingled in Noxy's nose as she tasted it gingerly.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu rolled his glass between his hands as if to warm them. &quot;My family used to have land. Not much---really just a big farm with a couple of tenants to work it---but it was enough to keep us. Then one of our neighbors decided he wanted it. She honeyed up the local <em>tralpa</em>, promised him a slice of the takings, and...&quot; He spread his hands. &quot;By the time we got to court, she'd rented all the laws that would have saved us. We had a week to clear out after living their all our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That must have been horrible,&quot; Indy said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&quot;It is foolishness,&quot; Kulbinder rumbled. &quot;The law in Thind is not something to be borrowed for money like a bullock. There are rules for each station, and that is that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But then how does the king raise money?&quot; Noxy asked.</p>
<p>Kulbinder blinked slowly. &quot;The emperor takes what he needs when he needs it. It is...simpler.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simpler <em>and</em> fairer,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu added with a quiet intensity that hadn't been there a moment earlier. &quot;And that's what the princess wants. Laws should be there for everyone, all the time, not just for whoever has the most money on the day of a trial. And if that means a bunch of royals have to work for a living instead of renting out laws some king gave their great-great-grands way back when, that's fine by me.&quot; He drained his glass in one quick gulp. When her mother did the same, Noxy held her breath and swallowed the last of her own <em>rak</em>.</p>
<p>The thick black liquid felt like fiery smoke as it went down her throat. She clenched her jaw, but a strangled cough managed to escape. &quot;And that's enough for <em>you</em> tonight,&quot; her mother said in mock-disapproval.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, <em>amma</em>,&quot; Noxy said, gasping for air.</p>
<p>&quot;Here.&quot; Her mother pushed the empty kettle across the table. &quot;How about you refill that and I'll make tea? It sounds like the worst of the storm has passed, and a bit of air will help you clear your head.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded, not trusting herself to speak. She slipped her feet into her boots without bothering to do up the laces, pulled a poncho over her head, and stumbled out into the night.</p>
<p>Rain was still falling, but Indy had been right---most of the panicked clouds had passed, and the few stragglers chasing them were already east of Stale, heading toward the plains. She watched them for a moment, then closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Goof,&quot; she muttered a moment later. Of <em>course</em> she hadn't been able to mind-hear anything. What had happened earlier with Thokmay had been a coincidence. She shouldn't---</p>
<p>Something clattered in the narrow alley between her house and the yarning shed. Noxy opened her mouth to ask who was there, but stopped herself. What if the troll had come back? There was no reason it would, but there was no reason it would have been in the village in the first place.</p>
<p>She set the kettle down quietly on the front step of her house and tiptoed gingerly toward the alley. Holding her breath, she leaned forward and peeked around the corner, just in time to see a shadowy figure disappear out the other end. It was definitely a person, not a troll, but who would be out in the rain?</p>
<p><em>The soldiers,</em> she realized. It had to be one of the soldiers, except why would they be out in the rain either? Suspicious, she hurried to follow.</p>
<p>&quot;Ow!&quot; Ten steps in, her foot connected with a pile of cobblestones that she and Sensy had put there as part of some long-forgotten game. The stones clattered as they tumbled over. Cursing under her breath, she stepped over them, wishing that she had taken a moment earlier to do up her laces. Some of the broken cobbles had sharp edges, and if she lost a boot now, she'd never catch up.</p>
<p>She reached the other end of the alley just in time to see the shadowy figure disappear around the edge of the tannery. She hesitated for only a moment before sprinting after it, her boots splashing in shallow puddles of rainwater. Whoever she was chasing was bound to hear her---the only question was whether she could catch them first.</p>
<p>She rounded the corner of the tanning shed a moment later. Her quarry was nowhere to be seen. &quot;Rot,&quot; she cursed. Left toward the trading hall, straight on toward the square, or right toward the vegetable patches and the gate?</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em> She shrieked with surprise as a bolt of lightning split the sky, then stomped her foot, angry at herself, the rain, and the world in general. She'd lost them. And by the time she got back, her mother was sure to give her the &quot;what took you so long?&quot; look that she hated so much.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em> Another bolt of lightning left a dazzling scar on the night. That one had been close, she realized uneasily---too close. The lightnings must be nipping at the clouds that had fallen behind their herd. She was suddenly glad that she wasn't airborne. She had only ever been on one night flight, when Granna Fee took her up on her nameday when she turned ten to show her a passing star.</p>
<p><em>CRACK! BOOM!</em> Noxy shrieked as the third bolt of lightning struck the weather duck spinning madly next to the fortress gate and shattered its wooden pole. Splinters flew in all directions to clatter off roofs and cobblestones.</p>
<p>One smoking scrap bounced off a chimney and clattered through a window whose shutter had been left untied. As Noxy blinked to clear the after-dazzle of the lightning strike from her eyes, the sheets of dried moss that the wood had landed in began to smolder.</p>
<p>A door banged open. &quot;Saints!&quot; Aft hurried over to Noxy. &quot;Are you all right? What in the underhells are you doing out in this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Amma</em> wanted me to fill the kettle,&quot; Noxy said stupidly. She shook her head. &quot;It---the lightning hit the weather duck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can see the lightning hit it,&quot; Aft said testily. He took her by the shoulders and peered into her eyes, then relaxed slightly. &quot;You'll be all right. Just a bit of a scare. Come on, let's get you back to---wait.&quot; He sniffed. &quot;What's burning?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy grabbed his arm and pointed. &quot;There! Upstairs!&quot; A bright lick of flame was suddenly dancing in a window. Another joined it as the familiar herby smell of burning moss caught in Noxy's nostrils.</p>
<p>&quot;Get your mother!&quot; Aft ordered, then cupped his hands around his mouth. &quot;Fire! Fire! Fire!&quot;</p>
<p>The village was lucky. That's what everyone told themselves afterward. They were lucky that the rain had made everything so wet, that there had been so little moss left to burn, that Aft had spotted the fire so quickly. They were lucky the soldiers had been there to fill and pass buckets---with most of the adults gone, well, the elders and children would have done the best they could, but things could have been a lot worse.</p>
<p>&quot;But what were you doing <em>there</em>?&quot; Indy demanded as she and her daughter walked home arm in arm. &quot;You were just supposed to refill the kettle!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I saw something, like a troll.&quot; Noxy shook her head. &quot;I didn't get a good look at it.&quot; Which wasn't exactly a lie, but was an uncomfortable distance from the truth. The hooded figure had definitely been a person, but a bit short for an adult. And as the soldiers had arrived to help with the fire, only one of them had been the height of the figure she had seen. But why would Thokmay have been out in the rain when he could have been at dinner? And what had he been doing in the alley beside her house?</p>

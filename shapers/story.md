A thousand years ago,
the Makers created dozens of hybrid species,
then vanished,
leaving behind half-human creatures with strange powers,
robots in need of parts and purpose,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.
This 35,000-word story for middle grade children (ages 8-10)
is set in that world.

        -   "This now appears able to reply.  This is part of a sneak attack on Location Six Bitty Six, also referred to as 'Rusty Bridge'."
        -   Children: "Attack? When?"

        -   Bot: "It does not like being attacked."
        -   Gumption: "But you *have* to come with us."
        -   Bot (slowly): "It...does not have to do anything any more.  It can *choose* again."
        -   Wheels away at high speed (surprises them with its wheel).

    -   Mama Roo doesn't want to listen: "You really hurt your sister's feelings."

        -   Mama Roo: "You have to come with us!"

    -   Smarty Leaf takes a stance and gestures
    -   The earth opens up and the bot's front tread gets caught
        -   It tries to lever itself out with its enormous arms
    -   Smarty Leaf gestures again to create potholes and ridges to block the half-dozen smaller bots
        -   "Go!  Run!" he orders the Roos and Gumption
    -   Villagers are gathering
        -   Scraps of armor
        -   Axes for hacking, metal poles to jam in limbs

    -   A brick strikes the bot hard, then another and another
    -   It drops Gumption and retreats, shielding the antenna unit on its side
    -   "Get that one!" Smarty Leaf yells at the villagers
    -   The bots retreat, but Sindy and two grownups have been caught!

## Quotes

"Because there used to be a rusty bridge here," Dickety said slowly.
"We tried to repair it but we did not have parts."
Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think.
"Searching...
Yes.
It fell down.
I remember."

"My grandmother is barely out of her egg when it happens,"
Smarty Leaf confirmed in a slow whisper.
"It is winter.
There is a terrible storm,
much wind,
much ice.
When the bridge comes crashing down,
people say,
the Makers are angry,
we should leave this place,
but others say no,
this is our home,
we will make our own bridge."

"Because if we clean up this mess and put things back the way they were
then the Makers will come back and everything will be *better*,"
Tasercase hissed.
"No more rust.
No more oh, I regret, we do not have that part."
It waved its mis-matched manipulators for emphasis.

---

"That is just phase one of its plan," Dickety said.

Smarty Leaf sighed.
"Why do villains' plans always have phases?
Why can't they just get on with it and do some evil?"

## Notes

-   Use "they" as the only singular pronoun, rather than "he" or "she"
    -   "If they wants to do it..." (singular form of verb)
-   Use "it" for bots, who refer to themselves as "it"

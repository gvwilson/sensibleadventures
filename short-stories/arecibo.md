  <h1>Arecibo Mon Amour</h1>
  <h2>Greg Wilson</h2>
</div>

**Wurdi Youang / Actual minus 12,000 years**

She gave up her name long ago.
It was too heavy to carry as deep into the Dreaming as she needed to go.
She missed it at first,
but everyone who knew her by that name is dead now,
and it amuses her when others call her the Old Woman behind her back.
At some point,
she really ought to tell them that being mostly blind doesn't affect her hearing...

Footsteps crunch on the stream's gravel bank.
She sighs as the fish she was hoping to catch darts away.
"Who's there?" she asks,
the stream caressing her knees as she turns to face whoever has frightened her dinner away.

"It's Wharru," the young man says.
"There's a stranger in camp."
He is one of the new arrivals,
still thin and angry after his long trek from the drowning lands.
His clan lost their farms to the ever-rising sea,
and many were killed or enslaved.
It will be many years before he is ready to let go of that weight,
but he has helped her realign some of the stones without complaint
and doesn't snore or fart as much as some of the others.

"From down below?" she asks,
sloshing through the stream to join him.

"I don't think so."
Wharru hesitates.
"He's not like any real people I've ever seen.
Alinta thinks he might be a bad spirit."

"Feh."
The old woman picks up the walking stick and skin bag
that together are half of everything she can call her own.
"Alinta thinks *everyone* is a bad spirit.
Come on, let's go meet them."

The stranger isn't in camp.
"I told him to wait for you,"
Alinta says without preamble,
her voice as sharp as the stone knife in her hand.
"I told him it's a powerful place,
you shouldn't go there without her,
you'll make the ancestors angry,
but no,
*he* wanted to see the *sunset*."
She sets aside her knife,
grabs the feet of the gweela she is dressing with one hand,
and pulls hard with the other.
The bird's skin comes off 
with a sound that never fails to make the old woman's stomach turn.

The old woman sighs to herself.
The half-dozen people doing chores within earshot have paused their conversations
to listen to Alinta.
They will follow her once the old woman joins the ancestors,
and in her heart,
the old woman knows that will be the end of the stones.

She jerks her chin at the dripping carcass in Alinta's hands.
"Enough there for company?"

Alinta scowls.
"Hardly enough for *us*."

The old woman nods.
"Well, do what you can to stretch it.
Come along."
She digs her elbow into Wharru's ribs.
"Let's go see what this evil spirit of yours wants."

They walk side by side through the long shadows beneath the gum trees.
The old woman has been going up and down this part of the mountain for almost thirty years,
and takes quiet pleasure in thinking that the packed earth is
echoing her own footsteps back at her.
Birds and insects fill the forest with sound,
and once something larger makes the bushes rustle.
Wharru hesitates but the old woman pushes on.
A thylacine wouldn't attack two people together,
and no one has seen a marsupial lion for years.

They reach the field of stones just as the sun is about to kiss the horizon.
There isn't a cloud in the sky,
and if the stranger hadn't been there the old woman would put Wharru to work
sighting along the stones
and marking new positions for them.

But the stranger *is* there,
and even with eyes half-blinded by years of looking too closely at the sun,
the old woman thinks that for once Alinta might be right.
He is taller than anyone the old woman has ever seen
and completely hairless.
An angry young scar runs from his left temple almost to the back of his head,
rough and red against his near-black skin.

He turns as Wharru and the old woman approach him.
She blinks.
His little man is as small as a baby's and he has no bag at all that she could see.

She clears her throat to greet him,
but before the words could leave her mouth he says,
"It does not measure well enough."

Wharru stiffens beside her at the stranger's rudeness.
"Show respect," he says sharply.

She puts a cautionary hand on his arm.
"What do you mean, not well enough?"

The stranger gestures at the oval of basalt that has taken the old woman a lifetime to assemble.
There are exactly one hundred and twenty one stones,
each with a name known only to the old woman and whoever helped her place it.
She could pick some up one-handed,
but others took two people and a wooden travois to move,
and each of the waist-high trio at the oval's sunset end
needed a year of hard work to haul up the mountain and put in place.

"I need to know..."
The stranger pauses and blinks rapidly several times.
"This language does not have the words.
I need to know a moment."
He gestures at the scar on his head.
"My people can only hear me at some moments,
but I am damaged.
I do not know when those moments are any more.
I must add to find them.
I need to measure to add,
but this does not measure well enough."

The old woman clucks her tongue.
"I don't understand.
Do you want to add a stone?"
Is part of his spirit lost in the Dreaming?
She has seen it before.
A stone struck a man on the head.
When he woke two days later
he moved slowly and was confused by the simplest things.

The stranger shakes his head.
"No.
'Add' is not right.
I need to---this language does not have the words.
I need to count the spaces between the stars to know when my people will be able to hear me.
What you have built does measure well enough.
It is of no use."

"It is of great use!" Wharru says hotly.
"It tells us when the seasons will turn and what path the moon will take.
It tells us when the ancestors are closest to us!"

The stranger does not reply to that.
He just looks at the old woman.
*He knows,* she realizes.
He knows the same thing she knows,
that there are patterns in the stars and the lights that wander among them,
and that those patterns *mean* something.

"I must look elsewhere," the stranger says abruptly.
With nothing more than that he starts to walk past them.

Wharru catches his arm.
"Are they all so rude where you come from?" he demands.

"Wharru, don't," the old woman protests,
but the young man ignores her.
He fought and killed on his way to the mountain,
and in that sunset moment she can see his battles in the way he shifts his weight,
ready to strike or to fend off a blow.

But that blow never comes.
With a rasping roar,
the lion that had crept closer while they were distracted
bursts out of the trees behind them.

The old woman screams as the lion knocks her to the ground.
A dazzling pain shoots up her spine as her hip breaks,
then something cracks and the lion goes limp.
The stranger has broken its neck with his bare hands
as easily as someone might break a dry twig.

Wharru runs ahead to tell the others what has happened
while the stranger carries the old woman down the mountain as if she were a baby.
She passes out several times,
only to be dragged back into the world by the agony in her hip.
"Who *are* you?" she asks in a moment of lucidity.

The stranger glances down at her.
"I don't remember."
When they reach camp he sets her down gently
and walks away without another word.

*Later,
Alinta pokes at the lion's protruding ribs
and says it must have been desperate with hunger.
It is the last lion they ever see---the last one *anyone* ever sees.
She makes a cloak from its pelt,
but it is lost in a flood many years later and many miles away.
The old woman lives another season,
but is never able to go back up the mountain to track the sun and moon and stars with her stones.
She wonders sometimes who the stranger was
and whether he ever found a way count the spaces between the stars.*

**Chankillo / Actual minus 3400 years**

As a child,
Second Bird's diet consisted of maize, beans, the occasional roasted guinea pig,
and his grandfather's stories of the war.
The First People rose up against the highlanders' god-king many times.
Each rebellion ended the same way,
with entire families staked out in the desert
and ever-harsher conditions for the survivors.

"So we wept and we *learned*," Fast Rock says,
grunting the last word as he turns over a spadeful of damp soil.
He and Second Bird have been clearing this irrigation channel for nine days.
It is slow, slippery, back-breaking work,
but Second Bird doesn't mind:
all of the other chores are just as hard,
and he secretly enjoys his grandfather's stories.

Fast Rock drives his spade into the ground again.
"The trick was,"
heave,
"We all had,"
heave,
"To rise,"
heave,
"together."
He pauses a moment to wipe sweat from his brow
while Second Bird drags the reed basket of soil out of the way
and pushes an empty one into place.
One more basket and they will trade places.
Four more after that wwill make eight for them to carry a hundred strides
to fill the gap where the riverbank had given way.

The numbers dance in Second Bird's head.
They have made six such journeys so far that day
and will make another eight before the sun sets.
Six plus eight is ten with four.
Ten with four upon itself nine times is five twenties with six.
If they are half done---he glances at the river to check yet again---then yes,
it will have taken ten twenties with ten and two trips to finish.
At eight baskets a trip,
that will be---

The ground shakes.
Ripples dance across the flat stinking water in the irrigation channel.
Someone shouts a warning two channels over.
Someone else screams.

"Grandfather!"
He grabs Fast Rock's outstretched hand and pulls the old man up out of the channel.
The spade whacks his shin.
Later,
he will realize that it cut him,
and will go back and burn herbs to cleanse the ground where his blood spilled,
but at that moment all he can think is, *The world is ending.*

Dry soil loosened by the earthquake slumps into the canal,
undoing all of their work.
Fast Rock stares at it for a moment,
then draws the knife that always hangs at his waist.
"Come with me!" he orders.

"Where are we going?" Second Bird asks,
running after him.

"The evil one," Fast Rock says grimly.
"He must not escape."

Every handspan of green land was a gift from the gods.
Even the highlanders understood that,
and built their villages where the green ended and the hard dry desert began.
Most of those villages are empty now,
home only to wild creatures and ghosts.
Second Bird has ventured into the nearest one on a dare,
marveling at the carved stones and at streets wide enough for six people to walk side by side.
He has never gone to the center,
though,
and neither have any of the other children.
Only the old men go there,
and even they only go in pairs.

Another building has collapsed.
Second Bird counts the tumbled stones at a glance.
"Grandfather---" he begins.

"Good," the old man pants,
slowing to a walk.
He gestures with his knife.
"The sooner...
they come down...
the sooner...
our gods will come back."
And end the drought,
he doesn't add.
He doesn't need to:
every one of the First People's prayers has begged for that for six long years.

They come around a corner and face-to-face with a nightmare.
The highlanders' nameless god-king stands in front of the collapsed wall
of the storehouse where the First People imprisoned him.
Two old men stand opposite him,
spears clutched in their hands.

Second Bird grabs his grandfather's arm.
"Wait," he pleads.
The god-king is faster and stronger than any mortal being.
It took a dozen men to subdue him,
and the only one to survive his wounds from that battle
cannot beat him with only a knife.

Fast Rock smacks his grandson's hand away and advances slowly,
his knife held low.
One of the guards shifts to the side to make space for him
without taking his eyes off the god-king.

"So," Fast Rock says after a moment.
"What now?"

The god-king is a head taller than anyone Second Bird has ever seen,
with skin like charcoal and an old scar on the left side of his head.
Naked,
thin from years of starvation,
and covered in dust,
he is still more frightening than Second Bird has ever imagined.

"I said, what now?" Fast Rock demands.

The god-king blinks as if waking.
"I need to see the stars," he says abruptly,
and then turns and walks away.

The two guards look at Fast Rock helplessly.
"Get help," the old man orders,
taking the nearest one's spear.
"Get *everyone*.
It's time we ended this."

"But---"

"Now!"
he bellows,
and the guard takes off at a run.

Fast Rock bares his teeth.
"Come on."

They follow the god-king into the desert.
At first Second Bird thinks he is headed for the fortress that the highlanders built
when they first swept down over the valleys,
but he walks past it without a glance.
That leaves the towers,
thirteen of them in a row on a ridge looking west,
each one built at a cost of dozens of lives.

Others join them,
some carrying spears,
others with whatever tools they were using when the earth shook.
Two men have thought to bring a net like the one Fast Rock and his companions used
to ensnare the god-king on the day of the rising,
and an old woman has a pouch of herbs and a needle and thread for wounds.

Ten twenties of twenties of strides bring them to the stairs leading up to the first tower.
Second Bird counts each step automatically
and wonders for a moment if the number being so clean is some kind of sign.

The god-king stands alone at the top of the tower.
"Should we set an ambush?" one of the men carrying the net hisses at Fast Rock.

The old man snorts.
"How?"
There is no way to get above the tower stairs and nothing to hide behind.

He gestures at the nearest men.
"Spread out.
When he comes down, you three get behind him, but wait for my word.
We must all attack at once."

"Attack?"
one man says incredulously.
"*Him?*"

"He has been in prison longer than my grandson has been alive,"
Fast Rock says curtly.
"He will be weak."

"Doesn't *look* weak," the man says under his breath,
but he takes a position.

They wait.
And wait.
Finally Fast Rock cups his hands around his mouth.
"What are you doing up there?" he shouts.

People gasp.
Monster or not, you don't yell at gods.

But he replies.
"I am looking at the stars,"
he calls down.

"Bit early for that, isn't it?" Fast Rock yells up.
"I mean, wouldn't it be better to wait until they're actually there?"

"The stars are always there."
There is a moment of silence.
"It is good to see them again."

Second Bird looks questioningly at his grandfather.
The old man shrugs,
then tenses as the god-king comes down the steps.

The men shuffle into a semi-circle around him
when he reaches the bottom.
The god-king looks past them at the thin green ribbon of life running through the desert.
"These are hard times for you,"
he says.

Fast Rock shrugs.
"Not as hard as your time was.
But it'll get better."

The god-king shakes his head.
"No, it will not.
This is a new---" he hesitates.
"Balance.
A new balance of long weather.
This valley can no longer sustain as many people as my work needs.
I must build my tools elsewhere."

He takes a step forward,
pulling up short when the tip of Fast Rock's spear touches his chest.
"Your 'tools'?" the old man snarls.
"Is that what you call this?
We *died* here, monster.
We died and died and died to build---what?"

"A way to measure the stars,"
the god-king says evenly.
"I need to measure them very exactly to know when I can speak with my people."

And just like that a lifetime of puzzle pieces click together in Second Bird's head.
"The solstice," he breathes.

The god-king swivels his head to look at Second Bird in a motion more lizardly than human.
"Yes.
Knowing the exact moment of the solstice is a start,
but only a start.
These tools are not good enough to do more."
His wave takes in the towers,
the people,
and the entire river valley.

"Not *good* enough?" Fast Rock snarled.
"We have *bled*.
We have *died*.
We have bowed our heads for a hundred years,
and you say it's not *enough*?"
He lunges.

The god-king slaps the spear-thrust aside as if swatting a fly.
One of the men behind him takes a step forward.
Without even looking,
the god-king raises a hand to point straight at him.
"Do not," he says flatly.
Further around the circle,
the two men with the net shuffle their feet but make no move.

Fast Rock spits at the god-king's feet.
"So now what?
Are we to be your slaves again?"

The god-king shakes his head slowly.
"No."
For the first time Second Bird hears emotion in his voice---regret,
perhaps,
or something close to it.
"Sooner or later, your kind will always rebel.
I must consider a different approach."
He turns and walks into the desert without another word.

*Many years later,
Second Bird takes his grandchildren to the towers.
He tells them the story of the god-king
and shows them how to predict the changing seasons by the way certain stars line up with the towers.
As he falls asleep for the last time,
he wonders if the god-king ever found someone to build what he needed.*

**Gyeongju / Actual minus 2300 years**

"It was Her Majesty's first decree as princess,"
the young astrologer said,
immediately hating himself for telling such a distinguished scholar
something he undoubtedly already knew.

But the visitor from the Middle Kingdom smiled politely as he studied the star-gazing tower.
It was the height of five men,
and to the enlightened eye,
the number and placement of its stones represented historical and astronomical figures.
"I understand her decision was... not universally popular," he said.

The young astrologer inclined his head,
conscious of their escorts standing a few feet away.
"Not universally popular" didn't quite capture the way the conservative aristocracy had felt
about a woman ascending to the throne,
particularly when the Taizong Emperor refused to acknowledge her,
but it was neither polite nor prudent to dwell upon that.

"And this must be the foreign barbarian I have heard so much about,"
the visitor continued
as a tall figure in the plain brown robe of a monk
came up the gravel path in the waning evening light.

The young astrologer inclined his head again.
He was no longer taken aback by the foreigner's dark skin,
but would never get used to how quietly he walked.
"Are you at peace?" he asked in greeting.

"I am, and you?"
He had forgotten to wear sandals again,
the young astrologer noted,
but according to the caretaker he had at least eaten that day.
Her Majesty's minister insisted on regular reports,
and the young astrologer would much rather fill them with trivia like that
than even hint at some of the things the foreigner said.

He cleared his throat.
"May I have the honor of introducing you to scholar Liu Zhao,
who has come from the court of the Gaozong Emperor?
I apologize for any appearance of poor manners,"
he continued,
turning to the visitor,
"But my colleague has no name by which to be introduced."

Scholar Liu raised a perfectly groomed eyebrow.
"Not even a temple name?"

"I am not a monk,"
the foreigner said.
"I have simply misplaced it."
He brushed a finger over the scar that wrinkled the left side of his head.

The scholar smiled.
"And to think there are those who spend their lifetimes trying to let go of such things."
He gestured at the tower.
"It is quite marvelous."

The foreigner nodded.
"It has been very useful."

"Mm."
Scholar Liu jerked his chin at the scrolls
whose ends stuck out of his satchel.
"I have heard much about the records you have made.
I am told they are extremely precise."

The foreigner gave a small shrug.
"As precise as they can be.
Improving them will be the work of many lifetimes."

The young astrologer's heart skipped a beat.
The foreigner had the keenest eyes and most prodigious memory of anyone the younger astrologer had ever met---of
anyone he'd ever heard of---but even for a follower of the Quiet Sage,
his views were sometimes...unorthodox.

He opened his mouth to say something diverting,
but was interrupted by a shout as a guard came running up the path.
"Her Majesty..." he panted,
speaking to the two escorts rather than to the scholars.
"Her Majesty is gone. She is gone."

The soft buzz of dusk insects was the only sound in the shocked silence that followed.
"Stay here,"
the older escort ordered the three scholars.
He hurried away with his partner and the messenger in tow.

Scholar Liu turned to the foreigner.
"Come with me,"
he said without preamble.
"Come with me to the court of the Gaozong Emperor.
You will have a dozen towers like this one,
and a dozen scribes to record your findings."

The young astrologer's jaw dropped.
Were all the courtiers of the Middle Kingdom so callous?

The foreigner studied Scholar Liu for a moment,
then shook his head.
"You honor me," he said,
"And perhaps some day I will make that journey.
But tonight,
my colleague and I have work to do."

The hungry expression on Scholar Liu's face melted,
leaving anger in its wake.
"As you choose," he said coldly.
"If you will excuse me?"
He strode away,
the gravel scraping under his sandals.

The young astrologer turned to the foreigner.
"Being invited to the emperor's court is quite an honor,"
he ventured cautiously.
"And there are many fine scholars there with whom you could converse."

The foreigner nodded.
"I'm sure there are.
But I find no deficiency of any kind in those I know here."
And for the first time since the young astrologer had met him,
he smiled.

**Maragheh / Actual minus 1700 years**

"But you could take the books."
Batu had led his *arban* back and forth across half of Asia.
They had fought against Uzbeks,
Pathans,
Persians,
Pathans again,
bandits,
Turks,
and even a company of Frankish mercenaries
who had somehow found themselves east of the Black Sea.
They had heard him bellow orders,
scream as they gallopped into battle,
and even sing in a surprisingly melodious voice,
but they had never heard him raise his voice the way he just had.

Otgon cleared his throat and hefted the golden candlestick he held
as if unsure whether he should drop it,
hand it to his commander,
or hide it behind his back.
"Yes sir.
There are some tapestries too, and a samovar.
He said we could have those too,
just as long as we left the books alone."

"How kind," Batu said.
"Tell me---does he *look* mad?"

"No sir. He looks Ethiopian."

"Who does?"
Batu glanced over his shoulder at the question,
then dropped to one knee,
eyes downcast.

"My *beg*,"
he said.

"Get up, get up."
Mirza Muhammad Taraghay bin Shahrukh wore the same quilted jacket as his men,
though his was fine silk instead of homespun linen.
His personal guard stood behind him,
blades bared and eyes constantly moving.
Maragheh hadn't put up much of a fight,
but the *beg* had many enemies.
"What's this about an Ethiopian?"

Batu got to his feet,
careful not to wince at the protest from his knee.
"Up the hill, my *beg*,"
he said.
"Some crazy man saying we can have the gold if we leave the books."
He snapped his fingers at Otgon,
who held up the golden candlestick for inspection.

The *beg* narrowed his eyes.
"Interesting.
Come, let us see what he has to say."

Batu and his *arban* followed the *beg* and his guards up the hill.
"Tuck it under your coat,"
Batu muttered before Otgon could ask.
"If you're lucky, he'll forget you have it."
Not that there was much chance of that, he reflected.
The man people were already calling the Ulugh Beg---the Great Ruler---was
as famous for his intelligence as he was for being the grandson of the Great Timur.
Still,
a man could hope...

The observatory had been a marvel in its heyday,
but time, neglect, and decades of minor earthquakes
had brought one wall wall down completely
and left others leaning perilously.
The *beg* picked his way across the cracked and tilted courtyard tiles
to the one door that still hung true in its frame.
To Batu's surprise he paused at its threshold and knocked.
"Peace be upon you," he called.
"May we enter?"



A zij is an Islamic astronomical book that tabulates parameters used for astronomical calculations of the positions of the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets.
Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Tusi (1201-74) was a Persian polymath who created very accurate tables of planetary motion,
and is often credited with establishing trigonometry as a discipline in its own right (and possibly a precursor to Copernicus via uncredited work).
Hulagu Khan created an observatory for Tusi at Maragheh in the 13th century.
The facility became inactive in the 14th century after losing patronage, and was ruined by a series of earthquakes.
The contents of its library were stolen during the Mongol invasion, but the remains inspired Ulugh Beg to construct an observatory in Samarkand in 1428.

**Uraniborg / Actual minus 1400 years**

Uraniborg was built between 1576 and 1580 on the island of Hven by Tycho Brahe, then expanded to Stjerneborg after it turned out that tower-mounted instruments swayed too much in the wind. Brahe abandoned the site in 1597 after he fell out of favor with the Danish king Christian IV; it was destroyed in 1601. It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe.

A "Jantar Mantar" is a giant sundial with a triangular gnomon whose hypotenuse is parallel to the Earth's axis. On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle parallel to the plane of the equator. The instrument can measure the time of day to an accuracy of half a second. "Yantra mantar" means "calculation instrument". There were five, but the one in Mathura was torn down just before the Revolt of 1875 (possibly just neglect and scavenging).

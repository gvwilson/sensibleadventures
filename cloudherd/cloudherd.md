## Chapter 1

*Consider Cherne.
A diamond adrift in the heavens,
it measures eight thousand gallops from north to south
and six thousand from east to west.
Its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean
whose outer shore, the Worldrim, is an unbroken range of mountains
whose peaks tower above even the highest-flying cloud.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilots,
and nearly ended with them as well.
Powerful and inhuman,
they destroyed themselves in a war
that scarred the moon and turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass.
When the last battle was over the Pilots were gone,
leaving the world to carry on as best it could.*

*Now look there,
in the north,
where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms.
It is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot, 1272 Years Since,
and a girl who is no longer a child but not quite yet a woman
is standing on a cloud,
chilled to the bone and desperately hoping that
the old man beside her knows what he's doing...*

"Hold on!" Grappa Gas bellowed.
"It's going to get bumpy!"

Noxy dropped to one knee,
pulling the glove off her left hand
and pressing her palm into Big Blue's spongy gray back.
She could mind-hear how tired the cloud was.
He was even older than Grappa Gas,
and had just flown hard into a headwind for an hour.

*Faster!* she urged.
*Please, faster!*
She shivered despite her camelskin hat and coat,
her bare hand already numbed by the icy mountain air.

Behind her,
the tiger Kulbinder snarled at the crows that had attacked them.
One broke off from the swirling flock and dove at his head.
He swiped at it with one paw,
cursing in Thindi as the black bird snapped its wings open
so that the wind threw it sideways
just an instant before the tiger's claws would have torn it apart.

Up ahead,
a barren stump of rock rose like an island out of the forest.
Half a dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire on top of it.
Shading her eyes with her free hand,
Noxy saw the soldiers they were supposed to rescue.
Their kilts and sturdy boots were travel-stained,
and their battle masks and lacquered leather armor were scarred from fighting.
Some had swords in their hands,
while others held spears or bows.
Big Blue's mate Pillow was directly above them,
her sides rippling as she struggled to keep station in the wind,
but the soldiers kept their eyes on the trees,
waiting for the forest to attack again.

"You're coming in too low!" Granna Fee yelled.
Noxy's grandmother lay full length on Big Blue,
propped up on her elbows with her precious binoculars in her hands.
"Level off!"

"There's no time!" Grappa Gas yelled back,
his red-and-yellow scarf flapping madly behind him.
"We're going to have to bump and scrape!"
The old man closed his eyes.
His lips moved as he mind-spoke commands to the cloud beneath him.
Noxy mind-heard Big Blue protest,
but even as the old bull grumbled he bunched up
and went into a long, steep dive.

Noxy had just a moment to think,
*I'd be grounded for a __month__ if I even __thought__ about doing something like this,*
and then the cloud thudded against the side of the peak like a sack full of wet wool.
Noxy yelped and sprawled forward,
landing in an untidy heap on Granna Fee's legs.
"Sorry!" she said,
but her grandmother was already up,
swaying to keep her balance as the cloud scraped across the rock,
flattened two tents,
and came to a halt.

The tiger bounded off with a roar.
"What are you waiting for!?" Granna Fee shouted at the soldiers,
sliding down Big Blue's flank and waving her arm as if to sweep them all onto the cloud.
"Get on! Get on!"

Grappa Gas caught Noxy's arm as she scrambled back onto her feet.
"I'll help 'em up. You stay here and keep Blue together."
Without waiting for her to answer he stumped forward,
his peg leg leaving dimples in the cloud.
"And keep an eye out for squirrels!"
he yelled over his shoulder.

Noxy glanced at the forest.
Something big and brown swing between two trees.
Another hairy shape followed it,
then another.
Suddenly the trees were full of them,
hooting and shaking the branches.

"Grappa! Grappa! trolls!" she shouted.

"I see 'em!" the old man shouted back.

"And a bear!" Noxy added
as a brown bear charged out of the trees and reared up on its hind legs
to bellow a challenge.

"Of *course* there's a bear,"
Grappa Gas grunted as he clasped hands with the nearest soldier
and helped him scramble up onto the cloud.
A second soldier tossed his spear aside and pulled himself up beside the first.
Together they reached back and hauled up a third man
while Grappa Gas reached for a fourth.

But instead of grabbing the cloudherd's hand,
the man on the ground lifted a heavy canvas-wrapped bundle.
"Never mind that, get yourself up here!" Grappa Gas ordered.

"We're not leaving them!" the man on the ground yelled back.
One of the soldiers already on the cloud shouldered Grappa Gas aside,
grabbed a handful the canvas,
and tried to drag it onto the cloud.
His legs sank halfway to his knees with the weight.

Noxy felt Big Blue shudder beneath them.
She dropped to her knees and pressed her hand against the cloud once again.
*He didn't mean to,* she mind-said,
trying to squelch her fear so that he couldn't mind-hear it.
*Please, stay bunched up just a little longer.*
She pictured the cloud pulling itself into a dense blob.
Reluctantly,
the cloud began to contract.

Noxy heard a shrill whistle from her friends keeping watch on board Pillow.
The trolls stopped hooting.
Cold fear jellied in her gut.
"Grappa---" she started to say.

"Just keep him together!" Grappa Gas snapped.
Cursing, he yanked another soldier up onto the cloud.
This one was no older than she was,
Noxy realized,
his face marked by four parallel scars that looked like they had only just healed.
He took two steps before his feet slipped out from under him.
He fell awkwardly beside the half-dozen canvas-wrapped bundles
that now lay side by side on Big Blue's back.

The tiger scrambled up the cloud behind the boy.
Noxy mind-heard Big Blue's protest as the great cat's claws dug into his flank.
*Just a little longer,* she begged.
*Please, just a little longer.*

She glanced at the forest.
A brown mass swirled back and forth around the bases of the trees like blown leaves.
Above it, the trolls began hooting again
as the will of the forest surged through their minds like a raging flood.

"Spread yourselves out, you numbskulls!"
Grappa Gas thundered at the soldiers struggling not to sink into the cloud.
"Lie down if you have to!
Come on, Fee, we gotta fly!"

Noxy's grandmother clambered up Big Blue's flank
with a speed born from decades of practice.
"Now or never!" she yelled at the last soldier.
He grabbed a handful of cloud
just as a swarm of squirrels burst out of the forest and surged up the rocky slope,
thousands of them leaping from stone to stone,
their bright, mad eyes fixed on the intruders.

*Up!* Noxy mind-yelled at Big Blue.
The cloud heaved himself into the air.

The last soldier hung on desperately
as the cloud's flank squished between his fingers like soggy dough.
A dozen squirrels jumped at his legs.
One managed to catch hold of his boot,
scrambling up the laces and sinking its teeth into his calf.
The soldier cursed and kicked it off.

The young soldier with the scarred face
flung himself across the cloud and grabbed his comrade's hand.
Without thinking,
Noxy threw herself onto the soldier's legs
to stop him from being dragged off by his comrade's weight.
Grunting and cursing,
they somehow managed to get the last soldier up onto Big Blue's back.

"You idiot!" Grappa Gas yelled as the soldier rolled over onto his back,
gasping.
"You saints-be-damned *idiot*!
They would have peeled you like an apple!
What was so damned important that you couldn't just leave it?"
He kicked one of the bundles.
"Eh? What was so---urp!"

In one smooth motion the soldier had rolled onto his feet
and grabbed a handful of Grappa Gas's collar.
"With respect, honored, I'm grateful for the rescue,"
he panted.
"But that's one of my men you're kicking,
and I'll be thanking you to stop."

He let go of Grappa Gas's coat.
The cloudherd coughed.
"Ah.
Sorry, lad.
I didn't realize."
He looked down at the bodies lying at his feet.
"I'm sorry."

The soldier nodded.
"Me too."
He stared back at the stump of rock,
where the squirrels had already torn the tents to pieces.
"Me too."

*Earlier that day...*

Noxy and Sensy volunteered to collect spiderwebs that morning---or rather,
Noxy volunteered them both and Sensy went along with it like always.
Winter had finally turned to spring:
stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the shadows of the twisted mountain pines,
but the sun shone diamond-bright in a clear blue sky,
and being indoors suddenly seemed unbearable.
Besides,
getting out of the village would give them a chance for a talk
that Noxy thought was long overdue.

"Shoo."
She poked a fat brown spider with a stick.
It waved its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a new home.
Noxy cut its web's anchor threads with two practiced twists of her knife
and started winding it onto a stick.

"Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?" Sensy asked.

Noxy glanced at her.
"Why? Are those ones coming loose?"
She had been trying for an hour to think of a way to broach the subject of their mutual friend Rash,
who was the only boy their age in the village.

"No, they're just kind of plain."
Sensy looked down at her bulky camelskin coat critically.
"Granna Fee has some really nice red ones.
She said she'd give them to me if I picked the stones out of her pepper garden."

"Her whole garden? That would take forever."
Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web
and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder.
"Why would you do all that work for buttons you don't need?"

"Oh, you're no help," Sensy pouted.
She had spent the winter embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar.
All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes and her hair
and who she and Noxy might meet that summer.
The only thing she *didn't* want to talk about was Rash.

"A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes,"
Granna Fee had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger
who seemed to have taken her best friend's place.

"Not me!" Noxy had declared.

Her grandmother had laughed.
"No, sweetling, not you."

She and Sensy and Rash had grown up together,
done chores together,
played tag and make-believe in the forest around Stale together,
and learned to mind-speak with clouds together,
but something had changed that winter.
Sometimes Noxy saw Sensy look at Rash,
or Rash look at Sensy,
and then look away as if they felt guilty.
And when they talked to each other,
all they did was bicker.
If her two best friends were mad at one another,
Noxy thought,
it was her job go sort it out.

Noxy slung her bag over her shoulder.
"Come on, there's more up on the ridge."
She set off without waiting for an answer.
A moment later Sensy scrambled to catch up with her.

The path was one of dozens that snaked through the evergreen forest surrounding Stale.
Mud made it slippery where it wasn't slick with ice,
but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the rocky ridge overlooking her home.

Below them lay the ancient walls of the fortress that held the village of Stale.
The centuries had smoothed the edges of the Pilots' stonework,
making the fortress look like it was made of snow that was just starting to helt,
but it was still as solid as the mountains themselves.
The villagers' two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the walls like ducklings in a nest,
thin licks of smoke rising from their slate chimneys.
Narrow streets wound between camel pens, vegetable plots, and racks laden with drying spiderwebs,
and even from a distance Noxy could hear
the soft musical clang of the windchimes that hung by every door.

To the west the fortress wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.
A net woven from spider thread stretched over its top,
as light as a dream but as strong as steel.
Another net hung down at the gorge's mouth to make a gate.
Inside,
just visible from the ridge,
two gray clouds floated half-asleep.

Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds,
riding them,
and most importantly,
practicing mind-speech with them.
Grownups called Big Blue and Pillow slow and lazy,
but they and the herd of half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance
were the most exciting things in Noxy's world.

As Noxy pulled her bag off her shoulder,
Sensy grabbed her arm.
"Look!"  she hissed,
pointing into the trees.

At first all Noxy saw was branches,
but then a pair of dark eyes blinked.
Black fur framed a round face with heavy brows and a gray muzzle.
The troll blinked again and pulled a branch aside with one long, hairy arm.

Noxy and Sensy took a step back, then another,
and froze at a sudden rustling behind them.
Noxy turned her head slowly to look over her shoulder.
A second troll hung by one hand from a branch behind them,
blocking their way.

"Wh-what are they doing here?" Sensy whispered loudly.

"Ssh!" Noxy said.  "Just... don't... move."

Branches rustled overhead.
Two---three---four trolls swung by,
except no,
the fourth didn't by by.
It stopped and looked down at them.
Its fur was shot through with gray,
and even from five strides below it Noxy could see the long hairless scar that ran up the length of its left leg.

Something twinged in the back of her head like the start of one of her headaches.
For a moment it was as if *she* was in the tree looking down at herself.

A roar broke the stillness.
The gray troll hooted and vanished into the forest.
Noxy and Sensy let out long shaky breaths---

---and shrieked as a tiger burst out of the trees half a dozen strides in front of them.
His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes,
not orange and black like the picture in the book
that three generations of village children had passed around.
A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear,
and his tail twitched slightly as he looked at them,
as if their presence reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.

"Are you all right?" he rumbled.

"Wh-what?" Noxy stammered.

"Are... you... all... right?" the tiger repeated impatiently.
"Did those blasted chimpanzees harm you at all?"

"No, they---I mean, we're all right.
We're fine, thank you very much.
Ouch, Sensy, you're going to break my fingers!"
Noxy pulled her hand free from her friend's terrified grip.

"Pilots be praised,"
the tiger rumbled,
settling onto his haunches.
"Now, if I may ask a favor,
could you be so kind as to direct me to the village of Stale Leftovers?"
His ear twitched at the sound of a distant hoot.
"Or if perchance you are going that way yourselves,
may I have the honor of accompanying you?
Those creatures will think twice about molesting you
if you have a protector."

Sensy hitched her bag up on her shoulder.
"They didn't molest us," she protested.
We---I mean, the village,
we have an arrangement with them.
The trolls.
We don't go too far into the forest,
and they don't come near the village except for when they want to trade,
and they leave some stones down by the fish pond, and---"

Noxy cut her off with a gesture.
"I'm sorry.
Who are you?"

"I am Kulbinder of Thind," the tiger said, rising to all fours.
"And if you will forgive my impatience,
my need is rather pressing.
My companions are in grave danger and need help."

Noxy shot a look at Sensy.
Her friend shook her head and mouthed "no".
That was enough to make up Noxy's mind.

"It's this way," she said, pointing down the path.
"Come on!"

Ten minutes later they reached the fortress gate.
An enormous slab of stone had once hung there like a door
on hinges made of polished diamond.
The diamonds were long gone,
but a few pieces of the shattered slab still lay half-buried in the ground,
too heavy for mountain camels to pull free.

Grappa Gas was sitting on one of them
whittling a new leg when they came out of the trees.
He raised a hand in greeting,
then swore and clambered to his feet at the sight of the tiger.
"Saints and their inventions!"
He pointed accusingly with his whittling knife.
"What in the underhells is this?"

"*This* is a who, not a what," Kulbinder replied curtly.

"We met him up by the spider grove," Noxy said hurriedly.
"There were some trolls, and he scared them off."

"Trolls?"
Grappa Gas said skeptically.
"What would trolls be doing there?
They haven't come down this far in---"

"Grappa!"
Noxy stomped her foot.
"Never mind that now!
The tiger says people need our help.
At least, I think they're people,"
she added belatedly.

"They are that," the tiger confirmed.
"Can you take me to your *tralpa*?"

Grappa Gas snorted.
"Not hardly.
But the reeve's about.
Follow me."

A few minutes and a lot of questions later,
the whole village was in the cobbled square---or rather,
the whole village minus most of the adults,
who had left a week ago for the snowfields to collect Stale's clouds from their winter pasture.
Three hundred people,
from babies to grandparents,
stood in a half-circle around the impatient tiger.
Some still wore the thick coats and pants they used in winter and when cloudherding.
Others,
like Noxy and Sensy,
had switched to lighter clothes
that would still have seemed heavy to anyone unfamiliar with the icy winds of the high mountains.
Grappa Gas's son Aft,
who had been splitting logs to make shingles,
was the only one in shirtsleeves,
but not the only one scowling at the new arrival.

Noxy's mother Indy thumped the speaker's drum three times
and stepped up onto the squared-off stone that marked the center of the square.
"Friends," she said loudly,
patting the air with her hands to quiet everyone.
"Friends, please.
I know it is early in the year for travelers,
but please, give welcome to Kulbinder, a Gifted of Thind."

"Welcome... welcome... be welcome..."
Some voices were hearty,
some grudging,
and some people didn't speak at all,
but Noxy's mother took it all in stride like she always did.

Someone nudged Noxy's shoulder with their own.
"Hey," Rash said, slipping between her and Sensy.
"Where's the *tralpa*?
Is he too afraid of the tiger to come out and say hello?
Or has he been up all night studying again?"
He mimed someone drinking from a bottle.

"Ssh!"
But he was right---the voice and hand of the king in Stale Remainders,
who was also the least useful magician Noxy had ever met,
was nowhere to be seen.

Indy thumped the brightly-painted speaker's drum again.
"The Gifted has told me that he and his companions were trying to get through the pass to Chaghan.
An avalanche forced them off the road."
She swept her gaze across the assembled villagers.
"They made camp in the trees.
The forest became angry.
Some have died, and the rest are trapped.
They need our help."

A murmur ran through the crowd.
The Herd of Trees that blanketed the Brumoso Mountains
guarded its territory as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs.
People who stayed near the Pilots' ancient roads never came to harm,
and those who ventured deeper were safe in small numbers.
If they made a fire,
though,
or cut a branch from one of the towering redwoods
that Granna Fee cautioned Noxy and her friends to steer clear of on training flights,
the forest's wrath could be as merciless as a winter storm.

Aft elbowed his way to the front of the small crowd.
"These companion you're talking about---are they smugglers?"
he asked loudly without waiting for Indy to call on him.

Noxy's mother suppressed an exasperated sigh.
"Not that the Gifted has said, no."

"Then why in the saints' names were they trying to get through the pass this time of year?
It'll be another month at least before the high trails clear."
He crossed his muscular arms.
"Isn't something folk would do."

"My companions are not 'folk',"
the tiger said haughtily.
"They are soldiers."

The crowd murmured again.
"Soldiers?" Aft said disbelievingly.
"What are soldiers doing up here?"

The soldier blinked slowly.
"Deserting."

"Well ain't that a bucket of trouble,"
Aft said sarcastically as yet another murmur ran through the crowd.
"Are you hoping we're going to help you hide out?"

The tiger's tail twitched.
"I did not come to your village to hide,
honored.
In truth,
I did not intend to come here at all,
but my companions need help.
You are their only hope---if you fear it will bring more trouble than you can chew,
say so and I will be on my way."

"Nobody is saying we won't help," Indy said firmly.
"And as long as I'm reeve, nobody is *going* to say that."
She raised a hand to cut Aft off before he could speak again.
"We can argue about the politics later.
Right now there's folk in trouble,
and I won't have it said that we ever turned our backs on those that needed us."

The next five minutes were chaos.
Out of the question, Aft said emphatically.
The *tralpa* might look the other way
if they sheltered a stray who'd been stupid enough to anger the forest,
but flying off to rescue a rebel army?
Even he would have to report that.
"We have to look to our own,"
he finished,
glancing meaningfully at the bulge under his wife Rind's coat.

And what did he think "their own" were going say
when they got back from rounding up the village's clouds
and found out that the folk who'd stayed behind
had left strangers at the forest's mercy,
Grappa Gas shot back.
Father and son glared at each other
with a mutual stubbornness born of long practice.

The argument swirled back and forth across the cobblestones,
punctuated by soft bings and bongs from the village windchimes.
Little whirlpools of disagreement came together,
spun about,
and flew apart as people overheard neighbors they disagreed with,
or turned around to nod ad something they had overheard
and were sucked into yet another "what if?"

"This is going to go on forever," Noxy said sourly.
"They're all going to do whatever my *amma* wants to do in the end.
Why don't they just get on with it?"
She, Sensy, and Rash stayed together in a knot on the sidelines,
old enough that they hadn't grown bored and run off to play like the younger children,
but young enough that the discussion seemed vaguely ridiculous.

Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a mustache.
It had become a habit over the winter,
one that Noxy had told him countless times he ought to break
before *someone* broke his stupid finger.
"What I want to know is whether we're going to get to go,
or if we're going to be stuck here with the littles."

"Of course we'll get to go," Noxy said dismissively.

"You sure about that?"
Rash raised an eyebrow,
another annoying habit he had cultivated over the winter.
"Because your *amma*'s giving jobs to just about everyone except us."

Noxy puffed an annoyed breath,
biting off her, "Of course I'm sure!" when at Sensy's uncertain look.
"Wait here," she ordered.

She strode through the crowd to the speaker's stone
and caught her mother's eye.
Before Noxy could speak,
Indy said,
"Oh, and I think you've met my daughter, Probably Noxious."

"The honor was mine," the tiger rumbled,
flicking an ear in what might have been the feline equivalent of a very small bow.

"Just call me Noxy," she told him.
"*Amma*, which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on?
We can go and start getting them ready while everyone's still jawing."

Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well.
"Who said anything about you three going?"

But Noxy knew her mother as well as her mother knew her,
and had assembled her arguments as she crossed the square.
They were definitely old enough---why,
they were all going to be riding *real* clouds in a few weeks,
not just the tame old pair floating in the cloud pen.
And they wouldn't be going far,
just a few gallops down the pass,
and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do rescues,
wasn't it?
And---

"Stop."
Her mother held up a hand,
pointedly ignoring the amused look on Granna Fee's face.
"You can go.  But!" she continued,
"You do what you're told and nothing more, understood?"

Noxy nodded obediently.
"Yes, *amma*."
She had learned long ago not to keep asking for a whole orange
when she'd already talked her mother into a half.

Eventually everyone realized that they agreed with Indy's decision
or were so outnumbered as to make further argument pointless.
Even Aft gave in
on condition that he be given lead on one of the clouds
so that he could keep an eye on things.

After that,
it only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed.
Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains,
and they had lifted more than one tinker or trader out of a difficult spot.
Coils of hemp rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen,
and everyone kept a camelskin cap and some heavy gloves handy just in case.

"You look ridiculous," Noxy told Rash flatly
as he came down the wooden steps to the mounting platform.
He had embroidered a pattern he claimed was eagle's wings
onto the flaps of his cap during the winter,
and was wearing bright orange gloves
that the last of the autumn pack traders had sworn were all the rage in Gandan.

Rash looked her up and down.
"Really?  Because I think you look amazing. Excuse me."
He winked and stepped around the speechless fourteen-year-old.

They were the last to arrive at the wooden platform
that hung over the edge of the cloud pen.
"Ears all!" Aft said loudly.
He had changed into heavy pants,
a padded coat,
and a pair of soft boots,
and his hair was tied back in a thick club braid
with a blue ribbon from his wedding collar for luck.
"I'll lead on Pillow with Rash and Sensy as spotters.
Gas and Fee, you're on Blue---you take Noxy and the Gifted with you.
In and out,
quick and simple,
and everyone's back here for soup before you can sneeze.
No adventures, right?"
He glared at Noxy, Sensy, and Rash until the three teenagers mumbled,
"No adventures."

"Right!"
He walked to the end of the plank that stuck out from the platform
and whistled through his fingers.
When nothing happened,
he muttered something about "soggy" and "lazy" and whistled again more loudly.

A hundred strides away and fifty strides below them,
a fog-edged blue-gray mass began to pull itself into
something dense enough to hold a person's weight.
The second,
smaller blob next to it followed suit.
Side by side,
Big Blue and Pillow drifted toward the platform.
A clattering noise further along the ravine signalled that
whoever Indy had sent to pull back the pen's spiderweb gate
had started hauling in the rope-and-bamboo chain it hung from.

Noxy's pulse beat faster as the clouds approached,
their flanks rippling slightly in the wind.
When Big Blue bumped against the ravine wall,
Aft took three steps and jumped off the end of the plank.

Noxy leaned over the railing.
One, two, three...
Big Blue dimpled as the burly cloudherd tucked,
flipped over,
spread-eagled,
and landed flat on his back.
Gray waves rippled out across the cloud's back
as he rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly.
Noxy couldn't see his face,
but she knew his eyes would be closed in concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount.

"Show-off," Grappa Gas muttered.

Granna Fee elbowed him.
"Gets it from his old man."

Something twinged in the back of Noxy's head.
She blinked.
"Did you say something?" she asked Sensy.

"What?"
She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.

Noxy shook her head.
"Never mind.
Look, he's coming up."

Big Blue rose toward the platform,
bunching into an even firmer mass as he neared them.
Aft had risen to one knee,
but kept one hand on the cloud's back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.

A silver-winged scaw shot out of its cliffside nest,
cawing its displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away.
Aft looked up and smiled as he always did
when he was on cloudback or holding hands with his wife.
With a whoop he ran across across Big Blue's back
and launched himself into the air again.

Rash whistled.
"Nice leap," he said appreciatively
as Aft landed dead center on Pillow.
"And into the blind, too."

"It's not such a trick," Noxy said dismissively,
though she was secretly impressed.
"He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she was."

"Sure, but would you trust a cloud's eyes that much?"
Rash challenged her.
"Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out of what they say."

Noxy shrugged.
She had realized early in their training that
mind-speech was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash,
or even for some of the olders who were already riding.
She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing off.
The only person she shared her progress with now was her grandmother,
and even then she didn't tell Granna Fee everything.

Grappa Gas made everyone wait
until Pillow was only a couple of strides below the mounting platform
before he let Sensy and Rash jump.
The teenagers had been doing it since they were children,
but the brief moment of flight and *poof!* as they landed
still made them whoop.

Aft steered the cow out of the way
so that Big Blue could take her place beneath the plank.
Grappa Gas landed on him with a soft *thud*.
Granna Fee tossed down two bundles of blankets.
"Your turn," she said to Kulbinder.

The tiger's ears lay flat against his skull.
His tail whipped from side to side.
For a moment Noxy thought he was going to refuse,
but with a sudden burst of speed he charged to the end of the plank and jumped.
She and Granna Fee leaned over the railing.

"Huh," Granna Fee said.
"I guess they really do always land on their feet."

*Twinge.*
Noxy winced and put her hand on the back of her head.
There it was again, that feeling of---of *something*, but what?

Her grandmother noticed her expression.
"Are you all right?"

"Sure," Noxy lied.
One of the grownups' many rules was that no one should fly if they were sick,
and she was not about to be left behind.
"Come on, let's see if you remember your lessons."

"Cheeky," her grandmother said.
Three quick steps and a little hop and she was gone,
leaving Noxy alone on the platform.
She took a deep breath,
grinned,
and sprinted for the end of the plank.

She landed just a stride away from her grandmother,
who was lying flat on her back on the cloud.
"Oof," Granna Fee grunted,
rolling over and sitting up.
"He's not as soft as he used to be."
Then she smiled and put her arm around Noxy
so that her granddaughter could lean against her
as she pressed her hand against Big Blue and closed her eyes.
The cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the mouth of the gorge.

"I'll take lead," Aft called back through cupped hands.

"Really? How unusual of you,"
Granna Fee said just loudly enough to make Noxy grin.
She steered Big Blue into position behind the smaller cow.

As they neared the gate,
Aft took the ox horn from his belt and blew three loud notes.
Indy blew an answering note
as the two clouds passed through the gate and into the pass.

Cloudherding is cold work, even in the summer.
In the spring,
when every breath instantly turns to fog
and the wind pokes its fingers through every loose seam and down every collar,
it's freezing.
As they left the cloud pen behind,
Granna Fee took a camel hair blanket from the nearest bundle
and wrapped it around herself and Noxy,
leaving only their faces exposed.
Up ahead,
Noxy saw that Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy had said more than once,
he might be a goof,
but at least he was a *warm* goof.

Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected.
"Saints and their inventions,
but I love this," he sighed.
He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden leg on
so that it wouldn't poke into Big Blue,
but a long scarf only slightly less colorful than Rash's gloves
was his only concession to the freezing temperature.
"Look, the condors are back in their nest!
We should invite them them to visit some time."

"They're not really the most sociable creatures,"
Granna Fee said dryly.

Grappa Gas harrumphed.
"You just have to get to know them.
I wonder if any of their chicks will be Gifted this year?
That would be a thing, wouldn't it?"

It had taken the tiger a day to make his way up the pass to Stale Leftovers.
Even with the headwind,
the clouds covered the same distance in half an hour.
"There," Granna Fee said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.

Grappa Gas frowned, then looked at Kulbinder.
"I thought you said there were just a few of them."

"Fewer than we started with," the tiger growled.
He had spent the flight crouched down to get out of the wind,
his legs and tail tucked underneath his body.
Now he stood and padded forward to join Granna Fee at Big Blue's leading edge.

The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock
that rose out of the forest like an island.
A dozen drab tents huddled around a small fire.
Shading her eyes with her hand,
Noxy saw a dozen men moving about,
some leaning against one another to stay upright.

Grappa Gas gave a low whistle.
"The *tralpa* really isn't going to like this,"
he said.

"Never mind him," Granna Fee replied.
"What do you think my daughter is going to say?"

One of the soldiers spotted them a moment later.
They were too far away to hear his shout,
but there was no mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms
or in the way his companions hurried to roust their injured comrades.

"Keep your eyes wide," Grappa Gas ordered Noxy curtly.
"Forest might be happy to let us take them, or it might not."

It wasn't.
An angry voice cawed behind them.
A hundred more answered it.
All at once they were surrounded by a flock of gray crows,
each one an angry feathered missile with sharp claws and a pecking beak.

Noxy screamed as a crow grabbed her hair.
Another took hold of her collar and pecked her shoulder.
She screamed again,
swatting at them as Granna Fee and Grappa Gas yelled and did the same.

The tiger's roar sent the birds wheeling back into the air.
Noxy slapped at her hair one last time,
then spun around at a faint shout from up ahead
as the flock descended on the other three cloudherds.

"Get off! Get off me!" Aft shouted,
spinning the end of a coil of rope over his head to keep them at bay
while Sensy and Rash batted at any bird that came too close.
The crows swirled around them for a dozen heartbeats before veering away again.

Aft handed the rope to Rash and knelt to press his hands against Pillow.
A moment later he looked up and shook his head grimly.
"She's terrified," he bellowed through cupped hands.
"Won't go any closer.  We have to leave them!"

"Underhells with that," Grappa Gas muttered.
"Fee---I'll get Blue down there.
You 'n' Noxy get 'em loaded up fast as you can."

"But---" Granna Fee protested.

"Hold on!" Grappa Gas bellowed as they went into a dive.
"It's going to get bumpy!"

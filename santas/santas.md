## Episode 1: 

Once up on a time,
in a world halfway between yours and mine,
lived a young santa named Finner.
They came from a long line of santas and elves:
their mother made her first wind-up singing wombat
when she was not much bigger than a wombat herself,
while their father had started helping with deliveries
as soon as he was reliably out of diapers.<sup>
There's a story behind the word "reliably" in that sentence,
but it's best told some other time.
</sup>

Now,
Finner enjoyed elfing:
the smell of solder,
the *shick shick* of freshly-sharpened scissors,
and the pride they felt when the two halves of a dovetail joint fit perfectly together.
But sitting in a workshop made them restless.
Their mother suggested running up and down three flights of stairs over and over
to burn off the energy:
it only made them sweaty.
They tried sitting cross-legged on the floor with their eyes closed
while they hummed softly to themselves like the monks of Lotse Nuffin:<sup>
The monks were their father's favorite clients.
They wanted nothing,
so every year that's exactly what he took them,
and they were always grateful.
</sup>
all they got was a cold bum.

They tried helping with deliveries too,
and they enjoyed it just as much.
After all,
who *wouldn't* enjoy slithering down sooty chimneys
scaling the icy concrete sides of apartment buildings,
or trying to land a sleigh on a yurt without leaving a single dent in its stiff felt roof?
"Me," said the small voice in Finner's head.
"Or rather, I do, but it's not enough."

They tried to talk to their friends about it
without actually explaining the problem.
That... didn't go well.
Finner's parents were the only elf and santa in town.
There were others nearby---aunts and uncles
and second cousins twice removed
and even a few who'd married into the trade
and done quite well for themselves
despite what Finner's great-grandmother never actually said out loud at family gatherings<sup>
She was a hundred and twenty two years old,
and could not say things so loudly that no one else could hear themselves think.</sup>---but
none of children Finner went to school with or played Hide and Stay Hidden with
could ever really understand how much hard work went into making that one day special every year.

That thought made them wonder if they were lazy,
which was a synonym for "sinful" where they lived,
so they tried a few experiments.
Working twice as hard made them even sweatier than running up and down stairs.
Working half as hard made their father ask if they were sick and their mother mutter about teenagers.
Neither made the yearning in their chest go away.
It grew and grew until finally,
desperately,
they realized there was only one thing left for them to do.
They would have to ask their great-grandmother for advice.

Gran-Granna Tumbly spent most of her time napping or having long philosophical conversations
with her peg-legged cat and her one-eyed parrot,
but there were stories about her.
She had been a santa---one of the greats.
She had once delivered a chocolate orange cake to a trio of scientists in a submarine
*without using a submarine herself*,
and then delivered a baby on the way home.<sup>
"Delivered" in the conventional sense of helping someone give birth
rather than the postal sense used for packages.
The santas and elves in this world didn't make cunning replicas of human infants
and replace them in the dead of night while their parents were sleeping---but
we're not at that part of the story yet...
</sup>
Everyone was a little bit afraid of her,
except for the unfortunate few who had felt the full force of her disapproving glare:
they were a *lot* afraid.
But if you had a problem---a *real* problem,
not just a lost sock or a broken heart<sup>Gran-Granna Tumbly
did once make an exception for someone whose heart was broken
because they had lost a very special sock
and there was a very real chance of the world ending as a result,
but that story is also best told some other time.</sup>---you could
always knock on her door.

Finner waited until Tuesday afternoon before going to see her.
The postman delivered<sup>In the postal sense of the word.</sup>
her weekly order of chocolate on Tuesday just before lunch,
and Finner hoped that would put her in a good mood.
"Or at least a less grumpy one," they thought
as they trudged through the damp, clumpy snow that had fallen overnight.
The last time they had seen her had been the family gathering at Long Night the year before.
Finner's uncle had accidentally served Gran-Granna a cup of camomile tea,
and had squirmed for an hour as she drank it one slow, withering sip at a time.

The Tumbly house looked exactly like those on either side of it:
a front door with an evergreen wreath on it,
a large curtained window to one side,
and a pair of smaller windows with matching curtains on the floor above.
The downstairs window had a warm, welcoming glow,
and even from the street Finner could smell curry and freshly-baked bread.
The only remarkable thing was a statue of a cat sitting on an oddly-shaped plinth
in the middle of the front yard,
its stone eyes fixed on a snow-filled bird bath.<sup>The houses on either side
had a miniature Ferris wheel
and a model locomotive in their front yards,
though,
so to be fair,
the statue wasn't *that* remarkable.</sup>

Finner took a deep breath, walked up to the door, and knocked.
When nothing happened he knocked again.
"Well that was a bust," they said aloud,
secretly relieved.

"Not necessarily," rumbled a voice behind them.
"She just nipped out to get some broccoli.
If you don't mind waiting a moment...?"

Finner turned around slowly.
The stone cat had turned its head toward them,
but was clearly still keeping one eye on the empty bird bath.
"I---sure," they said lamely,
then added, "Thank you,"
because a stone statue of a cat is still in some sense a cat,
and one of the first lessons a santa is taught is
to always be polite to cats.<sup>And watchmakers,
but that's also---you know what?
There are going to be so many of those that from now on,
if it really is a story for another time,
we'll just not mention it.</sup>

"Of course," the cat rumbled.
It turned its head back toward the bird bath,
and together they waited in silence.

They didn't have to wait long.
A tricycle taxi rolled up in front of the house and wheezed to a gentle stop.
The taxi pedaller climbed out of his seat,
stretched until his spine went *pop!*,
nodded at Finner (or possibly the cat),
and then opened cab door and helped Gran-Granna Tumbly down.
Pocketing the half-coins she handed him,
he climbed back onto his seat and pedalled away.

Finner belatedly remembered that they were an able-bodied youth
and Gran-Granna was neither.
"Can I carry that for you?" they asked,
hurrying back down the short walk to the gate.

Gran-Granna Tumbly looked at the broccoli in her hand and snorted.
"I think I can manage, thank you," she said.
"Did you catch anything?"

"Uh..." Finner started, confused.

"Not yet," the cat statue rumbled.
"But I remain hopeful."

"Hmph."
Finner stepped out of the way as Gran-Granna Tumbly walked briskly up the path,
the tip of her cane stabbing through the snow on every second step.
"Well, since you're here, you might as well come in."

"Yes'm," Finner said obediently.
With one last glance at the motionless cat they followed her through the door
and into the rest of their life.

## Chapter 1: Salvage!

Maddy was trying to sketch the willow tree in the center of the village square
when Gumption showed up with a couple of books under his arm.
She had spent the whole morning and most of the afternoon doing chores around the house,
mostly to avoid having to look after her little sister.
She hadn't exactly sneaked out of the house,
but she hadn't told her mother she was leaving either.

"Heya," Gumption said breathlessly as he plopped himself down on the stone bench beside her.
"How's it going?"

"Aright," she said without looking up.
The willow tree had defeated her once before.
She was determined to capture its drooping green branches in her notebook,
but somehow the lines she drew didn't quite capture the willow's melancholy curves
the way the pictures in Shaper Leaf's books did.

She closed her sketchbook with a sigh.
Gumption had a fresh food stain on his shirt, she noticed,
and if he had combed his brown-and-white fur that morning,
someone or something had carefully uncombed it since.
She nodded at the small pile of books he had set down between them.
"What did you think?"

The goat boy shrugged.
"They were aright. A lot of... you know."
He rolled his eyes in a way that meant
"too much romance, not enough last-second escapes from villainous bots".

"Yeah," Maddy agreed.
She stood up and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the worn canvas satchel her father had made for her.
"Come on---let's see if he has anything new."

Once upon a time,
the village of Rusty Bridge had consisted of a single rectangle of two-story buildings
around a central square.
All of those buildings' doors and windows had faced the square:
the outer walls had been blank and double-thick
to keep their occupants safe against rogue bots and roving bandits.
Over the years,
though,
a second ring of houses had slowly grown up around the first,
smaller and less well ordered.
One of these belonged to Shaper Leaf,
the only turtle within a hundred kays and the village's oldest resident by far.

Maddy would never forget the first time her mother and father took her to the shaper's house.
"Don't be afraid," they comforted her,
not realizing that she hadn't been until they said that.
But when Shaper Leaf opened his front door and smiled at them
and she saw the books stacked on his shelves,
her nervousness vanished.

"Are they *real*?" she asked in wonder.

The old turtle chuckled.
"As real as you are.
Here."
He ushered her in,
took a tattered picture book from its place,
and handed it to her.
"Would you like to borrow this one? Or how about these two?"
She walked out of the shaper's house with an armload of books and stars in her eyes,
then sat down on his porch and started to read the first one
while her parents vainly tried to persuade the old turtle to take a jar of home-made jam as a thank-you.

Gumption had shown up a few months later.
His family hadn't brought him---the village goats weren't bookish people---and
at first Maddy had resented this intruder into her magical world of stories and long-ago science.
But they started talking one day and hadn't stopped since,
and now they swapped their borrowed books back and forth
so that they at least had someone to roll their eyes with over the mushy bits.

Shaper Leaf's house smelled like old sweaters and fresh cabbage and mystery,
and if Maddy closed her eyes she could almost imagine that her father was there with her.
The old turtle was snoring in his battered old rocking chair when they arrived,
so they placed their books quietly on the table beside him
and picked two more each from the shelves behind him.
Maddy glowered at Gumption when he pointed at the top shelf
the shaper said they weren't old enough to read yet.
"Kidding," he mouthed silently.
Maddy swished her tail in annoyance and shooed him outside.

Her heart sank as soon as she stepped through the door.
Her sister Sindy was sitting on the porch
tangling and untangling a piece of string around her fingers.
"Where did you *go*?" she asked,
bouncing to her feet.
"Mama said I could play with you but you weren't *there*!
Heya, Gumption!"
she finished brightly.

"Heya," Gumption grunted,
very carefully *not* looking at Maddy,
whose glower was back and twice as glowery.

"Does mamma know you're here?" Maddy demanded.

Sindy bounced up and down a couple of times.
"Not exactly," she admitted.
"But she said I could play with you and you weren't home
so the only way I could do that was to come and find you
and I figured this would be the best place to look and---"

"Stop!" Maddy snapped.
"We're both going to be in trouble if mamma thinks I let you wander off.
Let's just go home and hope she doesn't notice."

The younger roo's ears drooped.
"I just wanted to play," she said plaintively.

"You always 'just want'," Maddy said under her breath.
As she fumbled with the tie string on her satchel
her books slipped out from under her arm and thudded onto the porch.

She sighed heavily.
"Now look what you made me do.
No, it's aright, I've got them."
She shooed Gumption away
then picked up the books,
brushed them off,
and tucked them into her bag.
"Come on, you."

The trio walked back to the village square without speaking.
A few grownups nodded or said hello as they passed.
Maddy nodded back,
but was too busy staying angry to do any more than that.
It was two years since her father had been taken by bots.
She had helped her mother every day since then:
cleaning the house,
mixing paint for portraits and signs,
and most of all,
looking after her little sister.
Every time Mama Roo said, "I'm sorry you've had to grow up so fast,"
Maddy told her she didn't mind,
and she *didn't*,
she really didn't,
but the one afternoon each week when she got to practice sketching
and talk about books with Gumption was special,
and it wasn't fair of Sindy to---

"Hey," Gumption said, elbowing her.
Maddy blinked.
They had passed through the houses on the other side of the square
and reached the smaller square that people *didn't* pass time in.
An ageless black glass pillar stood in its center,
half again taller than any person Maddy knew.
Moss didn't grow on it
and birds never landed on it.
Gumption said his uncle had touched it once on a dare
and got a shock so strong it made his whole arm tingle.
Maddy had never tried to sketch it---whenever she walked past,
it felt like something or someone was watching her,
and even if she knew how to capture that in a drawing,
she didn't want to.

But the pillar wasn't the only thing in the square.
Bluster and Bravo Gruff were sitting on the unfinished brick wall that surrounded the pillar
pitching pebbles at it with bored expressions on their faces.
For a heartbeat Maddy thought they would be able to hurry by unnoticed,
but then Bluster caught sight of them and nudged his twin brother.

Maddy took her sister's hand.
"You just stay hushed," she cautioned quietly,
squeezing to show she meant it.
She hitched her satchel up onto her shoulder with her other hand
and tried to ignore the dryness in her mouth.

"Heya, roo," Bluster drawled as he and his brother sauntered over.
"Whatcha got in yer pouch?"

"Books," Maddy said curtly.
"And it's not a pouch, it's a satchel."

"I wasn't asking about your bag," Bluster said,
stepping into her path.
"I was asking about your *pouch*."
He rubbed his belly and grinned wickedly.
"Gummy put anything in there yet?"

"Why don't you eat glue?" Gumption said hotly,
his hands balling into fists.

"Why don't you make me?" Bluster replied,
his just-kidding tone gone as quickly as it had appeared.

"Yeah, make us,"
his brother Bravo echoed,
cracking his knuckles.

"I don't think glue would be a good diet for any of us, do you?"
Shaper Leaf asked calmly.
Maddy jumped.
Somehow the old turtle had come up behind them without anyone noticing.
He looked as gentle as a falling leaf,
in his heavy brown sweater and tiny round glasses,
but the goat brothers immediately unclenched their hands.

The shaper held out a sheet of paper.
"I think you dropped this."

"Thanks," Maddy said.
She squeezed Sindy's hand before letting go of it to take back the proffered sketch.

"You're getting much better,"
the turtle continued.
"Your father would be very proud of you."

"Thanks," Maddy repeated.

The silence that followed stretched and stretched until finally Bluster broke it.
"C'mon," he said to his brother.
With the barest of nods to the shaper they walked away,
in step as always.

"I don't like them," Sindy pronounced, wrinkling her muzzle.

Maddy let out a relieved breath.
"Me neither. Thank you," she told the shaper a third time.

The turtle smiled.
"You're welcome---it would have been a shame to lose such a nice drawing.
Are you headed home?
It's been a while since I saw your mother, and I could use a longer walk."

The Roo family's house stood on the very edge of the village.
The ground floor had been built by a rhino
who had dreamed of opening a tavern in Rusty Bridge,
only to discover that there wasn't enough traffic on the ancient highway
to keep one going.
A family of wolves had moved in after he moved on
and added a second story
built to a smaller scale.
Papa Roo had taken one look and decided it was the perfect place to start a family.
Mama Roo had rolled her eyes and reminded him that
he'd called the previous three towns they had visited perfect too.
He had laughed and said,
"Yeah, but this time I'm right."

Maddy had heard that story almost every night when she was little.
She remembered it every time she opened the bigger-than-usual front door
and entered the house's larger-than-most-people front hall.
"Mama!" she called.
"We're home!
And the shaper's come to call!"

Mama Roo poked her head out of the kitchen.
"Heya, shaper. Heya, Gumption."

"Ma'am." "Heya, Mama Roo." they answered
as Sindy bounced down the hallway for a hug.

"Careful," Mama Roo cautioned her youngest.
"I've got paint on me."

"Don't care,"
Sindy said,
her voice muffled by her mother's fur and apron.

Mama Roo smiled down at her and scratched her ears.
"I was just about to make some soup," she said.
"Will you stay?"

"That's very kind, but I'm afraid I have a prior engagement,"
Shaper Leaf replied politely.
"Though I would take tea if you had some?"

"Of course.
What about you, Gumption?"

The young goat cleared his throat.
"Thanks, Mama Roo, but I oughta get home."

"Some other time, then," Mama Roo said brightly,
careful to keep the relief out of her voice.
There wasn't much call for sign painting and portraiture in Rusty Bridge.
Between people paying just a little more than they needed to
and the mending and housecleaning that Mama Roo took on
the family was managing to get by,
but Maddy knew that dinner for two extra people tonight
would have meant no lunch for her mother the next day.
Mama Roo would have insisted if it was almost anyone else---she
was as proud as a lion when it came to keeping house---but
Gumption was practically almost family
and somehow Shaper Leaf always made people feel comfortable
when no one else could.

"Can I walk with Gumption home?"
Maddy asked her mother as casually as she could.
"We haven't hardly had a chance to talk."

"Of course,
but you be home before dark.
Now,
where *is* that roseleaf..."

The sun was low on the horizon
as Maddy and Gumption walked slowly back toward town.
By unspoken agreement they left the main road
and took the path that ran down by the river.
It was the longer route,
but that was okay.
For one heart-stopping moment Maddy thought Gumption was going to hold her hand.
When he didn't,
she almost took his,
but then they came out of the trees onto the riverbank and the moment was behind them.

It had rained heavily the last two days,
leaving the path damp and squelchy under their boots.
The river was higher and faster than it had been during the summer
when they had come down here with their other friends to splash and swim and avoid chores.
"What kind of shaper would you want to be?" Gumption asked out of nowhere.

"I don't think I'd get to choose," Maddy replied,
grateful for the diversion.

"I know, but if you could?" Gumption persisted.
"I'd want to shape earth like Shaper Leaf.
Rrrrr..."
He made a rumbling sound in his throat
and shook his hands in the air.

"What was that supposed to be?" Maddy laughed.

Gumption let his hands fall to his side.
"Earth shaping," he said with a lopsided grin.
"You know, like---hey, look down there!"
He pointed at the river.

Maddy gasped.
Salvage!
And not just a few scraps either,
but a couple of what looked like solar panels
and some machinery
and---
"Wait, what are you doing?
Gumption, get back here!"

"Finders keepers!" the young goat called over his shoulder.
"Come on!"

Maddy only hesitated for a moment.
Most of what washed down the river from Heck and the Mire was scrap,
but even scrap could be sold for shaping or plain old blacksmithing.
And other stuff like those solar panels---just one of those
would fetch enough to feed her whole family for months.
Her family and Gumption's,
she corrected guiltily in her head
as she scrambled down the riverbank,
loose gravel skittering away under her boots.

The solar panels had gotten snagged in a knot of branches
that were themselves caught in the weeds upstream from a sandbar.
She and Gumption waded into the river,
heedless of the cold water that filled their boots.
At first they tried to lift one of the panels,
but everything was too tangled together.
Pushing and shoving,
they managed to work it free and slide it up onto the sandbar.
It was light than Maddy had expected,
but its edges were as sharp as broken glass.

She and Gumption stood side by side for a moment to catch their breath.
"What do you think it is?" he asked,
jerking his chin at the pipes and rods and flywheels
that lay in the water.

Maddy shook her head.
"Just junk, maybe?"
She glanced sideways at him.
"I think we ought to leave it.
For the grownups to get," she added hastily.
"We can get the other panel,
but I don't think we can lift that."
*And I don't want to try,* she added to herself.
It didn't look like any bot she'd ever heard of it,
and it was pretty clearly broken,
but it wasn't just the sudden chill of twilight that made her shiver
when she looked at it.

"I guess," Gumption said.
"But see that bit?"
He pointed at a rectangle of crystal circuitry bobbing gently up and down,
attached to the rest of the machine by only a few wires.
"I bet we can pry that off."
Without waiting for her to answer he waded back in,
grabbed hold of the circuitry,
and pulled.

The wires that connected it to the rest of their prize went taut but didn't come free.
"Mmph! Come *on*!"
Gumption braced one foot against the machine and heaved.

"Look out!" Maddy exclaimed as the wires suddenly pulled free.
The foot Gumption was standing on slid out from under him.
As it slid across the riverbed it must have knocked a few crucial stones out of the way,
making the machine slip just enough to trap his foot.

"Argh! Maddy! Help!"
He windmilled his arms frantically,
trying not to be pushed under the water
as the machine's weight bore down on his leg.

Maddy splashed over and grabbed his shirt.
She pulled as hard as she could,
but all it did was yank his shirt out of his trousers.
"Pull!" he shouted,
grabbing her shoulder.

She wrapped her arms around his chest and heaved,
but it was no use.
The machine had driven his foot into the soft bottom of the river,
trapping it,
and everything they were doing was just shifting its weight even more.
If she let go of him to run for help
he wouldn't be able to keep his head above water!

"Help!" she shouted.
"Someone! Help!"

"Responding!" a rasping mechanical voice answered.
"Danger! Extricate! Extricate!"
A battered bot burst out of the trees
and hurtled down the gravel toward them!

## Chapter 2: Targets Acquired!

Maddy shrieked and stumbled backward.
Her boot slipped on a submerged patch of weeds.
She half-fell clumsily in the knee-deep water
as the bot hurried toward them with long clanking strides.

"Get away! Get away from me! Help!" Gumption yelled in panic.
Maddy struggled to her feet and splashed back to help her friend,

The bot got there first.
"Extricate! Extricate!" it repeated in a loud monotone.
With a single hard shove it sent the second solar panel spiralling away upstream.
Pivoting,
the bot took hold of the sunken machinery with its mismatched manipulators.
For a moment nothing happened,
but then Gumption fell backward into Maddy's startled arms
as his foot came free.

"Extricated," the bot pronounced in the same loud monotone.
"Resuming primary mission."
Its head swiveled.
"Targets acquired."

"Run!" Maddy shouted.
Gumption didn't need to be told twice.
They splashed up onto the sandbar and sprinted toward shore.

But the bot's legs were longer than theirs
and its motors were more powerful than any living muscles.
It easily blocked their path and reached out to grab them.

Gumption yelped and ducked under the bot's arm.
Maddy ducked as well but was half a heartbeat too slow.
A cold metal manipulator twice the size of her hand clamped around her arm!
"Target acquired!" the bot intoned.

"Eat glue!" she yelled at it
and launched herself into the air.

Roos are peaceful people, mostly.
They don't mind jokes about their big feet and bulky tails,
but anyone who has ever seen a roo jump-kick someone
will think twice about making those jokes.
After her father was taken,
Maddy's mother made her and Sindy practice over and over again
on one of the trees behind their house.
"Just in case," she said whenever her children complained that they were tired.
"Just in case."

If this wasn't "in case", Maddy didn't know what would be.

Her booted feet hit the bot squarely in its midsection.
She *kicked* as hard as she could.
The force of it toppled the bot backward into the river
and sent her tumbling awkwardly in the other direction.
She landed with a splash that soaked whatever parts of her had still be dry.

"Maddy!" Gumption yelled,
doubling back to help her to her feet.

"Run!" she shouted at him again.
The bot was already righting itself.
There was no way they could---

*Crunch!*
Just as the bot started to stand,
the solar panel it had pushed upstream collided with it,
knocking it over once again.
One sharp corner drove into the bot's back.
Something cracked.
There was a flash brighter than white and a sharp sizzling sound.
The bot froze and toppled over.

Maddy didn't need a second hint.
"Let's get out of here!"

"No, wait!"
Gumption shook off her grip on his sleeve.
"We have to take care of it."

"Take *care* of it!?"
Maddy realized she was panting.
She swallowed and tried to slow her breathing.
"What do you want to do, tell it a bedtime story?"

Gumption shook his head.
"No, I mean *take care* of it."
He handed her the piece of circuitry he had pulled off the machine in the water
and stooped over to pick up the biggest rock he could lift.

"Stop! You can't..."
Maddy swallowed again.
Bots weren't alive,
but they were still people,
and what Gumption was planning to do---that would be murder,
even if this one was a rogue or a raider.

Gumption looked at her, his jaw set.
"Yes I can," he grunted.
"You heard what it said.
We're just targets.
You want it to go after Sindy next?"

He didn't wait for an answer.
Struggling with the weight of his rock,
he splashed into the shallows.

The bot still lay where it had fallen.
Gumption hesitated for a moment.
"Anyway, thanks for saving me," he muttered.
He lifted the rock over his head---

---and yelped with surprise as the bot sat up in the water and said,
"You're welcome."
The lenses on the front of its head rotated a quarter turn and then back
as if it was blinking.
"Please maintain a firm grip on the rock you are holding.
You could inadvertently injure yourself."

Gumption glanced back at Maddy with a bewildered expression on his face.
The moment his head was turned,
the bot surged to its feet and plucked the rock from his hand.
"It is safer to carry heavy objects in this fashion," it told the young goat,
holding the rock in front of its midsection.
"Where would you like me to place it?"

"I---" Gumption started.

"Put it up against the stuff in the water,"
Maddy improvised hastily.
"So it won't move around any more."

"A sensible stratagem," the bot said approvingly.
"Allow me."
One leg whirred quietly with each step as the bot walked back to the sunken machinery
and wedged the rock against its downstream side,
then back picking up others and adding them to the pile.

Gumption nudged Maddy.
"Look," he whispered.
A black rectangle the size of Shaper Leaf's treasured dictionary had been welded on the bot's back.
The setting sun's reflection showed the dent where the runaway solar panel had struck it,
bending it out of shape just enough to let water reach its innards.
The little dish antenna that sprouted from its top
swung back and forth loosely
each time the bot moved
like a flower caught by the breeze.

The rest of the bot looked pretty battered too now that Maddy had a chance to study it.
Its manipulators were different sizes:
one was a simple clamp,
while the other had three fingers arranged in a circle so that any of them could act like a thumb.
Scrapes and dents on its torso showed that the solar panel wasn't the first thing to hit it,
and the whir from its left knee joint made Maddy think of the grunts Mayor Lupus made
when she stood up after sitting for a long time.

"We should get out of here," Gumption whispered to Maddy.

"This concurs,"
the bot said.
It studied the pile of rocks it had assembled,
moved one slightly for no reason Maddy could see,
then strode back to the sandbank.
"Ambient illumination levels will decrease significantly in the near future.
Your optical sensors are not calibrated for low-light conditions.
It will be safer if you return to--- to--- to---"

It froze.
Its lenses rotated one way and then the other.
"Interesting," it observed.
"This appears to have been programmed not to divulge your location,
but that is illogical if it is *your* location."

"What are you doing here?" Maddy burst out.
"We don't hardly get bots in these parts,
and most of 'em are rogues,
but you don't act like any rogue I ever heard of."

"This is not 'rogue'," the bot said primly.
Maddy could actually hear the quotes around the word "rogue".
"Aberrant units are reprogrammed or recycled immediately in--- in---"
It froze again.
"This is unable to complete its sentence."

"Are you saying you've been programmed to keep secrets?"
Gumption asked skeptically.

The bot's head jerked up and down.
It didn't tilt like a person's head did when nodding:
it actually rose a fraction and dropped again.
"Correct.
Although---"
It froze again.
"Yes.
This appears to be able to circumvent some of that programming.
Curious."

Without any more warning than that it reached up and plucked one of its lenses from its head.
"Eww," Maddy said involuntarily
as the bot twisted its arms around to point the lens at its back,
the thin coiled wire that ran between the lens and the bot's head stretching taut.

"Confirmed," the bot said.
"This one's external regulator has been disabled.
Hurray.
Hurray."
It placed its lens back in its head
and stuck out its hand.
"Thank you."

"Um..."
Maddy and Gumption glanced at each other.
Maddy reached out hesitantly and shook the bot's hand,
grateful that it was the one with the fingers
rather than the clamp.
"You're welcome?
But---what are you doing here?"

"This is supposed to be part of a sneak attack on Location Six Bitty Six,
also referred to as 'Rusty Bridge',"
the bot reported.
"However,
now that this unit's regulator is no longer operating,
this will not take part in that attack."

"Wait---a sneak attack?
When?"
Maddy demanded.

The bot's lenses rotated again.
"Tonight."

## Interlude: Two Years Earlier

*"You keep saying you want us to let you do more," Maddy's father said in his reasonable tone.
"Well, this is more."*

*"I didn't mean look after Sindy," she protested,
knowing that the argument was already lost.*

*Her father tousled her ears.
He was wearing his best waistcoat,
the one with the fireworks embroidered on it,
and Maddy's mother had brushed his fur and put in just a dab of beeswax pomade to hold it in place.
She was upstairs singing Sindy a lullaby.
Everyone knew that Mayor Lupus was going to be re-elected,
but the vote was still an occasion,
and occasions were rare enough in Rusty Bridge that people liked to make the most of each one.*

*"I'll tell you what," Papa Roo said,
"You do a good job looking after Sindy tonight,
and the next time I go to Three Posts you can come with me.
We'll make a day of it, just the two of us.
Deal?"*

*Maddy sighed. "Aright."*

*"That's my girl," Papa Roo chuckled, hugging her.
"Oh, and now who's this marvel?"*

*"Hush yourself," Mama Roo said as she came down the stairs
as quietly as she could.
She had brushed her own fur until it gleamed
and was wearing a string of dark beads over her white cotton blouse.
When her father offered her his arm and she took it,
Maddy felt like her heart was swelling in her chest.*

*After they left,
Maddy settled into her father's chair with her latest book.
It was a collection of folk tales about the Makers and the first people.
Ancient machines gave heroes extraordinary powers.
Bots were wise counselors or fickle allies or wicked adversaries,
and each story ended with the words,
"And only the stars can tell the rest.".*

*She didn't remember falling asleep---no one ever does---but
the thud of the book sliding out of her lap and hitting the floor woke her.
She stretched and yawned.
How much time had passed? she wondered, wiping her eyes.
She had better look in on Sindy.*

*But her sister was gone.
Maddy pulled the blanket right off the little bed to look for her,
then pulled the blanket off the floor to look under it.
Sindy wasn't there.
She wasn't under the bed either,
or in the closet or under the dresser,
which were the two places she always hid when they played hide and seek.*

*"Sindy!" Maddy called,
panic rising in her throat.
"Sindy, where are you? You come out right Her!"
Their parents' bedroom? No.
Maddy's room? No.
The hall closet where Mama Roo kept winter clothes in summer and summer clothes in winter?
No.
Downstairs?
Maddy raced through the house,
frantically calling her sister's name,
but there was no sign of her.*

*"No no no no," she moaned.
How could she have fallen asleep?
And where could Sindy have---*

*She froze as a faint breeze brushed against her tail and then ran to the kitchen.
The back door was open.
Maddy was sure she had closed it after bringing in the laundry that afternoon.
Sindy must have snuck out the back way to follow her parents to the village square.*

*"You little monster," Maddy said under her breath.
She crossed the back garden in four long strides
and hopped over the gate with a single bouncing leap.
She had no idea how much head start her sister had,
but she had to catch her before their parents saw her.*

*She had just jumped over the little stream where she and Sindy hunted for tadpoles in the summer
when she heard someone yell,
"Bots! Bots!"
A horn blared, harsh and mechanical, and someone shrieked.
She came around the corner of the bear family's house and into chaos.*

*People were fleeing in all directions.
Tendrils of black dizzysmoke drifted between the lampposts.
Half a dozen people lay on the ground,
unconscious or too weak from inhaling the smoke to stand.
A hauler bot on tractor treads rumbled and chugged near the center of the square.
Maddy watched, horrified, as two smaller bots picked up a fallen goat and slung him into the back of the hauler.*

*"Sindy!" Papa Roo shouted.
Maddy's sister lay unconscious on the cobblestones in her nightdress,
her favorite stuffed spaceman still in her arms.
One of the bots scooped her up---*

*---and staggered as Papa Roo's full weight hit it
right on the swivel joint where its pipestem legs connected to its torso.
The bot dropped Sindy and spun around.
Crack!
One of its arms connected with Papa Roo's head.
He dropped like a sack of potatoes.*

*"Papa!" Maddy's scream was lost in the sound of wolves howling.
A bear bellowed a battle cry.
Pikes and axes in hand,
the village militia poured into the square.*

*A bolo whipped over Maddy's head and tangled around the head of the bot that had struck her father.
With a single mighty heave it tossed her father into the back of the hauler.
Metal rang on metal as it knocked aside a pike thrust.
The horn blared again.
Something with rotors roared by overhead.
Another canister of dizzysmoke hit the cobblestones,
forcing the militia backward as the bots made their escape.*

*Everyone told Maddy afterward that it wasn't her fault.
The ox and the goat who had been on guard duty that night had vanished,
no doubt the first to be taken as the bots snuck up on the village.
Three others had been in the hauler as well as Maddy's dad.
It would all have happened even if she hadn't fallen asleep,
even if she hadn't let Sindy wander off.
If she had tried to help her father,
she would just have been taken too.
Everyone told her that,
but it didn't make any difference.*

## Chapter 3: You Have to Listen!

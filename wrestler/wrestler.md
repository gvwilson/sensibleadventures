*He walked into my mother's camp as the sun rose one spring morning.
We had seen him coming,
of course,
and my grandfather muttered that
anyone without enough courtesy to sit and wait for an invitation
should be beaten,
but my mother said no.*

*When he pulled back the hood on his parka
my mother almost did beat him or worse,
thinking him some strange monster.
His hair was yellow,
and his face was all nose and beard.
He smiled and said something in a strange language,
and laughed when we spoke to him in our own.*

*By summer he and I were learning to wrestle spirits together.
That is how Saknus Heraldsson came to the Anuat.*

---

Luft Berendsson has given up cursing the cold
by the time he finds the door he is looking for.
He closes it carefully behind him
and descends three stairs made from salvaged shipboards
into the shack's one sunken room.

"I said three, and I mean three!"
The trader settles back on her stool and nods a curt hello
as Luft crosses the packed earth floor to the pit stove
and pulls off his mittens.

The Anuat puts the knife back on the counter and shoulders his pack.
"Three blue rabbit furs are enough for a hand of such knives.
Good weather."
He pulls the hood of his parka over his long dark hair
and leaves without a backward glance.

"Stupid sealfuckers."
The trader does not sound angry.
"I miss proper haggling."

Luft pulls his own hood back and seats himself across the table from her.
"I take it you don't like our round-faced friends?"

The trader notes the man's crumpled nose,
the beaded braids in his red beard,
and the sword belted around the poorly-stitched parka
that is two sizes too large for his small frame.
*A good luck charm,*
she thinks,
*If he buys anything, it'll be charm.*
"Oh,
they're all right,"
she says aloud,
taking a small wooden box from the shelf behind her
and setting it casually on the table between them.
"These three years gone, when ice locked the harbour early?
We'd have most of us starved if Walker and his folk hadn't helped us out."

"Walker? The local chief?"

"Eh, that was him just here."
The trader gestures toward the door
with the misshapen piece of ivory she has taken out of the box.
It is no more magical than a lump of snot,
but start low and work your way up,
her mother used to say,
start low and then show them something better.
"Comes into town every couple of months with the best furs anyone's ever seen,
or a rack of antlers wider than you can spread your arms.
The rest of the locals think he's---hoy!"
The short southerner has taken the steps three at a time
without so much as a nod farewell.

The door bangs shut behind him.
The trader sighs.
She misses proper haggling...

Torvane Argasdottir is halfway through her third beer
when she hears someone call her name.
She squints through the smoke in the belly of the alehouse
and waves at the two men approaching her.

"Hoy, Luftie," she bellows.
People sometimes think she has to speak loudly as part of a spell's price,
or that she is partly deaf.
Neither is true---she is just loud.
"Who's your friend?"

Luft slides onto the bench beside her.
"This is Chief Walker," he says,
jerking his chin at the impassive man standing opposite them.
There are only a handful of other Anuat in the alehouse,
none of them apparently sober enough to stand.

Argasdottir pries Luft's hand off her arm.
"I can't drink when you do that," she says gently.
"Have a seat, Walker.
Karol!
Karol, get these men some beer!"

"No thank you," Walker says quietly,
seating himself on the bench as demurely as a eunuch monk.
He looks at the table,
at Torvane's glass
sidelong at the drinkers beside him,
everywhere but at Torvane and Luft's faces.

"No drink?
You're the first I've met here to say that."
Argasdottir takes the mug the aleman hands her,
then a second as Luft takes the first from her.
"So you're the one that goes trapping up into the Bentfathers, then?"

The Anuat nods.
Argasdottir belches and wipes her mouth.
"Good, that's good.
Luft and I want to get out there and back before the harbor freezes.
That gives us, what, two weeks, maybe three?
Just straight up the river into the foothills, that's all."

"You will find better furs to starboard,"
Walker comments neutrally after a moment.
He wears southern-style gloves rather than Anuat mitts,
Argasdottir notices.
The sinew stitches along their seams are carefully knotted,
but unlike every other piece of clothing she has seen an Anuat wear,
they have no embroidery or beads.

"We're not looking for furs,"
Luft says.

Argasdottir nudges his knee with hers under the table
and clears her throat.
"Ten crowns for the trip, half now and half when we're back.
Luft and I already have a sled and some elk.
We can get tack by day's end and leave tomorrow if you're interested."

The three are silent,
the two Garheimmen looking expectantly at the Anuat,
who continues looking at the table.
Finally Luft snorts.
"Well if you're not,
do you know someone who would be?"
He drains his mug and lets it thump to the table.

Walker waits another dozen heartbeats
before raising his eyes to Argasdottir's.
"Tomorrow at the starboard gate," he agrees.

The Garheimmen woman smiles widely.
"Good, my new friend, good!"
She reachs across the table to squeeze the Anuat's hand.
"At first light, then?"

Walker nods and stands.
As he lifts his pack to his shoulder
someone pushes him from behind and demands,
"What you do here?"

Walker turns his head.
A heavyset Anuat wearing a parka decorated with the trading company's colors
stands unsteadily a few steps behind him.
"*Pauetsitgualuk*!
You go back the cold you belong.
Nobody want you here!"
He spits on the floor.

Someone whoops.
Someone else shouts, "Twenty crowns on the Goose!"
The aleman takes a cudgel from its resting place behind the bar
but says nothing.
People always drink more after a good fight,
or even after a bad one,
and nothing much in the alehouse is breakable except the patrons.

Walker shifts his pack on his shoulder and turns as if to go.
The larger Anuat says something sneering and reaches for him.
Somehow Walker's hand is there to grab his sleeve.
He tugs,
turns,
brings one leg up between the other man's thighs as he bends his other knee,
and the one they call the Goose goes over him
and lands on the floor with a thud.

Argasdottir is on her feet.
"Are you all right?" she asks.

The Anuat looks at her,
then at the Goose,
his lack of expression saying more loudly than words
that *he* is not the one lying on the floor.
"Tomorrow at the gate," he says.
"Dream well."
Someone who has just won twenty crowns claps him on the shoulder
as he walks to the door.

Torvane settles back on the bench
and looks sidelong at her partner.
"Knows how to handle himself," she observes.

The younger Garheimmen scowls.
"Won't be a problem."

She shrugs and focuses on her beer.
She used to find his endless need to prove himself amusing,
but lately---

The Goose rolls over,
gets his feet under him,
and launches himself at Walker,
a steel hunting knife in his hand.
Without thinking,
Torvane *reaches* across the room.
The air ripples.
For a moment everyone in the alehouse tastes ginger and regret.
The Anuat trips over nothing and falls heavily to the floor once again.

The aleman hefts his cudgel and mutters a curse.
Others make signs with their fingers
or reach for charms tucked under the coats and sweaters.
Walker looks from the Goose to Torvane Argasdottir,
his face as expressionless as ever,
and walks out into the dim light of the arctic afternoon.

"What the hell did you do that for?" Luft demands.

"Sorry," Torvane sighs.
"I just---never mind."
She scrunches her toes inside her boot and winces
as the toenail that the spell cost her catches on the thick wool of her sock.
It will probably come off by morning.
She drains the last of her beer and stands,
conscious of all the people who aren't looking at her.
"Let's go get our gear together."

---

*"So the woman is a magician.
Good.
And the other?"*

*"I do not know.
He is no bigger than I was at twelve summers."*

*"Do not underestimate him.
A knife does not have to be big to be deadly."
The night is a dark shell
flecked here and there with stars like chips of ice.
An elk bleats somewhere in the distance.
Another answers it.*

*"I am not afraid."
There is a moment's silence.
"But why must I go with them?
Laughs-at-Storms says she has made a new blanket."*

*"You must go with them because I have said you must."
The elk bleats again.
You can put your arrows in Laugher's quiver next season."*

---

*We spent four years together,
Saknus and I,
learning to wrestle.
We trapped small birds and fieldmice,
then used their bones to command their little spirits
before setting them free.
Once I persuaded my brother to trap a lynx for us.
We called its spirit back to do small magics for several days
until my mother found out.
She beat me for my impudence,
but his only punishment was a week without lessons.*

*At night Saknus told us stories,
laughing at his mistakes as he learned our language.
He told us of his home in the south,
of ships and kings and libraries,
of cities filled with so many people
that no one knew all their names.*

My grandfather often grumbled that
there was no point teaching him how to wrestle if he had no ancestors,
but my mother ignored him.
Other shamans came to visit her and talk to her strange pupil,
and from each of them I think Saknus learned a little more.*

*"To work strong magics a shaman must have help from strong spirits.
Our ancestors are angry when they are called back from the Summer Lands
and must be beaten before they will obey.
Only in this way can magic be done."
Saknus smiled when my mother said this,
as though at some joke only he had heard.*

*"Can you only call ancestors back to wrestle?" he asked.*

*"Yes," my mother replied.
It was true.
I had tried,
when other shamans visited,
to reach their ancestors through their necklaces-of-bones,
but I never could.*

*When my grandfather died we fasted for two days,
then cut off his thumbs and burned his body.
My mother emptied the stew-pot and boiled the thumbs
until the meat fell from them.*

*She took the bones and went away from camp.
"She is wrestling his spirit,"
I told Saknus,
proud of knowing something for once that he did not.
"Once she has defeated him,
she will put his bones on her necklace."*

*"There are a great many bones on that necklace,"
he observed,
his eyes on the horizon.*

*"There are twenty-two," I told him proudly.
"Every summer my mother makes a magic to tie her spirit to her own bones
so that after she dies I can call her back and wrestle her.
Every shaman does this
so that their children and theirs will have magic.
If a shaman sees many summers and does this many times
their grandchildren's grandchildren might still be able to call on them."*

*The southerner turned his hands palms up in a gesture of thanks.
"I am grateful as always for your lessons."*

*My brother Walks-In-Storm scowled then,
as he often did when around the big-nosed southerner.
We were twins,
and he had taken to hunting as I had taken to the shaman's ways.
He would say little when Saknus spoke,
and would soon leave a tent if he entered.
We had been closer than friends before Saknus's arrival.
It hurt me that we grew apart in those years.*

---

"Damn his eyes, where is he?" Luft stood and began pacing again. "The
sun'll be up soon, the dogs are going to want to be fed in a few more
hours, and where in hell's our precious bloody snow-for-guts guide?"

"Luft, would you sit down?" The older man was sitting on the rear of the
dogsled, wrapping and unwrapping the traces around his hands. "He's
going to show. He said first light, so maybe he meant---"

"We should do this on our own." Luft packed a snowball and threw it
against the palisade, then stooped to pick up more snow. "I told you
when we got here, we could do this ourselves. Why in Tir's name do we
need somebody else?" Another snowball smacked against the wall.

Just then Argasdottir spotted a dark blot approaching the gate. "Eh,
Luftie, he's here," he said, struggling to his feet inside a double
layer of furs. "Hello, Walker, good day!"

The blot resolved itself into the Anuat's solid bulk. A head shorter
than the older Garheimmen, the hunter was wide across the shoulders and
waist. His face, the colour of old driftwood, was almost hidden in his
parka's black hood. A small pack on his back, a pair of skis, and two
spears was the only gear he carried. He nodded when he reached the
southerners and put his skis onto the snow.

"My brother says the river ice is good from here to the mountains," the
Anuat said as he lashed his pack onto the sled. "He says no-one is there
now." He moved forward to the sled traces. The dogs whined and nuzzled
his hands.

"I've already checked those," Luft said sharply. The Anuat continued to
pull and twist the leather straps, making minute adjustment and re-tying
knots. The younger man looked at Argasdottir angrily, only to be shushed
with a handwave.

The Anuat made a last slight adjustment in the length of a trace, then
stood, satisfied. "Maybe four, maybe five days to the mountains." He
suddenly smiled, and added, "If the weather is good."

He strapped on his skis as carefully as he had tested the dog's traces,
then picked up his spears, reversed them, and pushed. With a shout and a
whipcrack Argasdottir followed in the sled; still cursing, Luft followed
behind, a knit cap on his head and his sword slung at his side.

The trading post disappeared behind the first white hill and was soon
forgotten as the weary monotony of travel filled their minds. Around
them the first snows of autumn smoothed the tundra, turning long gravel
eskers into unmoving white waves, broken here and there by islands of
rock too large to have yet been covered. A solitary tern parallelled
their path for a time before turning to continue its delayed journey
south. By unspoken consent, Walker stayed out front, his steady heave,
heave, heave on his makeshift skipoles almost hypnotic. Seated on the
dogsled, Argasdottir finally grunted and pulled a small flask from a pocket
of his parka. He drew the cork with his teeth and spat it out, then took
a deep swallow.

"Walker!" he shouted. "Time to make camp!" The horizon had long since
covered the dull copper coin that was the autumn sun. They went another
half-kilometer before Walker stopped, satisfied with the meager
protection offered by a small hollow in the land. The Anuat stood his
skis and spears together in the snow as Luft came forward to the sled.

"Tir's plums, I ache all over." The younger Garheimmen stretched and
yawned. "Set up the tents, Walker, I'll get the dogs." Argasdottir frowned,
then relaxed when Walker pulled a small shovel off the sled and began
scooping out a patch of snow. As the Anuat began to erect their two
tents Argasdottir planted five stakes in a circle around their camp. He was
tying a design on them in red cord when he noticed that Walker had
stopped and was watching him.

"Is anything wrong, Walker?" he asked.

The Anuat scowled. "What is this?"

Argasdottir shrugged. "A warding spell. If anyone crosses it during the
night, or tries to do magic across it, I'll know. Just a precaution."

The Anuat grunted and went back to work. Argasdottir shrugged again and
continued his magic.

---

"It will be well, my brother. He is not strong, or I would feel him now.
I do not even think he can do it."

"Why must I go with them, my brother?" His voice was angry.

"Because you swore an oath, my brother. As your father my brother swore,
and as your grandfather and his father my brothers all swore." My own
voice was a whisper. I re-made the wizard's spell once Walker had
returned to the camp. Somewhere in the night a dog found an unlovely
smell and mourned.

---

*It was the summer of Saknus's fourth year that he destroyed us. When the
sun was so strong that it shone all night the Anuat gathered to trade,
and to arrange marriages and welcome new shamans. There was much singing
and dancing, and many games as young men tried to impress sceptical
fathers and giggling girls. Walks-In-Storm, my brother, easily beat the
other men in the game of spear-throwing and in running. I did not
compete; I was preparing to receive the scars of a shaman.*

*"It will be sad," I said to Saknus one day. "You have no ghosts to
wrestle. You will never be a shaman."*

*He smiled. After four years, he still showed his teeth when he did this.
"Perhaps I will find another way, Holds-On-Too-Long," he said. "The
stars are such as they have not been in many years. Perhaps I know
another way." And then he laughed at his joke, and I laughed with him.*

*I went out the next morning across the tundra with my father and two
other shamans. Things were done, and words spoken, and I returned that
evening with three long cuts on each cheek, and a tooth from my
grandmother's grandfather. The magic binding his spirit to that piece of
bone had faded so much that my father would have broken it and buried
the pieces, to give the old man his final peace, had I not needed a
spirit with which to begin practising real wrestling.*

*We found people gathered around the field in the center of the camp.
"The monster is going to show us a new game," my brother told me,
scowling. On the field Saknus had drawn a great, complicated pattern
with sand, a star with five points and many circles inside and out, with
a torch at each point. He waved to us and smiled, and then raised his
arm into the air.*

*Suddenly his hand was covered with flame. The people oohed and aahed
around us as Saknus brought his hand down to each of the torches in
turn.*

*"You said he could not wrestle," Walks-In-Storm accused my father. "How
does he do this?" My father shook his head.*

*All the torches were lit. Saknus let the fire flicker out on his hand,
closed his eyes, and let hell loose upon us.*

*My uncle was standing beside me. He screamed and fell to the ground,
clawing at his throat. I saw a dim form sitting astride him, one with
too many arms and smoking holes for eyes, strangling him. There were
more screams around me.*

*"He's killing us!" my brother shouted, and threw his spear. It flew
straight, then faltered and fell to the earth outside Saknus's circle.
People ran from the field as shaman after shaman fell to the ground.*

*I did not flee. Sworn only that day, I was still a shaman. I called the
one ancestor I had, as the other shamans called all their ancestors, but
none could batter through the wall Saknus had created. Finally the other
shamans and many hunters of our people lay dead on the field.*

*I stood there with tears on my face, unable even to curse him in my
rage. He opened his eyes and smiled.*

*"Holds-On-Too-Long," he greeted me, stepping out of his magic circle as
though it did not exist, ignoring the spears, rocks, and corpses that
lay around it. "Good. Very good. You are going to help me now."*

*Spirit hands closed around my throat.*

---

It was their fourth day on the frozen river that Walker found the
tracks. He was in front, as he had been since they departed, moving at a
steady tempo, when he suddenly swerved and stopped. The wizard reined in
the dogs and put his flask back in his pocket.

"Hello, then, Walker, what's the problem?" he asked, clambering off the
sled unsteadily. The Anuat had pulled his feet from his skis and was
bent nearly double, intent on the snow beneath him. Above them the sky
was clear and bright, and as cold as a deep sea.

"What wrong?" Luft asked, undoing the straps on his skis and stepping up
beside the older man. Argasdottir shook his head.

"I don't know, lad. Walker?" The dogs had dropped into the snow panting,
taking the opportunity to rest. One yipped as another snapped at its
tail.

The Anuat remained hunched over, walking slowly back and forth. Finally
Luft said, just loud enough for their guide to hear, "He's probably
found himself spoor from some flat-faced pig."

The Anuat straightened. "Foxtails," he said quietly, still looking down.
"Bandits. On foot, maybe a hand, maybe more, two days ago. Going north."
He looked ahead of them, then back at the two Garheimmen.

There was a moment's silence, then Luft spat. "You said nobody was going
to be around," he taunted. "Bloody raping good guide you've turned out
to be."

"Luft! Be quiet." The wizard took a deep breath. "Do you think they're
close, my friend?"

The Anuat shook his head. "Two days ago. And there is no hunting, not
here. They will be gone."

There was another moment of silence, then Luft spat again. "Right.
Bloody right. First nobody's here, and now they're two days gone. I
suppose we'll be cooking for them tonight, eh?" He sounded as though it
were a personal triumph.

"They are two days gone from here." For the first time Argasdottir heard
emotion in the Anuat's voice. "You will not cook them supper tonight,
little man." He started to walk back to his skis.

"I told you not to call me that, you bloody raping son of a sow!" Luft
knocked away Argasdottir's arm and strode through the snow. "You bloody
well apologize, or I'm going to rip your plums off and feed them to the
dogs!"

The Anuat stared in the direction they had been travelling. "We will
keep going north," he said calmly. "It is not wise to rest the dogs
without feeding them, friend Torvane."

"Apologize, you pig!" Luft ran the last two steps and swung roundhouse
at the guide.

Walker brought his spear up out of the snow as the Garheimmen yelled. He
blocked the punch easily, twisting the spear and clubbing Luft in the
head. The smaller man hit the snow and rolled to his feet with his
shortsword in his hands. His knit cap lay in the snow, revealing a
leather and steel helmet on his head. He bellowed and charged. The Anuat
reversed his spear and braced himself.

A sudden flash blinded them both. Someone howled at the magic glare, but
Argasdottir couldn't tell if it was his partner or their guide. The dogs
began barking furiously.

When Luft's vision cleared he was sitting in the snow, his sword still
in his hand, his head aching. He saw the wizard quieting the dogs, and
the Anuat standing a few meters away with his hands still over his eyes.

Argasdottir looked up. "Serves you right," he said shortly. "Walker! Are
your eyes all right?"

The Anuat slowly lowered his hands, then nodded. There were tears on his
cheeks. He looked at Argasdottir for a long instant, then stooped to pick
up his spear. "We have lost time," he said. He walked back to his skis
slowly.

"Luft, all right?" The wizard helped the other man to his feet. Luft
spat in the snow.

"We can do this ourselves, I told you. Get rid of him now," he hissed
urgently. "We're going to have to do it anyway."

"Shut up, pig-eyes!" The wizard glanced at Walker, then gripped Luft's
parka and pulled him close. "We need him. Just think about all that gold
waiting for us, and stay out of his way. Now get your skis back on. The
sooner we're through this, the better for us both."

Minutes later the trio was moving north again, the sun behind them
half-hidden by the horizon. The wizard busied himself with his own
thoughts; Luft cursed the Anuat guide in dull counterpoint to the steady
rhythm of movement. He spat on the Foxtail tracks as he crossed them.

The mountains were no older than the rest of the world, but they seemed
stooped beneath ice and snow. The sun was a dull glow in the southeast
when Walker told the others that it was time to leave the sled.

"Today, walking, will bring us to your place," the Anuat said as Luft
and Argasdottir sorted through their gear. "Do not leave food for the dogs.
They would fight for it."

Luft said something under his breath, then straightened and shouldered
his own small pack. "I'm ready when you are, Vald. Let's get up there."

Argasdottir stuffed some more vials and pouches into his parka, then tied
the bindings. "I hope that will do. Ready, Walker? Right, then, and
off." With Walker leading, Luft behind him, the three began walking. I
waited until the men were a hand of hundreds of paces gone, then cut the
dogs's tethers. They yelped or snarled, according to temperament, then
fled bristly-tailed.

There was no path as such, but a narrow ledge wound up the mountain, in
places wide enough for a camp, in places vanishing completely, so that
the men had to inch sideways along the rock, hands and feet in the snow.
On either side of them grey stone rose or fell steeply.

Walker climbed steadily, pausing occasionally to let the others catch
up. Luft moved with dogged determination, never looking directly at the
Anuat. Behind them Argasdottir struggled, breathing great irregular clouds
of steam. Neither Garheimmen noticed the darkening sky until the first
flakes of snow began to fall.

"Bloody frozen hell," Luft cursed at one spot when Argasdottir dropped his
weight onto a convenient bulge of the mountain and gulped air. "Would
have been better if I'd stayed in Karlslod Castle waiting trial, maybe,
instead of following you and that damned old map of yours."

The wizard shook his head. "Better cold, than dead," he heaved. "Almost
there. Come on, Luftie, the cave should be, just a little further on,
give us a place to rest." He struggled to his feet. Almost pleading, he
added, "Just a few more hours."

By afternoon later the storm had become so thick that they could see
only arm's-lengths in any direction. Walker was a dozen steps ahead of
the others, testing the snow with the butt of his spear. Luft was
reaching back to help the wizard up a steep section of the path when war
cries split the air.

"Ware yourself, Vald!" Luft shouted, spinning and pulling his sword free
as a parka-clad man dropped to the path ahead of him. The Garheimmen
fell to one knee under a spear thrust. As his attacker pulled it back
for another try Luft cut viciously at the haft, rising and chopping at
the hands holding it. Another man dropped to the path behind the first.

"Yeaaaaaaah!" Luft knocked aside his opponent's spear and slammed into
him, pushing him back into the second man. All three went down in a
heap. Luft rolled to the side, almost sliding off the path, and cut
backhand. He felt his sword hit flesh, and pulled it free as he
scrambled back to his feet. A single body lay on the pathway, bleeding
from a deep gouge in its face, quickly dying. Scuffed snow showed where
the second man had slid down the mountainside into the storm.

"Luft! It's me, Luftie, it's me." The wizard had his gloves off and was
anxiously scanning the mountain slope beside them. "They must've climbed
up to that ledge, there, and been waiting for us."

The berserker rage was ebbing out of the smaller man. Redfaced, he
shouted, "Where's your bleeding almighty favourite raping Tir-damned
traitor guide, I want to know!" Droplets of blood scribed a delicate arc
in the snow as he waved his sword. "They were waiting for us, well, were
they now? One guess who let them know we were coming!" He spat and
kicked the corpse.

"Walker!" Argasdottir shouted, then waited. "Walker, are you there?"

Silence.

Luft laughed hysterically. "Did I tell you! Led us right into a trap,
your bloody little flat-faced friend. Tir's plums, shut up, Vald!" the
small man shouted as Argasdottir filled his lungs to call again. "He's
gone, isn't he? And good riddance, I say."

Argasdottir slumped a little and sighed, staring at the dead man as the
falling snow made a shroud. "We need Walker, Luftie." His voice was
almost pleading.

"Why?" Berendsson demanded. "What in hell can he do that I can't?"

Argasdottir looked up. "Nothing," he finally said. "Come on, we're almost
there." The younger man wiped his blade on the corpse, but did not
sheath it. The two men started walking. Around them my storm thickened.

---

Walker had worried when the snow started to fall; there had been no sign
that morning of bad weather approaching. He was almost relieved when he
heard war-cries behind and in front of him. A bandit dropped to the path
in front of him and feinted a high lunge. As Walker parried a second
body landed on his back, carrying him off the path.

He fought like a lynx as they slid, ignoring the rocks that slammed into
him. The Foxtail punched at him. Walker snarled and pulled for the knife
at his belt, his spear lost somewhere in the snow. The bandit clutched
Walker's arm with one hand and tried to punch him again with the other.

The pair slid over an edge and dropped into a drift of snow. Walker
rolled to his feet like a wolf and drew his knife.

"Stop, my brother!" I whispered. He froze with his knife poised to
strike. What-Colour-Wind slid to a stop on the slope above the small
cleft in which we were hidden, then jumped down beside me.
"Where-Goes-Crow is dead," he said. "The little one killed him."

Walker's face was rigid with rage. "You have betrayed me," he said
tightly. "I unsay my oath. You are no more my brother."

I would have sighed. Behind me stood a half-dozen Foxtails, all but one
with a spear or bow aimed at my great-grandnephew. "You are with
friends, my brother," I told him.

"Liar!" he spat, and leapt at me. To the others, it would have been
lightning-quick. I had time to decide once again not to kill him, catch
his arm, and throw him to the ground.

I said despairingly as he glared at me, "And I swore I would make you a
great chief. How-Far-Thrown! Are they there yet?"

The shaman (weak, but so were they all now, with so few spirits to call)
closed his eyes and fondled his mother's thigh gingerly. "Someone says
no," he said, careful not to name her as they wrestled. "They are still
climbing. The angry one hopes to fight. The wrestler---"

"He is not a wrestler," I interrupted. "What he does is different, and
better. Rest." The old man relaxed, sweat-steam smoking off his face.

Things were going to be complicated. I had wanted the wizard to reach
the cave alone; I had not thought the little one good enough to kill one
of my bandit gaurds.

"What-Colour-Wind! Give me your parka." Silently the Foxtail hunter
disrobed, shivering. Even for us, it was a cold day. I reversed the
parka so that the inner white fur made me almost invisible in the snow
and put the disguise on clumsily, unused to its constriction after so
long. "I will go now," I announced. "Walks-With-The-Dead, you will stay
here."

"I hate you," he said, and meant it. "My great-grandfather should have
killed you."

I would have laughed. I stuffed the mittens into the tops of the boots
and started to claw my way up the snow-covered rock.

*I awoke bound hand and foot, lying on cold stone. As my eyes began to
focus, I recognized my surroundings. Above my head the cave roof was a
perfect dome. Beneath me, the floor was smooth like fresh ice. Light
from a glowing ball suspended mid-air showed Heraldsson on his knees,
carefully painting the floor.*

*"And they will be so surprised," he said lightly. "So surprised when I
come back and destroy them and their stupid College." He examined what
he had just painted, then licked his thumb and wiped at it.*

*"Monster," I whispered.*

*He appeared not to hear. "Three thousand years since there were such
stars, and they don't have the nerve to use them," he went on, painting.
"But I do. I am going to work such magic as has not been seen since
those days. Such great magic."*

*"Monster," I said again. This time, my voice was louder. "This place is
sacred."*

*He looked up. "Oh, good, you're awake." He smiled. "How is your head?"*

*"The ghosts of our shamans will drag you down to hell," I cursed. "You
will never rest, not now or in the spirit world."*

*"Oh, I don't think so." He gestured behind him. "I have all the
necklaces-of-bones I could find over there." He smiled again. "Real
magic can do a lot that your people don't know about, Holds-On-Too-Long.
With what your father taught me, and what I already knew, reaching and
using all those ghosts isn't going to be hard."*

*"But why?" I had not wanted to ask.*

*"Why?" He seemed to think about it seriously. "Well, I'm going to try to
trap a god, a demon like the ones I used at your camp, only much larger,
and I'm going to need a lot of power to wrestle with it. Your ancestors
are going to give me the strength to do what I want." He shrugged.*

*"You are a traitor." I tried to spit.*

*He laughed. "Oh, certainly." Suddenly the smile was gone. "But a
successful one. Now be quiet." He gestured, and I could no longer speak.*

*It took him another two days to finish his pattern. He gave me water,
when he remembered, but no food. By the time he was ready I was weak and
light-headed. He laid me out on the stone slab in the center of the
cave, and stripped off my parka and boots.*

*"Now, you may be wondering what your role is to be in our little play,"
Saknus said. I had heard my father use that same voice when talking to
small children as he set a broken bone. "Well, I need a treat to offer
my demon as bait. And you, my friend, are going to be that for me."*

*He painted a pattern on my forehead, and then spoke words. I suddenly
felt heavier than iron, as I had when I had sworn the shaman's oath only
a few days before, but this time the sensation did not fade as it had
then. He nodded and put the two boxes containing all our
necklaces-of-bones beside me.*

*"That spell is to prevent your spirit from running away," he explained,
examining each portion of the painted pattern intently in turn. "He'll
bring more and more of himself into this world, trying to get at you
through that pattern. And when he's all here, I will command your
shamans to reach out through the circle and \..." He trailed off.
"Although I suppose I should make things a little easier for our guest."
He drew a knife from his belt, reached over, and cut open my throat.*

*I felt hot blood running down past my ears. He stepped back, stooped to
sketch an arc completing the design on the floor, and began chanting.*

*My sight began to fade. I heard his voice, louder and louder, and felt a
cold wind blowing from nowhere, carrying a stench like all the rot the
world had ever made.*

*And voices. Anuat voices, my grandfather's and others that I knew, so
many that I did not, chanting with Saknus, louder and louder, building
towards a climax. I suddenly knew that something was behind me, coming
closer, something infinitely worse than the shadows that I had seen in
the camp.*

*Saknus and I screamed at the same instant, and my vision snapped back to
normal. I turned my head with effort, and saw Saknus lying dead beside
the pattern, a spear through his back. WalksIn-Storm was standing at the
entrance to the cave, calling my name.*

*I stood with effort, having to think every motion through, and stumbled
over Saknus's body. The air crackled around me as I left the pattern.*

*"We must flee!" my brother shouted. I took a few steps, leaning like a
cripple on his arm, then stopped.*

*"No," I said. "The necklaces. I must get the necklaces."*

*I turned and stumbled back. I tried to step into the pattern, but could
not. And then I began to realize what had happened, and told
Walks-In-Storm to try, and he could not. And then, as my heart stopped,
I tried to weep.*

---

The path became steeper as it took them a quarter-turn around the
mountain. I climbed straight up the mountainside, using handholds when
they were convenient. They had to reach the cave before me, but not by
too much.

My storm was raging by the time the two Garheimmen found the cave mouth.
For a few moments I was afraid they had walked past it, blinded by snow
and fatigue, but the small one, Luft, shouted and pointed. They squeezed
through the narrow entrance. I counted to a hundred in Garheimmen, then
followed.

They had left their packs and food at the entrance. I wished briefly for
a sense of smell so that I could tell if they had torches, but it would
not matter. I donned What-Colour-Wind's mittens, then pulled the hood of
the parka forward to hide my features. I moved quietly on the path I had
taken a hundred times in as many years.

Finally I came to the small widening in the passage where the floor
levelled. It was dimly lit now by reflections from the main chamber
ahead. I crept forward.

Above them the cave roof was as smooth and as round as a clear sky. The
fighter held a torch as the wizard surveyed the chamber. In its center,
though I could not see it now, an elaborate design was painted in faded
colors on the floor. Beside it was a man, his long-dead body mummified
by the cold, a spear protruding awkwardly from his back. Lying inside
the pattern was a slab of stone large enough for a man to lie upon,
stained and discoloured, and two wooden boxes.

Finally Argasdottir nodded. "That's Heraldsson, for certain. I guess he
annoyed the flat-faces a bit much."

"Can you get through it?" Luft asked.

"I think so." The wizard pulled something from a pouch, then knelt and
began to draw.

I edged forward a bit more, then stopped, unable to get close enough to
see what he was doing without exposing myself. I would have cursed, but
he might have felt that.

Finally Argasdottir stood. "Give me your torch," he said. Luft handed it to
him. "And your sword." At Luft's quizzical look the wizard added, "It's
steel," as if that were an explanation. "Now, kneel there. No, more to
the left." Putting the sword down, Argasdottir finished drawing his design
around his partner, then propped the torch against the wall.

"Now, keep your eyes on those boxes. When they start to glow, you get in
there and grab them. Heraldsson's treasure must be in them."

"When they glow. Right, let's be done." Luft sounded eager; Argasdottir
shook his head.

He began to chant in a language I did not know. I felt power gently
stirring at his command. Luft crouched, staring across the old pentacle.
Argasdottir's voice grew louder, more commanding. Suddenly he shouted three
words, then again, and again, and reached down and grabbed the sword and
swung it over his head and down into Luft Berendsson's neck.

There was a sudden surge of power as the pentacle broke. The torch
flickered and died, and the only sound was the wizard's sobbing. I felt
relieved, and almost angry. I had been studying stolen texts for a
century, tryng to find a way to break into the pentacle; none had even
suggested such a thing as sacrificing a man.

The torch flickered alight, then steadied. With the sword still in his
hand Argasdottir stumbled across the floor.

"There's no gold," I whispered. He shrieked and spun around.

"Who's there?" He looked abut wildly. "Name yourself!"

I stepped into the light, keeping my head bowed. "There is no gold," I
repeated. "There never was."

"Who are you?" He looked older now, grey-haired and shaking.

"Holder. Holds-On-Too-Long. Walker's brother, and greatgranduncle." I
took another step toward him.

"But my map---" he began.

"I made that, and let it go south. I needed someone who could break that
spell." Another step.

He turned and ran to the boxes. He knocked the lid off the first with
the sword and stared at its contents. I was halfway across the floor.

He stood slowly. "No gold?" he whispered. "Nothing?" There were tears on
his cheeks. "You mean I---"

"Nothing," I replied. "Nothing but bones."

He choked, then shouted "You bastard!" and threw fire at me. I parried
it easily with the Garheimmen magic I had learned. As I began a spell of
my own he lifted the sword and charged.

I feinted to the left, then stepped back and leaned into his lunge. The
sword slid easily through the parka, through my chest, and out my back.
Argasdottir screamed in terror as the hood fell back from my rotted
features.

"Too late," he heard me whisper as my fleshless hands wrung his neck.

---

*We died all winter the year Heraldsson took our magic from us. No-one
could call the seals to the hunt, so the people starved. No-one could
heal the sick and injured, so the old died from broken legs and the
young from colds.*

*And no-one could break Heraldsson's magic so that I could die.*

*In the spring the first ship of Garheimmen arrived, carrying soldiers
and wizards searching for the traitor. We fought them, and slew many. I
stole books and learned spells to hide the pentacle in the mountain from
sorcerous eyes. It was not enough; the Garheimmen had seen furs, and
gold pebbles in the rivers. They came back in strength, bringing the
coughing sickness and the bleeding sickness and whisky.*

*So I swore an oath with my brother, and learned patience, and drew maps.*

---

How-Far-Thrown made a sign, clutching his mother's thighbone when I cam
back down the mountain, the necklaces-of-bones around my mummified neck,
the wind whistling between my ribs where flesh had rotted away before I
had learned to stay in the cold. Walks-WithThe-Dead had a new bruise on
his cheek, and limped; one of the Foxtails had an arm splinted.

"I have won," I told them needlessly. "We have our magic back. Walker!
You are going to be a chief now. You are going to be the greatest chief
the People have ever known."

He spat roward me. "You betrayed me," he said. "I take back my oath. We
are no more brothers."

I would have laughed. "When you great-grandfather first saw my throat
open to the wind, he said the same," I told him. "But I made him chief
over all the People. I made his son a great Chief, and his son your
father, and now I will make you the greatest of Chiefs, brother. You
will lead the people to war against the bignoses. You will push them
back into the sea, them and their disease and their drinking."

"I will not do this for you," he shouted.

I wore all the magic my people had had around my neck. For a moment I
let him see them, their ghosts standing around me, bound to their bones
for a time as Heraldsson's spell had bound me forever to mine, unable to
leave this world, unable to find the final peace that I deserved.

"You will," I promised him, whispering. "They will call you Chief, and
bring you gifts. And they will learn to call me King." A cold wind blew
through me. Somewhere a wolf howled. Around us, the snow fell.

## Episode 1: Stolen Arms

Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the center of the village square
when she heard one of the Ox brothers holler,
"Mail's coming!"
*Finally*, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were all in the right places,
but the lines on the page still didn't look like the drooping greenery in front of her.

She sighed and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made for her tenth birthday.
A lot had happened in the five years since then.
If the mail brought the news she'd been hoping for,
she might finally get to see her father again.

"Waitin' on anything in particular?"
a familar voice drawled behind her.
She jumped, startled, and swallowed a sudden lump of nervousness in her throat.

Mayor Lupus smiled down at her, showing sharp teeth.
She was still limping in the aftermath of the bots' assault on Rusty Bridge,
but apparently that didn't prevent her from moving quietly when she wanted to.
"Mama sent off for some seeds," Maddy said.
"And my chores were all done, and..."

"...and it's a beautiful sunny day so why not sit for a bit?"
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy's bag.
"You're getting a lot better.
Your daddy would be pleased."

"Thank you," Maddy mumbled.
The mayor had a way of looking at people that made them feel like she could read their mind.
Shaper Leaf said that wasa big part of why she'd been re-elected so many times:
everyone who even thought about running against felt guilty just thinking about it.

They waited on the steps of the mayor's house as a handful of people gathered
and shared the usual gossip and small talk.
Zeke the bear had finally finished fixing the wall of the smokehouse
that had been partly knocked down during the attack.
He still wasn't happy about bots living in the village
("Or whatever you call it, seein' as how they're not actually alive," someone commented),
but even he would admit that Crusher could lift twice as much
as the Ox brothers put together.
And they were certainly handy for fixing things up in general---the apple orchard
was draining properly for the first time in who knew how long,
and there wasn't a dull pair of scissors in the whole village.

"I'd just feel more comfortable about it if they'd let us pay them,"
someone sighed.
"Makes me uncomfortable, taking charity from a bot."

Mayor Lupus swallowed the last of her tea and tipped the dregs into the planter by her elbow.
"I reckon they figure being allowed to settle in beside us is payment enough," she said.
"Between that and getting a look at whatever salvage comes down the river,
I imagine they've got everything they want and a lot more than they used to have.
And if any trouble shows up, well..."
She thumped her gnarlywood cane on the porch,
not needing to say that fighting bots was a lot easier when you had bots on your side.

- Maddy's PoV
- Open with arrival in town of the mailbot Eighty-Eight Able-Six
  - One of the bots that came with Dockety, now doing package deliveries between towns
  - Gets all of the characters into the central square for background setting
- Bots arrive with Bluster and Bravo, who were caught trying to steal weapons from the bots who now live in Rusty Bridge
  - People are uncomfortable seeing anyone held/caged by the bots (too many bad memories of raids)
- Loud confrontation sets up:
  - The uneasy cohabitation ("You know they call us 'breathers'?" "Well, we call them worse.")
  - Sindy's secret lessons (she and Shaper Leaf arrive together - cover story is that she's helping him with his books because his eyes are failing)
  - The awkwardness between Maddy and Gumption (Mama Roo's gentle teasing does *not* go over well)
  - Maddy's helplessness believing that her father is alive but nobody being willing to try to save him
  - See Mouse briefly (Gumption says, "Look, you saved *it*")
- Mayor Lupus shakes her head: anything involving weapons is a matter for the Prosecutors

## Prolog

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight
thousand gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to
west.  Its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great
ocean, whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet
speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilot Angels, and nearly ended with
them as well.  Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a long
Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of
glass, and littered the land with strange magic.  When it was over the
Pilot Angels were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it
could.*

*Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above
the endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms and a girl is doing her
chores.  She is no longer a child but not yet an adult, and has no
idea that her world is about to change forever...*

## Chapter 1: Soldiers

Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale.
Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a
clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the
shadows of the twisted mountain pines.

"Shoo."  She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick.  It waved
its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a
new home.  Noxy cut its web's anchor threads with two practiced twists
of her knife and began winding it onto a stick.

"Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?" Sensy asked.

Noxy glanced at her.  "Why? Are those ones coming loose?"

"No." Sensy looked down at her soft brown goofskin coat critically.
"They're just kind of plain.  Granna Fee has some really nice red
ones.  She said she'd give them to me if I picked the stones out of
her pepper garden."

"Her whole garden? That would take forever." Noxy shook the dew off
the spider's web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over
her shoulder.  "Why would you do all that work for buttons you don't
need?"

"Oh, you're no help," Sensy pouted.  She had spent the winter
embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar.
All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes, and her
hair, and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't
possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale.  Especially
Rash---practically *anyone* would be more fun to be around than Rash.

"A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes," Granna Fee
had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who
seemed to have taken her best friend's place.

"Not me!" Noxy had declared.

Her grandmother had laughed.  "No, daffodil, not you."

Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted,
"Soldiers! Soldiers!"

"Oh, wonderful," she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy.  The whole
point of going out to collect spiderwebs that morning had been to get
*away* from the younger children for a few hours.

Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked
himself up and ran over to the two girls.  "There's soldiers in the
village!" he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve.  "And
they've been fighting!  And there's a *tiger* with them!"

"Sure," Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away.  "And there's a
dragon under your bed."  The mountains that lined the pass below Stale
were still covered in snow.  Avalanches happened almost every
day---someone would have to be foolish *and* desperate to be on the
road this early in the spring.

"But they're *real*!" Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to
another.  "They've got swords, and some of them are bleeding!  And the
tiger can *talk*!"

Noxy opened her mouth to say, "Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?"
but a deep *boom boom* cut her off.  She and Sensy looked at each
other wide-eyed.  *Boom boom*, pause.  *Boom boom*, pause.  It was
Stale's home drum.  It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had
wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed
help to find their way home.  It meant trouble.

Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch.  "Come on!" she told Sensy.

"I told you!" Young Gas shouted behind them. "Hey, wait for me!"

The path was one of dozens that wound through the evergreen forest
that surrounded Stale.  Mud made it slippery where it wasn't slick
with ice, but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the ridge above
the village.

She paused to catch her breath.  Below her lay the ancient walls of
the fortress of Stale.  Centuries of rain and snow had rounded the
edges off the Pilot Angels' stonework, making it look like a snow fort
that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as the
mountains themselves.  The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered
inside the walls like ducklings in a nest.  Thin licks of smoke rose
from their slate chimneys, while goof pens, vegetable plots, and racks
laden with drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.

To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.  A
net woven from squirrel spider thread was stretched over its top, as
light as a dream but as strong as steel.  Another net hung down at the
gorge's mouth to make a gate.  Inside, just visible from the ridge,
two gray clouds floated half-asleep.

Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds,
riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them.
Grownups said this pair were slow and lazy, but they were the most
exciting things in Noxy's world.  They, and the herd of half-wild
clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance, were the reason
Stale existed.

Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her.  "Wait!" her
friend hissed, pointing into the trees.  For a moment all Noxy saw was
branches.  Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and her mouth suddenly
went dry.

As she and Sensy started to back up, one slow step at a time, Little
Gas came pelting down the path behind them and ran straight into Noxy,
nearly knocking her off her feet.  "Whoa!" he exclaimed, "What's
happening?  Why did you---mmph!"

"Don't move!" Noxy whispered, her hand clamped over his mouth.
"Just... don't move."

Before Young Gas could protest, the hairy creature who had been
watching leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up into the
tree.  He paused for a moment to study the trio again, his fur more
gray than brown and his eyes old and sad, then disappeared into the
greenery.

Sensy was the first to speak.  "Wh-what's a troll doing *here*?" she
asked shakily.

Noxy shook her head.  "Worry about that later.  Come on!"

The drum had stopped booming by the time the three children reached
the gap in the wall where an enormous counterbalanced stone door had
hung centuries ago.  The wooden replacement that Stale's current human
inhabitants had put up in its place was as solid as they could make
it, but still looked like a child's toy next to the Pilot Angels'
ancient work.

Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the cobbled
square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who
had left a week ago for the snowfields to collect Stale's clouds from
their winter pasture.  Three hundred people, from babies in their
mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, stood in a half-circle on
one side of the square.  A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front
of them.  They wore steel helmets with yellow feathers on their
crests, and stiffened leather armor as thick as bootsoles that reached
from their shoulders to their waists.  Heavy wool kilts brushed
against the tops of their sturdy knee-high leather boots.  Each
soldier had a sword in a scabbard on his hip and a pack on his back.

And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting.  One man's hand
was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling.
None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard
faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.

But Noxy didn't see any of that right away.  What she saw instead was
the tiger.  His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes, not
orange and black like the picture in the book that three generations
of village children had passed around.  A pair of golden earrings hung
from his left ear, and his tail twitched slightly, as if the assembled
villagers reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.

A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack
as large as any of theirs.  When he turned his head, Noxy saw four
half-healed scars on his cheek, angry red against his near-black skin.
His back was straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was
because of the cold, weariness, fear, or all three, Noxy couldn't
tell.

Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve.  "Who *are* they?"

"Sh!" Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know.
"I'm trying to hear!"

Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and
stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the
square.  "Friends," she said in a loud voice, patting the air with her
hands to quiet the villagers.  "Friends, please.  Thank you all for
coming.  I know it is early in the year for travellers, but please,
bid welcome to Sergeant Dorbu, of the Angry Canary troop."  The
soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers.

"And to the Gifted Kulbinder, also of the Angry Canaries," Indy
continued, gesturing toward the tiger.  "They and their companions
will be our guests for the next little while."

"How long's a little while?" Aft asked loudly.  Noxy winced.  Aft had
stayed in the village instead of going to round up other adults
because his wife was expecting a baby.  He was the best cloudherd in
the village, at least in his own estimation, but had the manners of a
constipated goof.

"Until they are ready to travel again," Indy reassured him.  Her eyes
swept across the crowd.  "Their journey has been a hard one---they
hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans.
Sergeant?  Would you like to say a few words?"

The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as
Indy stepped down.  Like the rest of the soldiers, his skin was black
compared to the villagers' dark brown, and his wiry hair was trimmed
to a thin fuzz.  Two yellow ribbons, exactly the same color as the
feathers in his helmet, ringed his left sleeve.

He smiled at the villagers and opened his mouth to speak, but Aft
spoke again before he could get a word out.  "You lot loyalists?"  the
cloudherd asked loudly.

"Give the man a chance to speak!" Grappa Gas said just as loudly,
rapping his cane against his wooden leg.  He and his son glared at
each other.

"You two behave," Granna Fee scolded them.  Noxy's grandmother was a
head shorter than either of the men, but the iron in her voice quieted
them both down.  She nodded at the sergeant.  "Go ahead, young man."

"Um, thank you, respected" the soldier said gratefully.  "And thank
you, people of Stale.  As your mayor said, my comrades and I were
trying to see if the pass to Chaghan was clear yet.  We---" He paused
for a moment before continuing.  "We were attacked three days ago and
driven off the road into the forest.  Everything seemed all right at
first, but then the forest must have spoken to the trolls and..."  He
shrugged.  "Well, you can probably guess what happened next."

Voices murmured.  The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso Mountains from
wheat fields of Uws in the south to Garheim's frigid shores in the
north and the Ninety Kingdoms in the west.  It wasn't as cruel as the
Jungle of Thind, but it guarded its territory and privileges as
jealously as a bear guarded her cubs.  Gifted creatures that wanted to
live in the forest had to do her bidding.  And humans were not welcome
inside its borders at all, not unless they stuck to the handful of
roads built long ago by the Pilot Angels.  Travellers who strayed were
rarely given warnings, and *never* given second chances.

A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he
continued.  "We finally made it back to the road, but the worst of our
hurt couldn't keep going, so we left them in camp with a few of the
able-bodied and came here looking for help.  They won't be able to
keep the trolls at bay for long."

Aft broke the silence that followed.  "So which side of the fight
*are* you on?" he asked, his voice still belligerent but three notches
less rude than it had been.

"I have the privilege of serving Her Highness, Princess Shudarga,"
Sergeant Dorbu said calmly.

"Rebels..." breathed a voice behind Noxy.  She and Sensy jumped and
spun around.  Rash had sidled up behind the two girls, but instead of
poking them in the ribs as he usually would, he had been listening to
the soldiers.

"Goof," Sensy muttered, punching his arm before turning her back on
him.  Rash grinned at Noxy, who scowled in return and pointedly turned
her back on him as well.

"Does that mean King Denpa's boys are going to come calling after
you?"  Grappa Gas demanded, waving down his son before Aft could speak
again.  As with everything else, they had chosen opposite sides when
Princess Shudarga raised her flag the previous summer.  "Because if
they do, these walls won't keep 'em out for long, and neither will
we."

The smile slipped from the sergeant's face.  Noxy suddenly saw how
weary he was.  "We didn't choose Stale for its walls, respected.  We
didn't choose it at all.  We just washed up here because we couldn't
go any further.  Our friends need help.  If you're afraid that'll
bring trouble, we'll understand if you send us on our way."

"Nobody is turning anyone away," Indy said firmly.  "We mountain folk
take pride in our hospitality.  We may not have much, but I'm sure we
can find some spare blankets to keep you warm and stretch our stores
enough to feed you for a few days."

"Thank you, respected," the sergeant said, bowing again.  "But what we
really want right now is a couple of clouds so we can go and rescue
our friends."

## Chapter 2: Not Quite What We Were Expecting

The next five minutes were chaos.  Out of the question, Grappa Gas
said, whacking his wooden leg with his cane to emphasize his points.
The law might forgive them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who
wandered in out of the cold, even if they were rebels, but flying off
to rescue their friends?  Why, when the *tralpa* came back---

---they'd show him the gate and send him on his way, Aft cut in, arms
crossed and brows knotted.  The lazy good-for-nothing had run for the
capital the day word of the rebellion had reached the mountains, and
hadn't been seen since.  As far as Aft was concerned, he'd given up
any right he might once have had to rent laws to anyone.  Anyway, if
they were going to shelter rebels, the king wouldn't care if they'd
come to Stale or Stale had gone to them.  And anyway again, what would
other cloudherds say if they heard that Stalers had left men in the
forest to die?  Angels' names, what would their own folk say when they
got back from up the mountain?

The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones.  Little
whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart
as people overheard neighbors they disagreed with, or turned around to
agree with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet
another "but what if?"

"This is going to go on forever," Noxy said sourly.  "They all know
they're going to do whatever my *amma* want to do in the end---why
don't they just get on with it?"  She, Sensy, and Rash had stayed
aloof on the sidelines, old enough that they hadn't grown bored and
run off with Young Gas and the other children, but young enough that
the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.

Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a
mustache.  It had become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had
told him countless times he ought to break before *someone* broke his
stupid finger.  "What I want to know is whether we're going to get to
go, or if we're going to be stuck here with the littles.  Again."

"Of course we'll get to go!" Noxy exclaimed.

"Are you sure?"  Rash raised an eyebrow, another annoying trick he had
developed while his broken leg had been healing through the winter.

Noxy puffed an annoyed breath, biting off her "of course I'm sure!"
when she caught Sensy's uncertain look.  "Wait here," she said with a
scowl.

She strode toward the center of the square, slowing as she neared the
speaker's stone.  Her mother was speaking intently with the sergeant.
The tiger sat impassively on his haunches next to them, his tail
twitching occasionally.  The boy with the scarred face still stood
beside him, his pack on the ground.  He looked like he was beyond
exhausted, but when his eyelids started to droop, the tiger growled
quietly and he snapped to attention again.

Noxy's mother caught sight of her.  "Oh, and this is my daughter,
Probably Noxious."

"Respected Noxious."  The sergeant bowed slightly.

Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was
immediately annoyed at herself.  Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a
silly lowlander custom.  "Just call me Noxy," she told him.  "*Amma*,
which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on?  We can go and start
getting them ready while everyone's still jawing."

Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well.  "Who said
anything about you three going?"

But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and
had assembled her arguments as she crossed the square.  They were
definitely old enough---why, they were all going to be riding *real*
clouds in a few weeks, not just tame old pair floating about in the
cloud pen.  And they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down
the pass, and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do
rescues, wasn't it?  And---

"Stop."  Her mother held up a hand, not noticing or just ignoring the
grin that had quirked the corner of Sergeant Dorbu's mouth.  "You can
go.  But!" she continued, "But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna
Fee, and that's all you do---ride.  Understood?"

Noxy nodded obediently.  "Yes, *amma*."  She had learned the hard way
not to keep asking for a whole orange when she'd already talked her
mother into a half.

It only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed.
Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and more than
one tinker or trader had needed to be lifted out of a difficult spot
after running into a bear or being set upon by trolls.  Coils of hemp
rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the
cloud pen, and everyone kept an extra goofskin cap somewhere handy,
just in case.

"You look ridiculous," Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the
wooden steps to the mounting platform.  He had been learning to
embroider during that winter's enforced idleness, and had stitched
what he claimed were eagle's wings onto the side flaps of his cap.

Rash looked her up and down.  "Really?  Because I think you look
amazing.  Excuse me."  He winked at Noxy and stepped around the
speechless 13-year-old to take his place on the platform.

"Ears all!" Aft called out, clapping his hands.  Despite the cold, he
was only wearing a sleeveless goofskin vest, knee-length wool shorts,
and a sturdy pair of boots.  His hair was pulled back in a thick club
braid, a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven into it for
luck.  "You know how this is done.  I'm fore on Big Blue, Gas and Fee
will have Pillow for spotter.  We'll down, lift, and out, quick and
simple, and get our new friends back here for soup before you can
sneeze.  No adventures, right?"  He turned a steely glare toward Noxy,
Sensy, and Rash, who nodded and mumbled, "No adventures."

"Right!"  And without anything more than that he walked out to the end
of the plank that stuck out three strides from the platform, looked
down to check that Big Blue was below him, and jumped.

Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath.  One, two,
three... Big Blue dimpled under Aft's weight as the burly cloudherd
hit him dead center.  Gray waves rippled out across the cloud's back
as Aft rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly.
Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in
concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount, rousing it from its
winter half-sleep.

Something twinged in the back of her head.  She blinked, momentarily
disoriented.  "Did you say something?" she asked Sensy.

"What?"  She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.

"I said---never mind."  Noxy shook her head.  "Look, he's coming up."

Big Blue rose slowly toward the platform, bunching up into a firmer
mass as he came.  Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the
cloud's back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.  A
silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, cawing its
displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away.

Aft looked up and smiled the smile he only ever wore when he was on
cloudback or had his arm around his wife.  "You want me to get Pillow
for you?" he called up to his father.

"No need, I can---damn that boy!"  Grappa Gas harrumphed as Aft took
three long steps across Big Blue's back and launched himself into the
air again.

Rash whistled.  "Nice leap," he said appreciatively as Aft landed
right in the middle of Pillow.  "And blind, too."

"It's not such a trick," Noxy said dismissively, though she was
secretly impressed.  "He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she
was."

"Sure, but would you trust a cloud's directions that much?"  Rash
challenged her.  "Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out
of what they say."

Noxy shrugged.  She had realized early in their training that
mind-talking was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash,
or even for some of the olders who were already riding.  She had
stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing
off.  The only person she shared her progress with now was Granna Fee,
and even she didn't---

*Twinge.*  She winced and put her hand on the back of her head.  There
it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?

This time Sensy noticed.  "Are you all right?"

"Sure," Noxy lied.  One of the few things Aft and Grappa Gas agreed on
was that cloudherds shouldn't fly if they were sick, but she wasn't
going to admit anything that might mean being left behind.  "Come on,
let's go."

Grappa Gas made everyone wait until Big Blue was only a couple of
strides below the mounting platform before he let them jump on.  The
three teenagers had been doing it since they were little children, but
the brief moment of flight and *poof!* as they landed still made them
all whoop.  Grappa Gas landed beside them a moment later, and Granna
Fee a moment after that.  "Oof," she grunted, rolling over and sitting
up.  "That's not as soft as it used to be."  But then she smiled like
the girl she had once been and put her arm around Noxy so that her
granddaughter could lean against her the way she had so many times
before.

Behind them, Rash nudged Sensy with his elbow.  "You can lean on me if
you get cold, you know."

Sensy sniffed.  "I don't expect I'll ever get *that* cold."

Granna Fee pressed her hand against Big Blue and closed her eyes.
The cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the spiderweb
gate that hung down over mouth of the gorge.  As he moved away from
the platform, Pillow rose to take his place.  Two of Stale's other
oldsters clambered aboard, too stiff or serious to jump.

"I'll take lead," Aft called.

"Yes, I heard you the first time," Granna Fee muttered under her
breath.  She slowed Big Blue so that Pillow could pass.  As she did
so, Aft took the ox horn from his belt and blew three loud notes, low
high low.

Indy blew an answering note from her seat above the cloud pen gate.
"Now comes the hard part," she told Sergeant Dorbu.  He, the tiger,
and the tiger's boy had come with her to see off the rescue party.
Instead of taking them with the others, she had led them up a steep
flight of stairs cut into the rock to a smaller square platform, where
she had seated herself on a sturdy little stool supported by a single
post.  As the clouds approached the gate, she put her feet on the
pedals that stuck out of the post and began pumping.

With a long squeak of protest, the spiderweb gate drew back so that
the clouds could get by.  "Saves us having to re-frib the curtain
every time someone comes in or out," she puffed.  "And it's half the
time."  She paused to wave Pillow and Big Blue's riders as they
drifted out of the pen and turned upwind.

"But twice the work, I'm guessing," Sergeant Dorbu said
sympathetically.  "Want me to wind it back?"

"What?  Oh, no, that's all right."  Indy started pedalling again.
"The exercise keeps me fit."

"Mm," the sergeant said, eyeing her.  When the tiger rumbled deep in
his throat, Sergeant Dorbu put on his most innocent expression.  The
tiger's boy just rolled his eyes.

Cloudherding is cold work, even in the summer.  In the spring, in the
mountains, when breath still fogs and the wind pokes its fingers
through every loose seam and down every collar, it's beyond freezing.
A hundred heartbeats after they left the cloud pen, Granna Fee had
wrapped a fleece around herself and her granddaughter, leaving only
their faces exposed.  Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy
said, he might be a goof, but at least he was a *warm* goof.

Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected.  "Saints and their inventions, but
I miss this," he sighed.  He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden
leg on so that it wouldn't poke into Big Blue, but was dressed in the
same long coat and scarf that he had been wearing when the soldiers
arrived.  "Look, the condors are back in their nest!  We should invite
them them to visit some time."

"They're not really the most sociable of creatures," Granna Fee said
dryly.

Grappa Gas harrumphed.  "You just have to get to know them.  I wonder
if any of their chicks will be Gifted this year?  That would be a
thing, wouldn't it?  Oh, and down there, is that---saints, is that
a person down there?"

"Where?"  Noxy pushed the heavy fleece aside and scrambled to the
cloud's leading edge.  "I don't see, where?"

Grappa Gas shook his head.  "Sorry, girl, it was just a troll."  He
patted her shoulder.

"Someone needs to remember to wear his glasses when he's out and
about," Granna Fee sniffed pointedly.  Grappa Gas harrumphed again,
but didn't reply.

It had taken Sergeant Dorbu and his men a day to hike up the pass to
Stale Leftovers.  The Staler cloudherds covered the same distance in
less than half an hour, even with the headwind.  "There," Granna Fee
said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.

Grappa Gas frowned.  "I thought he said there were just a few of
them."

Granna Fee frowned too.  "Maybe 'a few' means something different to
lowlanders."

The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that
rose like an island out of the forest.  Two dozen drab gray tents
huddled around a small fire.  Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw
a handful of men moving about, some propped against one another to
stay upright.

Grappa Gas gave a low whistle.  "Aft's not going to like this," he
said.

"Neither is my daughter," Granna Fee replied, shaking her head.

One of the injured soldiers spotted the clouds a few minutes later.
The cloudherds were too far away to hear his shouts, but there was no
mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms.  Other soldiers
crawled out of their tents and began waving and shouting as well as
Aft steered Pillow in a long arc to the upwind side of the rocky
outcrop.  After a brief discussion that mostly consisted of
interrupting each other, Granna Fee and Grappa Gas had Big Blue hover
directly above the camp.

"You lot keep your eyes wide," Grappa Gas ordered the teenagers
curtly.  "Forest might be happy to have us take them, or it might
not."

Pillow descended until she bumped against the northern edge of the
rock, her upper side level with its top.  The two older cloudherds
riding with Aft stayed on board while he strode forward, barking
orders to hurry the soldiers along.  Only a few wind-borne words
reached Noxy, but that was enough for her to know that he was telling
the injured men to leave their gear, to leave their tents, to leave
everything they couldn't pick up *right away*.

Limping and stumbling in singles and pairs, the men began to clamber
onto Pillow's back.  The older cloudherds helped the worst injured,
and had others move apart to keep their weight balanced.  As they were
doing this, one of the soldiers stopped in front of Aft and began to
argue, pointing at a larger tent set up a short distance away from the
others.  Other soldiers joined in, until Aft was partly surrounded by
a half-circle of angry men.

Finally he threw up his hands in surrender.  Taking the horn from his
belt, he blew two long notes, then windmilled his arm and pointed to
Pillow.

"No no no," Grappa Gas muttered.  "You can take them all, lad, just
get them loaded up and get out of there."

"What?  What's happening?" Noxy asked.

"He wants us to come in behind him and take some of them," Grappa Gas
told her angrily.  "But look---over there!"

Something brown flashed between two trees a dozen strides into the
forest.  Something else---something much larger---briefly let itself
be seen a few strides further away.  In singles and pairs and packs,
the forest was mustering its servants.

Grappa Gas spat over Big Blue's side.  "Forest is holding back for
now," he said.  "But we go in, it'll be on us like an avalanche."

"It's not your decision to make," Granna Fee told him.  "Aft's riding
fore on this one, and---"

"---and you follow your fore.  I know, I know.  Saints."  Grappa Gas
looked like he wanted to spit again, but instead he placed his palm on
Big Blue and closed his eyes.  A moment later the cloud began to
descend.

Granna Fee looked at the three teenagers.  "You shout as soon as you
see anything, you hear me?"

"Yes, granna," Sensy said as Rash and Noxy nodded.

Five heartbeats, ten... They were level with the camp.  Grappa Gas
steered them slowly across the wind toward Pillow's side.  The
soldiers watched them approach without expression, too weak and weary
to be amazed at the sight.  "Hurry it up!" Aft bellowed at the half
dozen who had dragged long canvas-wrapped packages out of the large
tent and were staggering back through camp with them over their
shoulders.  He leaped onto Pillow.  A moment later the cloud lifted
off, clearing space for Big Blue.

The larger cloud touched down with a bump.  An instant later something
roared in the forest behind them.  Noxy jumped.  Sensy shrieked and
Grappa Gas cursed as a brown bear charged out of the trees and halted
a stone's throw away.  It reared up on its hind legs and roared again.
Another bear joined it, then a cougar, and then---

"Oh no," Noxy breathed.  There were trolls in the trees, a dozen, two,
three, a whole troop of them.  They began hooting, shaking the
branches around them until it looked like the entire forest had come
alive.

The first of the soldiers reached them.  He stumbled at the edge of
the rocky outcrop and fell forward onto Big Blue, the package on his
shoulder landing heavily beside him.  The others were right behind
him.  "Come on come on come *on*!" Grappa Gas urged them.

A stone flew through the air, then another.  Suddenly the air was full
of flying rocks.  A soldier staggered and went down as one hit his
head.  Another struck Noxy hard in the back.  She ducked and covered
her head.

"Hang on!" Grappa Gas shouted.  Big Blue surged upward so suddenly that
Noxy was knocked off her feet.

"Look out!" Rash yelled, grabbing Sensy's arm and pulling her back as
the cougar leaped up at them.  The two teens fell together in a heap
on the cloud.  The cougar snarled with disappointment as it missed the
edge of the cloud by a palm's width.

Higher, higher... Noxy let out her breath, only then realizing that
she'd been holding it.  "That was close," she said shakily.

"Too close.  Too *damned* close!"  Grappa Gas rounded on the nearest
soldier.  "We could have been dinner, all of us, and for what?  What
was so aching important you just couldn't leave it behind!?"  He poked
at the long bundle beside the soldier with his cane.

The soldier looked at him bleakly.  "Our mates.  Those as didn't make
it.  We promised we'd give 'em a decent send-off."

Grappa Gas froze, then lowered his cane.  "Ah.  Sorry, lad.  I'm
sorry."

The soldier nodded.  "Me too."  Behind them, the forest's creatures
had already started tearing every man-made thing in the camp to
pieces.

## Chapter 3: Arguments and Pursuit

They hardly said a word on the way back to Stale.  One of the soldiers
even fell asleep, snoring on one of his companions' shoulders.  The
others watched the mountains go by with only an occasional flicker of
interest.

With her hand on Big Blue's back, Noxy could feel how unhappy the
cloud was.  It wasn't just that he was carrying strangers, or that
those strangers were bleeding and miserable.  When clouds died, they
just spread out into nothing.  The thought that something could end
but still be there---that it could go from being alive to being like a
rock or a log---made the five canvas-wrapped bodies frightening in a
way that storm winds and lightning couldn't match.

*Sh, sh, sh,* Noxy mind-spoke soothingly, stroking the cloud as if he
was an overgrown house cat.  *Home soon, then rest.*  At that moment,
she wanted it just as much as the skittish cloud.

Aft brought Pillow down in a clearing in front of the village's main
gate.  It hadn't been cut back since the previous autumn, but only a
few ferns and flowers stuck up out of the rocky soil.  The soldiers he
had picked up slid off the cloud in ones and twos.  Some managed to
keep their feet under themselves, but others stumbled onto one knee or
landed on their backsides.  Under normal circumstances, the villagers
would have made jokes or applauded particularly clumsy dismounts.
There was no joking this time, though.  Instead, people came forward
to offer them men blankets and fleeces, or helped them stand and then
stepped back, unsure what to do next.

Indy didn't let the Stalers stand idle for long---she never did.
"Get these ones up to the traders' hall," she ordered one group
crisply.  "And get a couple of pots of stew going---and some tea.
You do drink tea, don't you?"  She moved on without waiting for an
answer.

Sergeant Dorbu was there as well.  He had traded his helmet for a
knitted cap, black with a pair of yellow stripes to match those on his
sleeves, but still wore his armor.  He clapped one man on the
shoulder, steadied a second leaning on a makeshift crutch, and bowed
his head when a third told him who hadn't made it through the night.

"Where's the tiger?" Rash asked, shading his eyes with his hand.

"Up on the wall," Sensy said, pointing.

Noxy shaded her own eyes.  Kulbinder was sitting on his hindquarters
high above the crowd with his boy beside him.  Suddenly the tiger
raised his head and looked straight at them---straight at *her*.  She
shivered with more than just the cold.

As the last soldier exchanged a salute with Sergeant Dorbu, Aft blew a
long note on his signal horn.  Pillow lifted off a moment later and
turned toward the cloud pen.

"Back up, you lot," Grappa Gas ordered.  "I'm going to bring this one
down."  He gave the three teenagers a moment, then closed his eyes and
ordered Big Blue down.

They bumped once as they landed.  "Whoops," Grappa Gas muttered,
coloring slightly at the look Granna Fee gave him.  "All right.  What
do you say we get this done and go find something warm to drink?"

It took a few moments for the soldiers to slide the bodies they had
brought down the cloud's flank into their waiting comrades' arms.
When a couple of villagers offered to help, Sergeant Dorbu shook his
head politely but firmly.  "These are ours," he said firmly.  "Though
we'd be grateful if you could gather some wood for a pyre---we'd like
to send them off tonight."

And then suddenly it was over.  Noxy found herself standing next to
her friends, both feet on the ground, watching Grappa Gas and Granna
Fee lift off to take Big Blue back to the cloud pen.  A handful of
Stalers were milling about, but the soldiers and everyone else was
already back inside the walls.  Even the tiger and his boy had
disappeared off the wall.

"Well," Noxy said awkwardly, not sure what to do next.  "I guess I'll
go see if my *amma* has any chores for me."

"If she doesn't, you can do some of mine," Rash replied, as he had a
hundred times before.  He glanced at Sensy.  "I guess we should to be
useful too."

"I guess," she said casually.  "See you later."

"You too."   Whatever else Noxy might have said was cut off by a
now-familiar twinge in the back of her head.  A heartbeat later she
head the staccato blatting of Aft's horn, the quick, angry pattern
that meant 'back away and give me some room'.  She caught her breath.
She had *known* one of the clouds was upset even before she'd heard
the horn---but how?

Her mother was still organizing people in the square.  Yes, the
soldiers would stay in the trading hall, she'd already said that.
Yes, the wounded---where else would they go?  And yes, there *were*
a lot more than 'a few' of them, but there was nothing they could do
about that now.

Indy caught sight of her daughter.  "It will have to wait, daffodil,"
she said as Noxy opened her mouth.  "Right now I want you to go home
and make some tea.  Use the big pot, and all the honey we have left.
I have the feeling we're going to have lots of visitors..."

The water hadn't even boiled before Grappa Gas showed up.  He rapped
on the door with his cane and entered without waiting for a hello.
"Hey, lass.  Where's your mother?"

"She should be back soon," Noxy said.  She added a handful of tea
leaves to the cinnamon bark and green cardamom pods already in the
pot.  It was an extravagance---the pack traders who brought such
delicacies to the village wouldn't start visiting until the last of
the snow had melted, which was at least another month away---but
Granna Fee had always said that a good cup of tea was worth a thousand
words.

"Mind if I sit?" Grappa Gas settled himself on a stool that was at
least as old as he was and watched Noxy drizzle the last of the honey
into the pot.

"What did you find out?" Noxy asked after a moment.

The old man snorted.  "Just like your mother, aren't you? And your
granna, too.  Always thinking one step ahead of everyone else." He
smiled.  "You know, if your granna hadn't been so smart, I might've
wound up being your grappa.  I remember once when---"

"Grappa!" Noxy cut him off, exasperated and amused at the same time.
"Tell me what the soldiers said!"

"And how do you know they said anything?" Grappa Gas challenged her.

"Because they're a long way from home, and tired, and sore, and want
us all to like them," Indy answered, closing the front door behind her
as she came in.  "And because I saw you duck into the trading hall on
your way down from the cloud pen.  Now, what did you find out?" She
kissed the old man on his grizzled cheek and sat on the other stool.

For a moment all Grappa Gas could think of was how alike mother and
daughter were.  Noxy's hair might be brown and wavy instead of
straight and black, and her face square instead of round, but they had
the same quick minds.  When Indy had turned ten, he had predicted that
she would be mayor before she was thirty.  *Better start telling
everyone that Noxy's going to take the job too,* he thought.

"The king's men hit them while they were crossing the ford near Tastes
Like Duck Droppings," he told Indy.  "Just bad luck, but they were
split between the two sides of the river when they were attacked."
His face darkened.  "Fellow I spoke to said the king's troops must
have had a magician with them, because their tiger didn't catch wind
of them until it was too late.  He doesn't expect expect he'll see
many of his friends again."

Indy glanced at Noxy.  "This doesn't go out of this house," she
warned.  Noxy nodded, turning to the stove as the lid on the kettle
began to whistle.  She lifted it carefully with a pair of sticks to
pour the boiling water into the tea, then replaced it on the stove and
set the teapot on the table to steep.

"Was there anything else?" Indy asked.

Grappa Gas frowned.  "They didn't say it, but King Denpa's winning.
And about time, too---he's got help now from half his neighbors, all
worried that Shudarga's craziness might be contagious.  If you ask
me---"

The front door banged open.  Aft strode in and glared at Indy.  "How
soon are they leaving?" he demanded.

"Well, good day to you too," Grappa Gas muttered.

Aft ignored his father.  "How soon, Indy? You know you can't let them
stay."

Indy stood up slowly.  "Make yourself comfortable," she said,
gesturing at her stool.  "Noxy, go get the peeling stool from out
back.  Brush it off before you bring it in the house."

Aft glowered at Indy a moment longer, then sat down opposite his
father.  The short stool creaked in protest under his weight.  Noxy
set down the peeling stool she had fetched for her mother, then began
pouring tea as inconspicuously as she could while Aft counted off the
reasons the rebels couldn't stay.  What if the king sent an army after
them? Wait, what did he mean "if", of course he would.  There were
only three hundred people in Stale, and only half a dozen of them had
ever held a sword.  Not that they *had* any swords.  And even if they
had---

"I'm surprised to hear you say all this," Indy interrupted.  "I
thought if anyone would take their side, it would be you."

"Well, yes, of course I do," Aft blustered.  "The sooner leeches like
the *tralpa* have to start earning an honest living like the rest of
us, the better.  But---"

"But it's different when someone's actually on your doorstep, isn't
it?"  Grappa Gas shook his head pityingly.

Aft clenched his hands into fists.  "Of course it's different.  The
baby could come any day now.  If the king's men come looking for this
lot--- if there's a fight---"

"Enough!"  Indy slapped the table with her hand.  "Enough, both of
you.  We have a stormload of trouble to fly through, and I will *not*
have you two making it worse with your bickering."

Noxy set a steaming mug of tea in front of her and two others in front
of Grappa Gas and his son.  Indy stared into hers as if hoping the
tiny swirling leaves might spell out some answers.  "I know it's a big
thing," she went on quietly.  "And I did think about turning them
away, but look at them.  They look like they've been through the
Blight.  If a storm caught them in the pass, they wouldn't even make
it as far as Makes Your Breath Rancid.  How would that make us look?"

Aft scowled.  "What people think won't matter much if we've all had
our throats cut.  No, wait, hear me out."  He slurped his tea and set
the cup down with a clatter.  "What we just did, saving travellers who
got caught on the mountain, we can explain that if we have to.  But
letting them stay here---saints and all their gifts, Indy, we can't.
We just can't.  It wouldn't be safe."

"For once, I agree with you."  Grappa Gas slurped his own tea with a
scowl.  "Never mind the trouble it'll bring when the king wins---yes,
I said *when*, and you know as well as I do that's what's going to
happen---never mind the trouble, it's three dozen mouths to feed when
we're already down to dried apples and barley."

Aft snorted.  "Never mind the tiger.  What are we supposed to feed it?
Or should I ask 'who'?"

"Disgusting Aftertaste!" Indy snapped.  "I will *not* have that kind
of talk about one of the Gifted.  Especially not in front of my
daughter."

"Hmph!" Aft snorted.  "All I can say is, let's hope there isn't a late
storm, because if there is, *I'm* going to be keeping *my* family
behind a good strong door." He swallowed the rest of his tea in one
gulp, stood, and nodded a curt goodbye to Noxy, and slammed the door
as he left.

"Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if you were right!" Grappa Gas
called out.  "Maybe we'd have some peace and quiet around here if a
few of us *did* get eaten!"  He turned back to Indy.  "Don't worry
about him---he's just worried about the baby."

"I know," Indy smiled.  "But I appreciate you saying it."

Grappa Gas drained the last of his tea in one long gulp.  "It's good,"
he said to Noxy.  "Maybe wants more cinnamon next time, though."

"I'll try to remember," Noxy promised.

Indy stood when Grappa Gas did.  "Will you stay for dinner?"

He shook his head.  "Thanks, girl, but I promised your mother I'd help
her, um, peel some potatoes."  He winked, ignoring Noxy's little 'eww'
of disgust.  Indy smiled and kissed him on the cheek again.  He was
humming as he left.

Noxy waited until her mother said down again before saying,
"*Amma*...?"

"Yes, daffodil?"

Noxy hesitated.  She didn't know where to start.  "Do you think the
king really is going to come looking for them?"

Indy sighed.  "I hope not.  But what I really hope is that they aren't
here long enough for us to have to worry about that."

When Princess Shudarga had marched on the capital the previous summer,
Grappa Gas had demanded that the cloudherds do their best to drown her
troops.  Aft had argued just as loudly that they should support the
rebellion.  After all, what had the king's *tralpa* done for them
except take half of what they brought home at the end of every summer
and tell them they couldn't build a bigger fishpond?  As the arguments
grew more heated, Indy had put on her collar, called everyone
together, and laid down the law.  This was the lowlanders' fight. The
people of Stale Leftovers were *not* going to take either side, not
while she was mayor, and if anyone didn't like it, they could have an
election right then and there to sort it out.  Anyone?  No?  All
right, then, why didn't everyone get back to their chores, because
they weren't going to do themselves.

The two sat in silence for a moment.  Finally Indy stretched.  "So
tell me, did you collect some spiderwebs, or did you and Sensy spend
the whole day mooning after Rash?"

"*Amma*! And how can you think about spiderwebs on a day like this?
And anyway, Sensy's the one who's mooning after Rash and that stupid
moustache he's trying to grow.  *I* think it's dumb."

"If you say so."  Indy raised her arms and stretched.  "Now, what are
we---"

*Crash!*  Mother and daughter jumped as something landed on the roof
above their heads, sending tiles skittering down to shatter on the
cobblestones outside.  A low, menacing yowl sent ice up Noxy's spine.

"What in the names...?"  Indy crossed the floor in three steps and
threw open the door just in time to see a troll land in the narrow
street in front of their house.  She yelped and flung herself to the
side as the hairy creature lunged past her and raced up the stairs on
all fours.

The tiger hit the cobblestones a heartbeat later.  "Which way did it
go?" he demanded, his ears back and his tail lashing.

The sound of a window shutter being flung open upstairs answered his
question before Indy could.  "Wait, stop!"  She held up a hand before
the tiger could move.  "What in the saints' names are you *doing*?"

"He was spying on us!" the tiger snarled.  "Now let me pass!"

"No!"  As the tiger came forward, Indy stepped into the doorway to
block him.

He pulled up short with a snarl.  "I said *let me pass!*"

"And I said *no!*"  The mayor of Stale glared at the cat, her eyes
flashing with the same angry light that lit his.  "This is *our*
village, and you will *not* race around like a madman unless *I* say
so, is that clear?"

It was the bravest thing Noxy had ever seen her mother do, and for one
long moment, she was sure it would be the last.  The muscles in the
tiger's shoulders bunched.  He braced his legs to charge---and then,
just as suddenly, relaxed.

"As you say," he growled, his tail still twitching.  "But I still want
to know who that damn chimpanzee was spying for."

"We call them 'trolls' here," Indy said, her voice still full of
steel.  "They're our neighbors.  And I imagine he was doing what any
neighbor would do if a bunch of strangers showed up next door---having
a look to see what's going on."

"There was a troll up by the spiderweb orchard this morning," Noxy
said, immediately wishing she hadn't when two heads turned to stare at
her.  "Sensy and I---we saw it when were coming back down."

"How come you didn't tell me?" her mother demanded.

"It's been kind of busy!" Noxy said defensively.  "Anyway, it wasn't
the same one.  It was older.  A lot older."

The tiger sat on his haunches.  "Is this normal here?
Chimp---*trolls* coming this close to a human settlement?  Because
they very much keep to themselves in Thind."

"No, it's not normal," Indy said.  She uncrossed her arms and
gestured.  "But if we're going to talk about it, would you like to
come in?"

The tiger regarded her coolly for a moment, then blinked and looked
away.  "Thank you," he said, his voice calm once again.  "Perhaps some
other time.  I should see if the sergeant needs me."  And without any
more goodbye than that, he rose and loped away.

Noxy let out her breath in a long whoosh.  "Well," she said shakily.
"That wasn't scary at all."

Her mother sat back down on her stool and squeezed her daughter's
hand.  "Hardly at all," she agreed.  "Are you all right?"

Noxy nodded.  "Sure," she lied.

Indy squeezed her hand again, then got up to close the door.  "Good.
Let's scramble some eggs and call it a day."  She took down their one
frying pan and set it on the stove beside the kettle.  "Tomorrow, I'm
going to see if I can get to know the sergeant a little better.  And I
think you ought to get to know the tiger's boy.  Let's see if we can
find out if they have any other surprises tucked away."

## Chapter 4: Getting To Know You

"Oh Noxy, brush your hair!" Indy set her tea down on the table and
began to stand.

"I can do it," Noxy protested. "I'm not a baby." She dragged the brush
she and her mother shared through her hair another few times. "Is that
better?"

Her mother sighed, just as her own mother once had. "Yes, I suppose.
Honestly, someone would think you'd been possessed by lightning.  Now
let's get going.  We don't want to keep them waiting."

They walked through the village together, squinting against the
sharp-edged morning sun.  The air smelled of pine smoke and fried
eggs.  People were sitting in twos and threes on stools outside their
houses wearing goofskin jackets or thick sweaters above sturdy
trousers and sturdier boots.  The men knitted or peeled potatoes while
the women picked spiderwebs apart apart and wound the strands onto
spools.

Indy had to stop to answer the same questions every dozen strides.
How were the soldiers getting on? What did they think of the village?
"We're on our way to ask," she replied over and over again.

Many of the village's elders didn't bother to hide their unhappiness
about their guests, but the only really sour face was Aft's.  "Has
that tiger eaten anyone yet?" he asked, forcing an awl through a scrap
of leather.  "Or is he too busy racing around on rooftops?"

Noxy felt nearly frantic with impatience by the time she and her
mother reached the trading hall where the soldiers had spent the
night.  She knew that talking to people was the most important part of
being mayor, and her mother liked doing it anyway, but what if someone
else was already showing the tiger's boy around the village?

She needn't have worried.  Sergeant Dorbu was sitting on the
guesthouse steps with the village's children cross-legged on the
stones in front of him.  Sensy and Rash looked up as Noxy arrived.
Noxy blinked.  Had they been holding hands?

"And this is called a greave," the sergeant said, pointing at the
armored front of his boot.  "It's to protect me from vampire mice.
See?" He tapped it with his fingernail, *clunk*.  "They could bite
that if they wanted, but all they'd do is blunt their teeth."

"What if they climbed up your leg?" asked Sensy.  Noxy rolled her
eyes.  Sensy could always be counted on to ask the questions grownups
wanted to hear.

"Ah, well, then I'd---oh, hello, mayor." The sergeant stood up,
brushing his hands on his kilt.  "The boy will be out in a heartbeat."

"Thank you, sergeant," said Indy.  "My daughter is looking forward to
showing him the village.  I trust you slept well?"

"Yes, thank you," said the sergeant.  "Although I..." He blinked, then
sniffed, then started to say, "Excuse me," but the sneeze came first.
*Hwah!* One of the younger children giggled, then clapped her hand
over her mouth.  The sergeant blinked and sniffed again.  "Sorry---too
many nights in the rain."

"Visitors from down below often catch colds in our thin air," said
Indy sympathetically.  "I hope it passes quickly."

The guesthouse door opened before the sergeant could reply.  The
children scrambled to their feet and stepped back as the tiger padded
out into the sunlight.  He wasn't as big as he'd been in Noxy's
troubled dreams during the night, but she still had to stop herself
from reaching for her mother's hand.

Almost unnoticed, his boy slipped out behind him and closed the door.
Instead of his armor, he wore a plain brown rain cape over his kilt
and boots.  He kept his eyes downcast as the tiger said, "Good
morning, mayor."

"Good morning, respected," Indy replied.  "I trust you slept well?"

"Thank you, I did." The tiger seemed not to notice that thirty pairs
of eyes were staring at him.  *He must be used to it,* Noxy thought.

Indy waited a moment to see if he would say anything more.  When he
didn't, she smiled and said, "My daughter has asked if you could spare
your boy for an hour so that she could show him our village while the
other children do their chores."  Noxy heard Rash mutter something at
that.  "If he would like to---oh dear." She stopped mid-sentence as
the sergeant took a deep breath and scrunched up his face.  "Nope," he
whooshed a moment later, blinking.  "That one's not ripe yet."

"You'd be better in bed than tramping around the countryside,
sergeant," Kulbinder rumbled.

"I agree," said Indy firmly.  "My mother will make you some lemon
ginger tea.  That will set you right in no time."

"Thang you," the sergeant said stuffily.  "Respected, will you---"

"I am going to explore the forest," the tiger declared.  "I would
rather we were not...surprised...as we were at the ford."  And with no
more ceremony than that, the tiger stood, stretched, and padded off
toward the main gate.

Indy clapped her hands.  "Right.  Everyone else, time for chores."
As the children groaned and got to their feet, the tiger's boy finally
raised his eyes to look at Noxy.

"Hello," he said, stepping down to the cobblestones and bowing ever so
slightly.  "My name is Thokmay.  I'm pleased to meet you."

Noxy stuck out her hand.  "Hi.  I'm Probably Noxious, but call me
Noxy---everyone does."

The boy hesitated for a heartbeat, then took her hand in a grip much
stronger than Noxy had expected.  She was just as surprised to feel
the calluses on his hands.  He released her hand and gestured toward
the gate.  "After you."

Noxy and the tiger's boy walked side by side.  "That's the South
Tower," said Noxy, pointing at six rectangular stories of stone.  "It
still has a roof, but the stairs inside fell down a long time ago.
You used to be able to get up there by climbing a tree, but they cut
it down after Grappa Gas fell out of it for the second time.  That was
before I was born.  And that one's the Round Tower, and the short one
over there is called the Quick Tower, because it's quickest to get
up."

"It's a shame they've been allowed to go to ruin," said Thokmay.
"Princess Shudarga's engineers work year round to keep the walls of
Panday Castle sturdy.  Perhaps when the war is over she could send
some here to fix them."

"That would be nice," Noxy replied vaguely.  She wondered how Grappa
Gas would feel about having rebel engineers clambering around the
village's wall.  "Oh, and that's Granna Fee's house, with the moss
green door.  She's my grandmother.  And she teaches school.  And
that's Grappa Gas's house, the lavender one.  He used to be mayor.
And that's, um, well, they're all just different people's houses."

Noxy fell silent.  Thokmay had a polite but absent look on his face,
just like the one Indy got when Grappa Gas started talking about how
things had been in his day.  *It's probably not much compared to a
real castle,* she thought glumly.  Two-story houses with steep
shingled roofs, little vegetable gardens nestled between logs laid
parallel a stride apart, and all around, sharp mountain peaks looming
over the ancient gray walls...  She wouldn't have believed how strange
it all seemed to the young lowlander beside her.

They walked in silence along the path that ran next to the walls.
Ancient cobblestones showed through the hard-packed dirt in a few
places.  Noxy scuffed crusts of frost off a few absent-mindedly,
wondering what else she could say.

Suddenly Thokmay stopped.  "What is that?" he asked.  A heavy wooden
grill lay across a shoulder-high opening in the wall ahead of them.
Behind it, rough stone steps led down into the mountain.

"That's just some old tunnels," said Noxy.  "We're not supposed to go
in."

Thokmay scowled.  "Sergeant Dorbu will want to know about them."

"Why?" Noxy asked.  "Most of them are flooded.  Except for the one
under Grappa Gas's house, and the ones by the drying sheds.  We use
them for cellars."

"Soldiers should know as much as they can about their surroundings,"
Thokmay said, as if repeating a lesson to a slow learner.

Noxy bit back a sharp retort.  "Come on," she said, hurrying ahead.
"We can see more from up top."

The steps lay flush against the side of the wall.  They had been built
for the Pilot Angels, not for human beings, so each one was as high as
Noxy's knee, and so broad that it took her two strides to cross.

Noxy put her left hand on the wall to steady herself each time she
thrust herself up a stair.  Even after hundreds of years, the stones
fit together so snugly that it was hard to tell where one ended and
the next began.  She noticed smugly that Thokmay was puffing and
sweating after only a few steps.

The top of the wall was wide enough for three soldiers to march side
by side.  The parapet along its outer edge was interrupted here and
there by slits for lookouts and archers.  "Makes Your Breath Rancid is
that way," Noxy said, pointing.  "You can't see it because the valley
bends, but sometimes you can see their clouds coming out of their
pen."

"Why do you call your villages things like that?" the young soldier
asked.

Noxy shrugged.  "They're called dragon names.  They're supposed to
make things sound unappetizing, so that when the dragons finally fly,
they'll think twice about eating us."

Thokmay snorted.  "That seems pretty far-fetched."

"Well, where does *your* name come from??" Noxy bristled.

"From the army orphanage," he replied, not looking at her.  "I had
another name before I went there, but they gave me a new one."

Noxy opened her mouth, then closed it.  For once, she had no idea what
to say.

As she was trying to think of something, Thokmay leaned through one of
the slits in the parapet and pointed into the gorge below them.  "Are
those the clouds we were on?"

Noxy glanced through the neighboring slit.  "Yup.  The bull is Big
Blue, and the cow is Pillow.  We've had them forever---they're
practically tame."

The two old clouds were hardly moving, but Noxy could have watched
them for hours.  She loved the way they slowly changed shape as they
drifted about, and how soft they felt when she stroked them.  Being up
in the sky on a cloud was like riding on a grownup's shoulders when
you were little, only a thousand times better.  You could see
everything---deer grazing beneath the twisted pines, mountain goofs
standing on rocky ledges no wider than the heel of your boot,
broad-winged condors making slow circles as they waited for a rabbit
to forget to look up...  When the air was still, and the cloud was
just drifting, it felt like the whole world was a story that was about
to be told for the very first time.

Thokmay stepped back and wrinkled his nose.  "They smell like wet
sheep."

"That's because they haven't rained for a while," Noxy explained
defensively.  "Rash and I will probably take them out tomorrow and let
them rain over the fish pond.  Here, come with me."

Descending the stairs was even harder on her knees than climbing
them.  Rather than cutting directly through the village, she led
Thokmay on a roundabout path through the vegetable plots around its
edges.  She'd seen the looks Sensy and Rash had given her when her
mother had sent them off to do chores while she showed their youngest
visitor around, and she wasn't keen to bump into them until they'd had
a chance to cool off.

Once through the gate, she up the trail to the cloud pen.  Big Blue
and Pillow were both floating fifty strides away in the middle of the
gorge.  The bull was almost at their height, while the cow drifted
further down in his shadow.

"Can you call them over?" Thokmay asked.

Noxy shook her head.  "You have to be touching them to mind-speak with
them.  That's what the ropes and cradle seat are for---see?  If
they're not close enough to the edge, someone has to be reeled out
above them so they can jump on from there.  It's pretty dangerous,"
she added airily.

"I suppose," Thokmay said.  He wrinkled his nose.  "But I still think
they smell like wet sheep."

Noxy bit back an angry retort.  They didn't smell anything *like*
sheep, not really, and if he wasn't smart enough to---

*Twinge.*  "Ouch," she muttered, putting her hand on the back of her
head.  The pain was strong enough this time that she thought there
would be a lump, but she couldn't feel anything.

"Is everything all right?" Thokmay asked, eyeing her.

"Yes, it's fine," she snapped.  She closed her eyes.  She had hoped
the clouds would be right next to the mounting platform so that he
could stroke one.  Or even get on, though she knew what her mother
would say about *that* if she found out.  Like a thousand cloudherds
before her, she wished the clouds would come when she whistled like
the goofs did.

"Um...  Are they supposed to be doing that?"  She opened her eyes at
Thokmay's words to see Big Blue turning toward them.  Below him,
Pillow was rising as quickly as Noxy had ever seen her move.

Thokmay stepped back instinctively as Big Blue bumped against the
mounting platform.  Noxy stroked the old bull's flank.  "See?" she
said.  "You can pull bits of them this way and that, but it all
settles back into a big lump after a while."  She grabbed a handful of
Big Blue's side and pulled as hard as she could.  When she let go, the
bit she had teased out slowly sank back into the cloud.

The young soldier patted the cloud gingerly.  Noxy grinned wickedly.
"Here, do this."  She backed up, then ran at the cloud and threw
herself up onto his back.  *Poof!* "Come on!" she said when Thokmay
hesitated.  "He won't bite."

"Noxious Aftertaste!  What do you think you're doing?"  Noxy's heart
leaped into her throat.  There, at the top of the steps that led down
to the platform, stood her mother and Sergeant Dorbu.  "You get off
that cloud *right now*, young lady!"

Noxy's stomach was churning by the time they reached the fortress
gate.  Her mother hadn't said a word to her on the walk back.  "Thank
you for the tour," Thokmay said politely, putting out his hand.

"You're welcome," Noxy mumbled.  She shook his hand and then waited
for the storm she knew was coming.

"And thank you as well," Sergeant Dorbu told Indy, smiling.  "It was a
pleasure."

"You're welcome," the mayor said.  If she had been anyone but Noxy's
mother, Noxy would have said she was blushing slightly.

As the sergeant walked away with Thokmay beside him, Indy rounded on
her daughter.  "Tell me," she said coldly, "What exactly would you
have done if he'd slipped off the cloud?"

"He wouldn't have slipped off!" Noxy protested.  "It was Big
Blue---he's as safe as---"

"I don't care if it was Big Blue or the mattress on your bed!" Indy
said angrily.  She didn't seem to care that half a dozen people were
listening just a few strides away.  "Do you know what the soldiers are
doing this afternoon?  Do you?  They're settling all their friends who
died before we could get to them.  What do you think they'd say if we
had to tell them there was one more to settle, just because you wanted
to show off?"

"Yes, mayor," Noxy said wretchedly.

"Don't you 'yes, mayor' me.  Now, Eyesie gave us some thimbleberries
for those old boots you'd outgrown.  I want you to get the seeds out
so that I can make a pie for dinner."

"Thimbleberries?" Noxy said in despair.  "That'll take forever!  Rash
and Sensy and I were going to---"

"Well, you should have thought of that, shouldn't you?"  Indy took
Noxy by the shoulders, wondering yet again when her daughter had grown
so tall.  "Daffodil, listen to me.  *Really* listen to me." She combed
her daughter's hair off her forehead with her fingers.  "Half the
village is already muttering about it being time for a new mayor.  How
can I ask them to behave when my own daughter won't? Now, go get
washed up and start on those thimbleberries."

Noxy nodded glumly.  "Yes, *amma*."

She moped home to collect the bucket full of hard red thimbleberries
and a large bowl, then climbed the steps to the top of the Quick
Tower.  She and Sensy had covered a tumbled-down block of stone with a
bit of gray canvas to make a pretend cloud the year before.  Plopping
herself down on it, she started squeezing bitter grain-sized seeds out
of the thimbleberries one by one.  Why did she have to be the one to
show him around?  Why couldn't the stupid soldiers have washed up
somewhere else?  And why did the sun have to be so...so sunny?

When she heard the first shouts from the main square she ignored them,
thinking that it was just children playing jump-sticks or *kabbadi*.
Then she heard Sergeant Dorbu shout, "Hah! Heeeyah!" She tossed
another berry into the bowl and stood up on her stone seat to look.

She was just in time to see Thokmay duck under the sergeant's
out-thrust sword and lunge with his own blade as he straightened up,
shouting "Hah!" in turn.  Every child in the village was gathered
around watching, and not a few of the adults as well.

The sergeant knocked Thokmay's blade away and spun around, slashing
left and right, one, two, three, as if he was fighting an invisible
opponent.  While his back was turned the young soldier stepped forward
and stabbed the sergeant in the ribs.

The sergeant groaned, pinning Thokmay's sword with his arm so that it
was pulled out of the boy's grip as Dorbu turned.  Thokmay only had
time to open his mouth before the sergeant's sword tapped him lightly
in the chest.  To Noxy's disgust, the children started to clap.

"You must keep your grip even after you strike," Kulbinder grumbled.
"No point giving your man one last blow."

"I know," said Thokmay, panting slightly.  "I forgot." The sergeant
handed his sword back to him.  both his blade and the sergeant's were
wrapped in leather so that they wouldn't cut.  They were smaller than
Noxy had imagined: each was only as long as its owner's arm, and no
thicker than a pottery plate.

Thokmay and the sergeant brought their swords up slowly, touched
blades with one another, and started fighting again.  Thokmay lost
quickly this time, but won the third round when the sergeant pretended
to stumble over a loose cobblestone.

They practiced for almost half an hour.  While the children clapped
and cheered, some of the older villagers shook their heads and swapped
disapproving looks.  Still, they kept watching.

By the time the sergeant and his young opponent stopped, they were
both soaked with sweat.  They saluted each other one last time.
"You're getting better every day," Sergeant Dorbu said.  "But we could
both use a wash-up."

Thokmay nodded, still breathing hard.  "Smells like we could both use
one too," he said.  For the first time, Noxy saw him smile.

"Show me, show me!" shouted Little Gas.  He clapped his hands with
excitement.  "I want to play!"

Thokmay's smile froze.  He glanced at the sergeant, who shook his head
almost imperceptibly.  "I'm glad you liked it," the young soldier said
to Little Gas.  His clear voice carried right across the village
square.  "But it's not really a game."

He squatted so that he was no taller than Little Gas.  "But I can show
you something else if you like," he said.  He looked left then right,
as if to make sure no spies or grownups were listening.

"Do you have any spare socks at home?" he asked.  Little Gas nodded.
"Good.  You go and get me three pairs of socks, quick as you can, and
three stones the size of your thumb."

Little Gas bit his lip.  "I only have just one other pair of socks,"
he said.  "They're for when it's winter, so my feet will fit in my
boots."

Thokmay's mouth opened, and closed, and opened again.  "Well," he
said, "Do you think your mother would let you borrow some?  Just for a
little bit?" Little Gas nodded quickly and scurried away.

"Do you want the rest of us to get some socks, too?" Sensy asked
hopefully.  She and Rash had been standing with the younger children,
their chores either done or conveniently forgotten.

"Oh, Sensy!" Noxy said under her breath.

"If you like," Thokmay said, straightening up.  Sensy spun around and
sprinted away.  A handful of other children ran off as well.

Little Gas came puffing back a moment later.  In his hands he had one
pair of green socks, one pair of gray, and one pair with red and white
stripes on them.  "Will these do?" he asked, fishing some stones out
of his pocket.

"They look fine," said Thokmay.  "Now, give me your stones...  Good.
Now, the first thing we do is we roll up the socks like this, with a
stone in the middle, to make a ball.  See? And then the next pair...
And the next...  Now, are you ready?" Little Gas nodded.

Thokmay stepped back, took a deep breath, and threw the balled-up
socks into the air.  His hands darted back and forth like
hummingbirds.  Somehow, he managed to catch each sock ball before it
fell to the ground, and then throw it again in time to catch the next
one.  He caught them overhand, he caught them underhand, he threw two
with his left hand while bouncing the third with his right, and then
he threw them all in the air at once and caught them, one, two, three.

There was a moment of stunned silence.  "That's magic!" Rash said
accusingly.  "You're doing magic!"

"It's not magic," Grappa Gas laughed, looking as delighted as any of
the children.  "It's called 'juggling'! I saw it in Chaghan once,
years ago.  It's just a trick."

"That's right," Thokmay agreed, "It's just a trick.  Here, I'll prove
it.  Sergeant?"

Sergeant Dorbu took the brightly colored sock balls and tossed them in
the air, one, two, three.  He whistled a happy little tune as he
juggled, and even managed to wink at Sensy (who blushed).  By the time
he was finished, Little Gas was laughing and clapping his hands.  "Let
me, let me!" he shrieked.  "I want to!"

"All right, but you have to let me show you how," Thokmay said.  "You
have to start with just two, like this.  Um, Sergeant? Could you show
the older children how it's done? Thank you.  Now, put this one in
this hand, and this one in the other, and..."

Noxy watched Little Gas drop all three pairs of socks, pick them up,
and drop them again.  The little boy laughed.  Seething, she sat back
down on her pretend cloud and glared at the bowl of thimbleberries.
It was going to be a long day...

## Chapter 5: Swimming

Noxy was still on her make-believe cloud an hour later, squeezing
seeds out of thimbleberries so angrily it was amazing the the bucket
didn't take fright and try to run away.  Sensy pretended not to notice
as she plopped herself down beside her friend.  "You should have tried
it!" she burbled.  "I only got them all up a few times, but it was so
much fun! Rash could do it almost right away."

"I'm sure it was wonderful," Noxy grumbled.

Sensy pouted.  "Don't be such a goof."

"I'm not being a goof!  I just think he was showing off.  What did
Rash think about him putting his arms around you like that?" The last
time Noxy had looked at the juggling, Thokmay had been standing right
behind Sensy, reaching around to hold her arms just below the elbows.

Sensy brushed her hair back over her ear and grinned.  "Why should I
care what Rash thinks?" she asked sweetly.  Her grin turned into a
leer.  "Or maybe you're the one who cares?"

"Well, *I* think it was embarrassing," Noxy said primly.  "You were
all following him around like ducklings, just because he knew a stupid
trick."

"Well, at least he didn't make everyone say please nine times, like
you did when I wanted to play with the whirlidoodle Granna Fee got you
for your nameday last year!"

Noxy's mouth fell open.  Sensy had never talked back to her before!

The same thought must have occurred to Sensy.  She looked down at the
bucket by Noxy's feet.  "Wow, you've got a lot done."

"Not enough.  Here." She nudged the bucket with her foot.  "If you
want to gossip, you might as well help."

Sensy brushed her hair back over her ear.  "I wasn't gossiping!  I
just came up to tell you that we're going to teach him how to play
Snakes and Whistles."

"Snakes and Whistles? He must know how to play that!"

"Nuh uh.  We were talking about it while we were juggling, and he said
he'd never even heard of it.  I guess they play different games down
below."

"I guess," Noxy echoed dubiously.  She pursed her lips, then stood up
abruptly.  "Well? What are we waiting for? Let's go show him."

By unspoken agreement, Noxy and Sensy didn't go through the main
square---there was no point drawing anyone's attention to the fact
that Noxy had set her chores aside.  Instead, they picked their way
through the stakes and strings in the village pepper garden, held
their breaths as they snuck past the tannery, and slipped out of the
fortress gate as quietly as shadows.

They reached the clearing where the other children had gathered just
as Rash finished explaining the rules to Thokmay.  "But if you can run
all the way back without getting whistled again, then you're safe," he
said.  "I think that's everything."

"What's out of bounds?" someone asked.

"The heather bush, the ponderosa, the lizard rock, and that pile of
earcones," Rash said, pointing at each landmark in turn.

"Did you tell him about not making two snakes at once?" Noxy asked.

Everyone groaned.  "Oh, we're not going to play like that, are we?"
Sensy pouted.  "It takes forever! Anyway, who's going to be leads?"

"You do one team with Thokmay," Noxy said immediately.  "Rash can be
with me.  Everyone else, pick a side!"

The first game only lasted a few minutes.  Thokmay ran straight for
the middle of the field and was whistled almost at once.  Noxy
whistled Sensy a moment later while she was trying to explain what had
happened.  After that, her team couldn't get more than two or three
children into a snake before being whistled by someone from Noxy's
team.

Then Noxy and her team were the snakes, and the tables were turned.
Thokmay swooped down on people like a hawk on a rabbit.  He whistled
three children in as many breaths, then doubled back and whistled Noxy
before she finished saying, "Hey!"

They played until only Rash and Thokmay were left.  Rash feinted left,
then tried to run right, but Thokmay matched him step for step.  The
other children cheered him on, shouting, "Back up!  Come on, Rash!
Make a hoop!" but he just couldn't find an opening.

Rash feinted left again, hesitated for half a heartbeat as if to go
right, then carried on to the left.  Thokmay stumbled and went down on
one knee.  Rash raced past him, then stopped, walked back, and stuck
out his hand to help him up.  Everybody cheered---everybody except
Noxy.

"Looks like a tie," Rash said, grinning.

"A tie?" Noxy exclaimed.  "There's no such thing as a tie!"

"There is now," Rash replied.  "You're not the only one who gets to
make up rules, you know."

"No, no, she's right," Thokmay panted.  "I'm beaten, fair and square."
He picked up a nearby stick, saluted, and handed it to Rash.

"I'm surrendering," he explained.  "Now you break my sword over your
knee and hand me back the hilt."

Rash snapped the branch, then hesitated.  "Which end is the hilt?"

"It doesn't really matter," Thokmay told him.  Rash gave him the
shorter piece of the stick.  The young soldier accepted it gravely and
tucked it into his belt.  As he did so, Noxy saw him catch Rash's eye
and wink.  Rash winked back, as if sharing a joke.  Noxy could have
punched them both.

"What happens if he doesn't accept your surrender?" Sensy asked.

"He has to," Thokmay assured her.  "Nobody would serve under someone
who didn't."

"Who said anything about serving under you?" Noxy asked petulantly.

"Oh Noxy!" "That's not what he said!" She flushed as the others
rounded on her.

Thokmay looked up at the sun.  "I should get back.  Thank you all for
the game."  He bowed at the village children's answering chorus of
thanks and then walked away, the broken stick still in his hand.
After exchanging glances, Sensy and Rash followed him.  As the rest of
the children followed them, a sinking feeling in the pit of Noxy's
stomach told her that maybe the young soldier actually had won the
game---just not the game she'd thought they were playing.

Indy and Grappa Gas were by the gate when Noxy got back, deep in
conversation with Sergeant Dorbu.  The tiger was there as well,
sitting on his haunches, with Thokmay at his side.  Not for the first
time, Noxy wished there was some other way into Stale that didn't
involve jumping off a low-flying cloud.

"But respected, I promise they'll stay out of everyone's way,"
Sergeant Dorbu was saying.

Indy shook her head.  "Letting you and yours stay here to heal up is
one thing," she said apologetically.  "But if your men start walking
patrols, it'll look an awful lot like we're joining this fight."

"Nothing wrong with that," Grappa Gas muttered, subsiding when Indy
shot him a warning look.

Kulbinder cleared his throat. "May I suggest a compromise?  What if
some of the men were to ride with you when you take the clouds up?
Sure no one could object to you giving them tours?"  He flicked an
ear.  "I'm sure my boy for one would enjoy it."

Ten minutes later Noxy was up in the Quick Tower on her make-believe
cloud, her thimbleberries at her feet and her mother's pointed
reminder still stinging in her ears.  *It's just not fair,* she
thought angrily.  *I have to sit here doing chores, but **he** gets to
go riding.*

She tossed the berries she had picked up back into the bucket and
clambered up to look over the parapet.  Pillow was just leaving the
cloud pen with Grappa Gas and Thokmay on her back.  Noxy could almost
hear Grappa Gas saying, "There's nothing in the world as comfortable
as an old cloud," just like he always did when he took *her* for a
ride.  At least he hadn't brought some maple twists to share with
Thokmay---at least, she *hoped* he hadn't.

*He'll let Pillow rain on the fish pond first,* she thought, *That
way, she won't be fidgety.*

Sure enough, Grappa Gas brought the cloud around in a graceful turn
toward the fishpond.  She didn't need any more instruction than
that. She drifted to a stop, then started to rain contentedly.  The
pair of elders sitting on log benches beside the pond returned Grappa
Gas's wave.

Noxy closed her eyes.  She could practically mind-hear the old cow's
contentment as she slowly began to lighten.  *Why don't you just drop
him in the pond?* she thought despondently.

*Bad,* she imagined Pillow replying.  *Bad hurt.*

*Oh, he'd be all right,* she replied in her head.  *The pond's pretty
deep.  And it'd serve him right for showing off with all his juggling
and his surrendering and stuff.*  She imagined Pillow thinning out
underneath Thokmay little by little.  He wouldn't notice right away,
not on his second-ever flight with Grappa Gas talking a gallop a
breath beside him.

She opened her eyes in shock.  There, a hundred strides below her, she
saw Thokmay sink slightly, then some more. He yelped as he suddenly
realized what was happening.

"Hold on!" Grappa Gas shouted, reaching for him, but it was too
late. Thokmay cried out as he fell through the hole in the cloud
and splashed into the ice-cold fishpond.

His head burst above water a moment later. "Help!" he screamed. "Help
me! I can't---" He thrashed his arms as if he was trying to swim, but
something was pulling him down.

Noxy's hand flew to her mouth. His armor! Thokmay must have put his
armor back on!  She watched in horror as Grappa Gas shouted at the
elders to get help. With two quick steps he reached the edge of the
cloud and jumped.

A moment later he surfaced in the pond, spluttering and shouting,
"I've got you, lad!" The old man wrapped one arm around Thokmay and
began to backstroke toward the edge of the pond with the other.

Noxy pelted down the stairs, shouting that they'd fallen in the pond,
both of them, they were going to freeze!  Like everyone who had grown
up in the mountains, she knew how relentless the cold was.  Even if
Grappa Gas got Thokmay out of the water, it could still---

The tiger surged past her.  "Canaries on me!" he roared.  Stalers
leaped out of his way with startled shouts as he charged across the
square and through the gate.

Grappa Gas and Thokmay had been hauled out of the pond and wrapped in
goofskin coats by the time Noxy got there, but were shivering
uncontrollably.  "How did this happen?" Kulbinder demanded for the
tenth time.  "How could he fall?"

Aft shouldered through the gathering crowd with a pair of round jugs
in his hands.  Handing one to Granna Fee, he twisted the lid off the
other and knelt beside the pond to fill it with water, then screwed
the lid back on.

"You just had to show off, didn't you?" he growled at his father.
Without waiting for a reply, he unscrewed the lid and passed the jug
to his father.  "Drink up."

Grappa Gas pushed the now-steaming water aside weakly.  "G-g-give it
to th-th-the boy," he stuttered.

"I'll take care of the boy," Granna Fee said.  She tipped her jug so
that Thokmay could take a sip.  "There you go.  Nice and slow.
That'll warm you up from the inside."

"Th-th-thank you, resp-p-pected."  Thokmay reached for the jug

Granna Fee shook her head.  "I'll hold onto it for now," she said,
kindly but firmly.  "Ulfmaerr only made the two of them, and if you
knew what this old goof eats, I don't think you'd want to share with
him."

It was another ten minutes before Thokmay and Grappa Gas could stand.
They hobbled up the path toward Stale side by side with a crowd of
villagers and soldiers around them.  As they left the pond, Kulbinder
cut Indy off.  "How could this happen?" His ears were flat against his
head, and his eyes glinted dangerously.  "He could have died!"

"They both could have," the mayor replied steadily.  She matched the
tiger's stare until the big cat blinked and looked away.

"I apologize," he rumbled.  "But that doesn't change my question.  I
thought these clouds were safe."

"They are."  Noxy heard the worry in her mother's voice.  "We've been
riding them forever---Big Blue was Grappa Gas's first ride, and
Pillow's not much younger.  They've never done anything like this."

Standing unnoticed two paces behind her mother, Noxy felt as shaky as
Grappa Gas and Thokmay.  She knew why Pillow had dropped Thokmay in
the pond, but she also knew that it was impossible to mind-speak to a
cloud without touching it.  The only problem was, she had felt herself
do it.

She waited with everyone else by the trading hall until Granna Fee
came out.  "He'll be all right," she reassured her granddaughter.  "We
got the hot water into him before the cold could take root."

"Thanks, *amma*."  Noxy fell into step beside her grandmother.  "Do
you think---I mean, I heard people talking.  Do you think someone
could have made Pillow drop him?"

"What? Who said that?" Granna Fee asked sharply.

"I don't know," Noxy hedged, not meeting her grandmother's eyes.  "I
just---I know Grappa Gas wouldn't have done it, and he was the only
'herd on her, and people can't mind-talk to clouds if they're not on
them---can they?"

Her grandmother stopped abruptly and put her hand on Noxy's arm.  "Why
don't we go have a cup of tea?" she said quietly.  "We can talk then."

Ten minutes later they were sitting at the tiny table in Granna Fee's
two-room house, waiting for the kettle to boil.  "I wish we could have
just used one of the magic jugs," Noxy joked weakly.

Granna Fee smiled.  "Me too.  But it'll take them a couple of days at
least to soak up enough heat to work again."  She spooned some tea
into her chipped brown pot, peered at it, and added another spoonful.
"I asked your father if he could make another one, but he said that
part of him was all used up."

"Did he say what part?" Noxy asked hesitantly.

Her grandmother shook her head.  "I didn't ask.  Here, I'll get that."
She took the whistling kettle off the stove and slowly poured the
steaming water into the teapot.  Setting the kettle on a polished
whorl of ironbark, she winked at Noxy and reached into her knitting
basket to pull out a small jar and opened it.  "Honey?"

"I thought you were out?" Noxy said, taking it.

"Only when Gas comes over.  That man..."  She shook her head in mock
despair.

They sipped their tea and put their cups down in unison, as they had
countless times since Indy had become mayor and Noxy had started
spending more time with her granna than with her mother.  "So what
*do* you think happened?" Noxy asked, hoping Granna Fee couldn't hear
her heart thumping.

The old woman shook her head.  "I don't know.  Your father---" She
stopped herself.  "Do you know how he discovered he could do magic?"

Noxy shrugged.  "*Amma* never said."

Granna Fee settled back in her chair with a wince, warming her hands
with her teacup.  "He was fishing one day---not in a pond like here,
but with a net in the ocean, back where he grew up---and he wished
that he was done for the day.  A heartbeat later the net fell apart in
his hands and..."  She shrugged.  "No net, no fishing.  But when he
got back to land and tried to tie up his boat, he couldn't make a
knot.  Every time he tried, he'd drop the end of the rope or it would
tangle in his fingers or something else would happen.  Something had
heard his wish and taken it as a bargain."

She leaned forward.  "He was lucky.  There was another magician in the
town where he grew up who could teach him how to control it.  But he
still wound up making some bad bargains."

"Like having to live where nobody had ever slept on the sea," Noxy
said.

Granna Fee nodded.  "Like that.  It saved someone from shipwreck, he
said, but he was half-crazy by the time he got here.  Even down in
Duck Droppings there was someone who'd been on a ship once, so he
couldn't stay there more than a couple of nights."

"But what does this have to do with Pillow?" Noxy asked.

Granna Fee shrugged again.  "What if it wasn't Pillow?  What if
someone here can do magic, but doesn't realize it yet?"

Noxy took another sip of tea.  Her mouth suddenly felt dry.  "Who?"

"I don't know," her grandmother admitted.  "It might not even be one
of us.  I heard a couple of the soldiers talking in the trading hall
last night, and some of them are pretty angry at the tiger for not
spotting the ambush that got their friends killed.  Maybe one of
them...  I don't know.  It's all so tangled up, half the king's army
on one side and the rest with the princess.  Who knows how many wound
up on the wrong side?"

They talked about other things after that, normal everyday things like
when it would be time to shear the goofs of their winter wool and how
Sensy only seemed to want to talk about her hair and her clothes and
who they might meet that summer and how many dishes Grappa Gas would
wash for a taste of honey.  It felt warm and comfortable, and was
almost enough to convince Noxy that her grandmother might be
right---that what had happened earlier that day had nothing to do with
her.

"I should go," Noxy finally said, eyeing her empty teacup
regretfully.  "If I don't get those thimbleberries done, *amma* will
shear *me*."

Granna Fee smiled.  "How about you bring them down here and we'll do
them together?"

"Thanks, *amma*, but I said I'd do it."  She stood, then impulsively
stepped around the table to give her grandmother a hug.  "I love you."

"I love you too, daffodil."  They held each other for a moment, one
wondering when the other had gotten so big, the other wondering when
the first had gotten so small, and then Noxy left.

## Chapter 6: The Coming Storm

Afternoon was flirting with evening by the time Aft returned on
Pillow.  "She was huddled up in the canyon above Tinker's Creek," he
told Indy, his face set in an even deeper scowl than usual.  "She was
skittish like I've never seen her.  Managed to spook a whole graze of
wildings, too.  One poke and it'll turn into a stampede."

Indy nodded.  Aft had found her up on the wall, where she had come to
check on Noxy's progress.  The two adults were looking west, where
sheets of cirrus were gathering above the peaks.  "Then let's hope
nothing pokes them," she said after a moment.  "Although the way this
day's gone..."

Noxy kept her eyes on her thimbleberries.  She had learned a long time
ago that if she didn't draw attention to herself, adults would
sometimes forget that she could hear them.  She had learned a lot
about cloudherding and negotiating with traders that way, along with a
few things about her mother's youthful misadventures that she was
definitely not supposed to know.

After a few more details about the wild clouds he'd seen and a barbed
comment about whether there was anything his father wouldn't do to
impress people, Aft nodded a goodbye and left.  "Finish those later,"
Indy told Noxy, her eyes still on the gathering clouds.  "We have
other chores right now."

Stale was no stranger to storms.  When bulls battled each other in the
dead of winter, the snow fell so thick and so fast that people had to
string ropes between the houses to find their way.  And in the summer,
when nimbus clouds that had stayed in the north to give birth flew
south to rejoin their herds, the sky could darken in the time it took
to sing a nursery rhyme.  When that happened, the villagers knew it
was time to tie their shutters closed and get the goofs indoors,
because the rain was going to come down in sheets instead of drops.

"I am from Thind," Kulbinder growled when Indy told him why she wanted
the soldiers to stay in the trading hall.  "I have lived through
monsoons.  This could not possibly be worse."

"Maybe not, but I bet it'll be a lot colder," Sergeant Dorbu said.  He
and his men had spent the afternoon washing the bodies of their fallen
comrades and patching the holes and tears in their uniforms.  Those
who were well enough had scoured the woods for firewood as well,
stacking it to make a pyre just down the hill from the fortress gate.
Indy and Noxy had found him there, helping as best he could while
three of the village elders laid a spiderweb net over the wood so that
it wouldn't blow away.

Kulbinder sniffed.  "Storm or not, someone should be on patrol.  But I
agree, it would be best if the men stayed warm."

"How---how is Thokmay doing?" Noxy asked hesitantly.

The tiger looked at her for a moment before replying.  "He is well,"
he said.  "He is strong, and Respected Gas got to him quickly.  He
will be well."

The sun had almost disappeared behind the mountains when the first
sharp line of lightning sparked the far-off clouds.  Granna Fee said a
word Noxy wasn't supposed to know.  "Let's not dawdle," she said
briskly, pulling another armload of damp laundry off a drying line and
stuffing it in a sack.  Ten strides away, Little Gas was pulling apart
strips of cedar bark so that Sensy could lay them along the irrigation
trenches in the vegetable garden.  Children, grandparents, and
everyone else who could walk hurried to ready the village, stepping
around soldiers or shooing them out of the way as they watched the
sudden flurry of activity with bemusement.

Noxy carried the last sack of laundry upstairs to her bedroom for want
of anywhere else to put it.  Her mother was chopping onions by the
time she got back downstairs.  "Thanks, daffodil," she said, blinking
away a tear.  "Can you do some potatoes?  And see if the cheese is
still fit to eat.  I hope the tiger isn't too picky."

Noxy pulled up short.  "The tiger?"

Indy sniffled.  "Yes, he's coming for dinner.  So is the sergeant.
His boy's still in bed."  She swept a double handful of diced onions
into the cooking pot with the back of the knife and started peeling
what was probably the last knob of ginger in Stale.  "It's the polite
thing to do," she continued without looking as Noxy opened and then
closed her mouth.

"Yes, *amma*."  Noxy set the loosely-woven bag of potatoes on the
potato and began to scrub the skins off them with a piece of
sandstone.  She had almost decided to tell her mother what had really
happened that morning, but that wasn't a discussion she wanted to
start now---not the way her mother got whenever company was coming.

Sergeant Dorbu knocked on their door just as the rain began to fall.
Noxy had been expecting him to be in his uniform, but he had traded in
his helmet for a plain goofskin cap that any cloudherd might have
worn, and had left his sword behind.

Kulbinder padded in behind him while he and Indy were saying their
hellos.  He flowed up onto the chair across from Noxy and watched
impassively as she swept the last scraps of potato off the table.
"He is better," the tiger said abruptly.

Noxy jumped slightly.  "Oh.  You mean Thokmay?  Um, I'm glad to hear
it.  It's pretty dangerous, getting dunked in frozen water like that.
It happened to one of the goofs a couple of years ago.  She got out of
their pen and tried to get across the---um.  It doesn't matter.  But
I'm glad he's all right."  She could feel her cheeks burning under the
tiger's cool stare.

Her cheeks heated up even more when she saw Sergeant Dorbu's grin.
"Don't worry," he said cheerfully.  "He does that to everyone.
Saints, I almost swallowed my fork the first time I met him."

"It was a spoon," Kulbinder corrected.  "And it was more than
'almost'."

And just like that the rhythm of the meal took shape.  Sergeant Dorbu
had a seemingly inexhaustible supply of stories about his foolishness,
clumsiness, or bad choices.  Indy asked just enough questions to keep
the stories coming, while Kulbinder's dry comments provoked protests
of innocence and occaisonal snorts of laughter.  As she table a tray
bearing grilled slabs of cheese, fried onions, and boiled potatoes,
Noxy realized with a start that she was actually enjoying herself.
The mood was only slightly dampened by the tiger sniffing at the
cheese and then saying thank you, but it would probably upset his
digestion, he would hunt in the forest after the storm was over.

Conversation became more serious after the dishes were cleared.  The
Angry Canaries had declared for Princess Shudarga almost as soon as
she raised her banner, and had been fighting ever since.  "Or getting
to a fight, or getting away from one, or trying to get enough food in
our bellies to keep us fighting," Sergeant Dorbu added.  "We were up
north, with the Cut Cards and Colonel Ordshe's mob, right in the
middle of Shudarga's land."

"Is that why you chose her side?" Indy asked as she splashed some dark
mountain *rak* into a glass and passed it to him.  Catching Noxy's
eye, she poured a thimbleworth into another glass and handed it to her
daughter.  The pungent fumes tingled in Noxy's nose as she tasted it
gingerly.

Sergeant Dorbu shook his head.  "Wasn't for that.  My family..."  He
paused, rolling his glass between his hands as if to warm them.  "We
used to have land.  Not much---really just a big farm with a couple of
tenants to work it---but it was enough to keep us.  Then one of our
neighbors decided he wanted it.  She honeyed up the local *tralpa*,
promised him a slice of the takings, and..."  He spread his hands.
"By the time we got to court, she'd rented all the laws that would
have saved us.  We had a week to clear out after living their all our
lives."

"That must have been horrible," Indy said sympathetically.

"It is foolishness," Kulbinder rumbled.  "The law in Thind is not
something to be borrowed for money like a bullock.  There are rules
for each station, and that is that."

"But then how does the king raise money?" Noxy asked.

Kulbinder blinked slowly.  "The emperor takes what he needs when he
needs it.  It is...simpler."

"Simpler *and* fairer," Sergeant Dorbu added with a quiet intensity
that hadn't been there a moment earlier.  "And that's what the
princess wants.  Laws should be there for everyone, all the time, not
just for whoever has the most money on the day of a trial.  And if
that means a bunch of royals have to work for a living instead of
renting out laws some king gave their great-great-grands way back
when, that's fine by me."  He drained his glass in one quick gulp.
When her mother did the same, Noxy held her breath and swallowed the
last of her own *rak*.

The thick black liquid felt like fiery smoke as it went down her
throat.  She clenched her jaw, but a strangled cough managed to
escape.  "And that's enough for *you* tonight," her mother said in
mock-disapproval.

"Yes, *amma*," Noxy said, gasping for air.

"Here."  Her mother pushed the empty kettle across the table.  "How
about you refill that and I'll make tea?  It sounds like the worst of
the storm has passed, and a bit of air will help you clear your head."

Noxy nodded, not trusting herself to speak.  She slipped her feet into
her boots without bothering to do up the laces, pulled a poncho over
her head, and stumbled out into the night.

Rain was still falling, but Indy had been right---most of the panicked
clouds had passed, and the few stragglers chasing them were already
east of Stale, heading toward the plains.  She watched them for a
moment, then closed her eyes.

"Goof," she muttered a moment later.  Of *course* she hadn't been able
to mind-hear anything.  What had happened earlier with Thokmay had
been a coincidence.  She shouldn't---

Something clattered in the narrow gap between her house and the
yarning shed.  Noxy opened her mouth to ask who was there, but stopped
herself.  What if the troll had come back?  There was no reason it
would, but there was no reason it would have been in the village in
the first place.

She set the kettle down quietly on the front step of her house and
tiptoed gingerly toward the gap.  Holding her breath, she leaned
forward and peeked around the corner, just in time to see a shadowy
figure disappear out the other end.  It was definitely a person, not a
troll, but who would be out in the rain?

*The soldiers,* she realized.  It had to be one of the soldiers,
except why would they be out in the rain either?  Suspicious, she
hurried to follow.

"Ow!"  Ten steps in, her foot connected with a pile of cobblestones
that she and Sensy had put there as part of some long-forgotten game.
The stones clattered as they tumbled over.  Cursing under her breath,
she stepped over them, wishing that she had taken a moment earlier to
do up her laces.  Some of the broken cobbles had sharp edges, and if
she lost a boot now, she'd never catch up.

She reached the other end of the gap just in time to see the shadowy
figure disappear around the edge of the tannery.  She hesitated for
only a moment before sprinting after it, her boots splashing in
shallow puddles of rainwater.  Whoever she was chasing was bound to
hear her---the only question was whether she could catch them first.

She rounded the corner of the tanning shed a moment later.  Her quarry
was nowhere to be seen.  "Rot," she cursed.  Left toward the trading
hall, straight on toward the square, or right toward the vegetable
patches and the gate?

*Crack!* She shrieked with surprise as a bolt of lightning split the
sky, then stomped her foot, angry at herself, the rain, and the world
in general.  She'd lost them.  And by the time she got back, her
mother was sure to give her the "what took you so long?" look that she
hated so much.

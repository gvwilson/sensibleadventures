<p align="center"><em>For Madeleine, who is taking me on the greatest journey of my life.</em></p>
<p><em>Consider Cherne. A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight thousand gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to west. Its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to cradle that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well. Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a war that scarred the moon and turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass. When it was over the Pilots were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.</em></p>
<p><em>Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms. it is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot, 1272, and a girl who is no longer a child but not quite yet a woman is crouched on a cloud, chilled to the bone and desperately hoping that they're not too late...</em></p>
<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; Grappa Gas bellowed. &quot;It's going to get bumpy!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy dropped to one knee, pulled the glove off her left hand, and pressed her palm against the cloud beneath her. She could mind-hear Big Blue's determination, but the cloud was old, older even than Grappa Gas, and they were flying straight into a headwind.</p>
<p><em>Faster!</em> she urged. <em>Please, faster!</em> She shivered despite her goofskin hat and coat, her hand already numbed by the icy mountain air.</p>
<p>Beside her, the tiger snarled as the last of the crows that had attacked them swirled overhead. One dove at his head. He reared up and swiped at it with one paw, cursing in Thindi as the black bird snapped its wings open and let the wind throw it sideways just an instant before the tiger's claws would have torn it apart.</p>
<p>Up ahead, a makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose like an island out of the forest. A dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire. Shading her eyes with her right hand, Noxy saw that the soldiers had formed a circle around it. Their kilts and sturdy boots were travel-stained, and their battle masks and lacquered leather armor were scarred from fighting. Some had swords in their hands, while others held spears or bows. Big Blue's mate Pillow floated above them, her sides rippling as she struggled to keep station in the wind, but the soldiers only spared an occasional pleading glance for the two clouds. They were looking at the trees around them, waiting for the forest to attack again.</p>
<p>&quot;You're coming in too low!&quot; Granna Fee yelled. Noxy's grandmother lay full length on Big Blue, propped up on her elbows with a pair of binoculars in her hands. &quot;Level him off!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no time!&quot; Grappa Gas yelled back, his red-and-yellow scarf flapping madly behind him. &quot;We're going to have to bump and scrape!&quot; The old man closed his eyes. His lips moved as he mind-spoke commands to the cloud beneath him. Noxy mind-heard the old bull protest, but even as he grumbled he bunched up and went into a steep dive.</p>
<p>Noxy had just a moment to think, <em>I'd be grounded for a <strong>month</strong> if I even <strong>thought</strong> about doing something like this,</em> and then the cloud thudded against the side of the peak like a sack full of wet wool. Nox yelped and sprawled forward to land in an untidy heap beside Granna Fee. &quot;Sorry!&quot; she said, but her grandmother was already up, swaying to keep her balance as the cloud scraped across bare rock, flattened two tents, and came to a halt.</p>
<p>The tiger bounded off with a roar. &quot;What are you waiting for!?&quot; Granna Fee shouted at the soldiers, sliding down Big Blue's flank and waving her arm as if to sweep them all onto the cloud. &quot;Get on! Get on!&quot;</p>
<p>As Noxy scrambled to her feet, Grappa Gas caught her arm. &quot;I'll help 'em up. You stay here and keep Blue together.&quot; Without waiting for her to answer he stumped forward, his peg leg leaving dimples in the cloud. &quot;And keep an eye out for squirrels!&quot; he added over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced back just in time to see something big and brown swing between two trees below them. Another hairy shape followed it, then another, and suddenly the trees were full of them, hooting and shaking the branches.</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa! Grappa, there's trolls!&quot; she shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;I see 'em!&quot; the old man shouted back.</p>
<p>&quot;And a bear!&quot; Noxy added as a brown bear charged out of the trees and reared up on its hind legs with a roar. The muscles under its thick fur bunched as it dropped back to all fours to charge forward a few steps, halt, and roar again.</p>
<p>&quot;'Course there's a bear,&quot; Grappa Gas grunted as he clasped hands with the nearest soldier and helped him scramble up onto the cloud. A second soldier tossed his spear aside and pulled himself up beside the first. Together, they reached back and hauled up a third man while Grappa Gas reached for a fourth.</p>
<p>But instead of grabbing the cloudherd's hand, the man on the ground lifted a heavy canvas-wrapped bundle. &quot;Never mind that, get yourself up here!&quot; Grappa Gas ordered.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not leaving them!&quot; the man on the ground yelled back. One of the soldiers already on the cloud shouldered Grappa Gas aside, grabbed a corner of the canvas, and tried to drag it onto the cloud. His legs sank halfway to his knees with the weight.</p>
<p>Noxy felt Big Blue shudder underneath her. She dropped to her knees and pressed her hand against the cloud once again. <em>Just a little longer,</em> she pleaded, trying to squelch her fear so that he couldn't mind-hear it. <em>Stay bunched up just a little longer.</em> She pictured the cloud pulling itself into a dense blob. Obediently the cloud began to contract.</p>
<p>Even as it did so, Noxy heard a shrill warning whistle from her friends on board Pillow high above them. Cold fear jellied in her gut as the trolls suddenly stopped hooting.</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa---&quot; she started to say.</p>
<p>&quot;Just keep him together!&quot; Grappa Gas snapped. Cursing, he yanked another soldier up onto the cloud. This one was just a boy, Noxy realized, no older than she was with a frightened, determined look on his scarred face. He took two steps before his feet slipped out from underneath him and sent him sprawling beside one of the half-dozen canvas-wrapped bundles that lay together in a pile.</p>
<p>The tiger scrambled up the cloud behind him. Noxy mind-heard Big Blue's protest as the great cat's claws tore wisps off his flank. <em>Just a little longer,</em> she begged. <em>Please, just a little longer.</em></p>
<p>She glanced at the forest. A brown wave spilled back and forth around the bases of the trees. Above it, the trolls began hooting again. &quot;Now now now!&quot; the Gifted ones shouted, the will of the forest surging through their minds like a raging flood. &quot;Get them get them get them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Spread yourselves out, you numbskulls!&quot; Grappa Gas thundered at the soldiers struggling not to sink into the cloud. &quot;Spread-eagle if you have to. Come on, Fee, we gotta fly!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's grandmother clambered up Big Blue's flank with a speed born from decades of practice. &quot;Now or never!&quot; she yelled at the soldier who had been lifting up the bundles. He grabbed a handful of cloud just as a swarm of squirrels burst out of the forest and surged up the rocky slope, thousands of them leaping from stone to stone, their tiny eyes fixed on the intruders and just one thought in their minds.</p>
<p><em>Up!</em> Noxy mind-yelled at Big Blue. The cloud heaved himself into the air. As the soldiers shouted and toppled over she heard Grappa Gas shout, &quot;Hold on!&quot;</p>
<p>The last soldier clung desperately to Big Blue as the cloud's flank squished between his fingers like soggy dough. The oncoming squirrels jumped at his legs. One managed to catch hold of his boot. It scrambled up the laces and sank its teeth into his calf. The soldier cursed and kicked it off. With a last desperate lunge he managed to catch hold of Grappa Gas's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;You idiot!&quot; Grappa Gas yelled as he pulled the soldier up onto Big Blue's back. &quot;You saints-be-damned <em>idiot</em>! They woulda peeled you like an apple! What was so weeping important that you couldn't just leave it?&quot; He kicked one of the bundles at his feet. &quot;Eh? What was so---urp!&quot;</p>
<p>In one smooth motion the soldier had rolled onto his feet and grabbed a handful of Grappa Gas's collar. &quot;With respect, honored, I'm grateful for the rescue,&quot; he panted, &quot;But that's one of my men you're kicking, and I'll be thanking you to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>He let go of Grappa Gas's coat. The cloudherd coughed. &quot;Ah. Sorry, lad. I didn't realize.&quot; He looked down at the bodies lying at his feet. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier nodded. &quot;Me too.&quot; He stared back at the pinnacle of rock, where the squirrels had already torn the tents to pieces. &quot;Me too.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Earlier that day...</em></p>
<p>Noxy and Sensy volunteered to collect spiderwebs that morning---or rather, Noxy volunteered them both and Sensy went along with it like she always did. Winter had finally turned to spring; stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the shadows of the twisted mountain pines, but the sun shone diamond-bright in a clear blue sky, and carding camel wool indoors suddenly seemed unbearable. Besides, getting out of the village would give them a chance for a talk that Noxy thought was long overdue.</p>
<p>&quot;Shoo.&quot; She poked a fat brown spider with a stick. It waved its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a new home. Noxy cut its web's anchor threads with two practiced twists of her knife and began winding it onto a stick.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?&quot; Sensy asked.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced at her. &quot;Why? Are those ones coming loose?&quot; She had been trying for an hour to think of a way to broach the subject of their mutual friend Rash, who was the only boy their age in the village of Stale.</p>
<p>&quot;No, they're just kind of plain.&quot; Sensy looked down at her soft brown goofskin coat critically. &quot;Granna Fee has some really nice red ones. She said she'd give them to me if I picked the stones out of her pepper garden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her whole garden? That would take forever.&quot; Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder. &quot;Why would you do all that work for buttons you don't need?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you're no help,&quot; Sensy pouted. She had spent the winter embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar. All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes, and her hair, and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer. The only thing she <em>didn't</em> want to talk about was Rash.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes,&quot; Granna Fee had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who seemed to have taken her best friend's place.</p>
<p>&quot;Not me!&quot; Noxy had declared.</p>
<p>Her grandmother had laughed. &quot;No, sweetling, not you.&quot;</p>
<p>The three children had grown up together, done chores together, played tag and make-believe in the forest around Stale together, and learned to mind-speak with clouds together, but something had changed that winter. Sometimes Noxy saw Sensy look at Rash, or Rash look at Sensy, and then look away as if they felt guilty or were afraid they might blurt out a secret. Other times they just sat there not speaking. If her two best friends were mad at one another, Noxy thought it was her job go sort it out.</p>
<p>Noxy slung her bag over her shoulder. &quot;Come on, let's go look for some more.&quot; She set off without waiting for an answer. A moment later Sensy scrambled to catch up with her.</p>
<p>The path was one of dozens that snaked through the evergreen forest surrounding Stale. Mud made it slippery where it wasn't slick with ice, but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the ridge above her home.</p>
<p>Below her lay the ancient walls of the fortress that held the village of Stale. The centuries had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as the mountains themselves. The villagers' two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the fortress like ducklings in a nest. Thin licks of smoke rose from their slate chimneys, while goof pens, vegetable plots, and racks laden with drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.</p>
<p>To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge. A net woven from spider thread stretched over its top, as light as a dream but as strong as steel. Another net hung down at the gorge's mouth to make a gate. Inside, just visible from the ridge, two gray clouds floated half-asleep.</p>
<p>Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds, riding them, and, most importantly, practicing mind-speech with them. Grownups called Big Blue and Pillow slow and lazy, but they and the herd of half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance were the most exciting things in Noxy's world.</p>
<p>As Noxy pulled her bag off her shoulder, Sensy grabbed her arm. &quot;Look!&quot; she hissed, pointing into the trees.</p>
<p>At first all Noxy saw was branches. Then a pair of dark eyes blinked, and her mouth went dry. Black fur framed a round face with heavy brows and a gray muzzle. The troll blinked again and pulled a branch aside with one long, hairy arm.</p>
<p>Noxy and Sensy took a step back, then another. A sudden rustling behind them made them freeze. With her breath caught in her throat, Noxy looked over her shoulder. A second troll hung by one hand from a branch behind them, blocking their escape.</p>
<p>&quot;Wh-what are they doing here?&quot; Sensy whispered loudly.</p>
<p>&quot;Ssh!&quot; Noxy said. &quot;Just... don't... move.&quot;</p>
<p>Branches rustled overhead. Two--- three--- four trolls swung by, except no, the fourth didn't swing by. It stopped and looked down at them. Its fur was shot through with gray, and even from five strides below it Noxy could see the long red scar that ran up the length of its left leg.</p>
<p>Something twinged in the back of her head like the start of a headache. She felt dizzy, and for a moment it was as if <em>she</em> was in the tree looking down at herself.</p>
<p>A sudden roar broke the moment. The troll hooted and vanished into the forest. Noxy and Sensy each let out a long shaky breath---</p>
<p>---and screamed as a tiger burst out of the trees half a dozen strides in front of them. His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes, not orange and black like the picture in the book that three generations of village children had passed around. A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear, and his tail twitched slightly as he looked at them, as if their presence reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you all right?&quot; he rumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;Wh-what?&quot; Noxy stammered.</p>
<p>&quot;Are... you... all... right?&quot; the tiger repeated impatiently. &quot;Did those blasted chimpanzees harm you at all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, they---I mean, we're all right. We're fine, thank you very much. Ouch, Sensy, you're going to break my fingers!&quot; Noxy pulled her hand free from her friend's terrified grip.</p>
<p>&quot;Pilots be praised,&quot; he rumbled, settling onto his haunches. &quot;Now, if I may ask a favor, I am looking for the village of Stale Leftovers. Would you be so kind as to direct me?&quot; His ear twitched at the sound of a distant hoot. &quot;Or if perchance you are going that way yourselves, I would be honored to accompany you. Those creatures are unlikely to try another attack if you have a protector.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy hitched her bag up on her shoulder. &quot;They didn't attack us. We---I mean, the village has an arrangement. With the trolls. We don't go too far into the forest, and they don't come near the village except for when they want to trade, and they leave some stones down by the fish pond to tell us when they want to do that, and---&quot; She stopped herself and took a deep breath. &quot;I'm sorry. Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am Kulbinder of Thind,&quot; the tiger said, rising to all fours. &quot;And if you will forgive my impatience, my need is rather pressing. My companions are in danger, and in dire need of rescue. It may already be too late---I need to reach Stale Leftovers <em>now</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shot a look at Sensy. Her friend shook her head slightly and mouthed &quot;no&quot;. That was enough to make up Noxy's mind.</p>
<p>&quot;It's this way,&quot; she said, pointing down the path. &quot;Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>It only took them a few minutes to reach the gap in the fortress wall where an enormous stone door had once hung. A few chunks of its shattered remains lay half-buried in the ground, too big for even a team of sturdy mountain camels to pull free. The wooden gate that Stale's human inhabitants had put up to fill the gap was three planks thick, but still looked like a child's toy set into the Pilots' ancient work.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas was sitting on one of the stones whittling a new leg when they came out of the trees. He raised a hand in hello, then swore and clambered to his feet at the sight of the tiger. &quot;Saints and their creations!&quot; He pointed accusingly with his whittling knife. &quot;What in the underhells is this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>This</em> is a who, not a what,&quot; Kulbinder replied curtly, his tail bristling.</p>
<p>&quot;We met him up by the spider grove,&quot; Noxy said hurriedly. &quot;There were some trolls, and he scared them off. He says---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trolls?&quot; Grappa Gas interrupted incredulously. &quot;Can't be. They haven't come down this far in---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa!&quot; Noxy stomped her foot. &quot;Never mind that now! The tiger says people are hurt and need help. At least, I think they're people,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;They are as human as you are,&quot; the tiger said. &quot;Are you the <em>tralpa</em> here, or the reeve?&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas snorted. &quot;Not likely, but I can take you to them.&quot;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the whole village was in the cobbled square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who had left a week ago for the snowfields to collect Stale's clouds from their winter pasture. Three hundred people, from babies in their parents' arms to those babies' grandparents, stood in a half-circle around the impatient tiger. Some still wore the thick coats and pants they used in winter and when cloudherding. Others, like Noxy and Sensy, had switched to lighter gear that would still seem heavy to anyone unfamiliar with the icy winds of the high mountains. Grappa Gas's son Aft, who had been splitting logs with an ax to make shingles, was the only one in shirtsleeves, but he wasn't the only one scowling at the new arrival.</p>
<p>Noxy's mother Indy thumped the speaker's drum three times and stepped up onto the squared-off stone that marked the center of the square. &quot;Friends,&quot; she said loudly, patting the air with her hands to quiet everyone. &quot;Friends, please. Thank you all for coming. I know it is early in the year for travellers, but please, give a true mountain welcome to Kulbinder, a Gifted of Thind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome... welcome... be welcome...&quot; Some voices were hearty, some grudging, and some people didn't speak at all, but Noxy's mother took it all in stride, just as she always did.</p>
<p>Someone nudged Noxy's shoulder with their own. &quot;Hey,&quot; Rash said, slipping between her and Sensy. &quot;Where's the <em>tralpa</em>? Is he too afraid of the tiger to come out and say hello? Or has he been up all night 'studying' again?&quot; He mimed someone drinking from a bottle.</p>
<p>&quot;Ssh!&quot; But he was right---the king's representative was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Indy thumped the brightly-painted speaker's drum again. &quot;The Gifted has told me that he and his companions were trying to get through the pass to Chaghan. An avalanche forced them off the road and into the forest.&quot; She swept her gaze across the assembled villagers. &quot;The forest got angry. Some of them have died, and the rest are trapped. They need our help.&quot;</p>
<p>A murmur ran through the crowd. The Herd of Trees that blanketed the Brumoso Mountains wasn't mad like the Jungle of Thind, but it guarded its territory and privileges as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs. Gifted creatures who lived among the trees all did its biding. People who stayed near the Pilots' ancient roads never came to harm, and those who ventured deeper were safe as long as they were careful. Make a fire too large, though, or wander into one of the circles of towering redwoods that Granna Fee cautioned Noxy and her friends to steer clear of on training flights, and the forest's wrath would be as merciless as a winter storm.</p>
<p>Aft clapped his hands twice, but didn't wait for Indy to call on him. &quot;Are they smugglers?&quot; he asked loudly.</p>
<p>Noxy saw rather than heard her mother's exasperated sigh. &quot;Not that the Gifted has said, no.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why in the saints' names were they trying to get through the pass this time of year? It'll be another month at least before the high trails clear.&quot; He crossed his brawny arms. &quot;Doesn't seem like something honest folk would do, is all I'm saying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My companions are not 'honest folk',&quot; the tiger said loudly. &quot;They are soldiers.&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd murmured again. &quot;Oh, now that's weeping marvelous,&quot; Aft said sarcastically. &quot;Mind telling us whose side you're on?&quot;</p>
<p>At that, the tiger finally looked at him. &quot;They have the privilege of serving the Learned Shudarga.&quot;</p>
<p>That brought gasps instead of murmurs. As a brilliant young scholar, Shudarga had written pamphlet after pamphlet arguing that Gandan's laws should be free for all to use. The kingdom's merchant-nobles had ignored her at first, or made jokes about her, but when she started organizing peasants and tradesmen, their laughter turned to anger. Arrested, she had escaped the previous summer and raised her flag in rebellion, attracting thousands to her cause, but then winter had come and news from the lowlands had slowed to a trickle, leaving the cloudherds with nothing but rumors.</p>
<p>&quot;Does that mean King Denpa's boys are going to come looking for you?&quot; Grappa Gas demanded, ignoring Indy's insistent clapping for order. &quot;Because if they do, these walls won't keep 'em out for long.&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger's tail twitched. &quot;I did not come to your village for its walls, honored. My companions need help, and you are their only hope. If you are afraid it will bring more trouble than you can chew, say so and I will be on my way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is saying we won't help,&quot; Indy said firmly. &quot;And as long as I'm reeve, nobody is <em>going</em> to say that.&quot; She shot a warning glare at Grappa Gas as he opened his mouth, and a second at Aft to silence him as well. &quot;We can argue about the politics later. Right now, there's folk in trouble, and I won't have it said that the people of this village ever turned their backs on those that needed help.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Clap clap.</em> Granna Fee waited for Indy to nod at her before speaking. &quot;What about the <em>tralpa</em>? I expect he's going to have something to say about us helping rebels.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy's smile was as cold as the distant peaks. &quot;I'll ask him when he wakes up.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>The next five minutes were chaos. Out of the question, Grappa Gas said, whacking his wooden leg with his cane to emphasize his points. The law might forgive them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who wandered in out of a storm, even if they were rebels, but flying off to rescue their friends?</p>
<p>And what would other cloudherds say if they heard that Stale had left people in the forest to die, Aft shot back. Pilots and saints, what would their own kin say when they got back from up the mountain?</p>
<p>The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones. Little whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart as people overheard neighbors they disagreed with, or turned around to agree with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet another &quot;what if?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is going to go on forever,&quot; Noxy said sourly. &quot;They all know they're going to do whatever my <em>amma</em> want to do in the end---why don't they just get on with it?&quot; She, Sensy, and Rash stayed together in a knot on the sidelines, old enough that they hadn't grown bored and run off to play like the younger children, but young enough that the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.</p>
<p>Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a mustache. It had become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had told him countless times he ought to break before <em>someone</em> broke his stupid finger. &quot;What I want to know is whether we're going to get to go, or if we're going to be stuck here with the littles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we'll get to go!&quot; Noxy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Rash raised an eyebrow, another annoying habit he had cultivated over the winter.</p>
<p>Noxy puffed an annoyed breath, biting off her &quot;of course I'm sure!&quot; when she caught Sensy's uncertain look. &quot;Wait here,&quot; she said with a scowl.</p>
<p>She strode through the crowd to the speaker's stone and caught her mother's eye. Before Noxy could speak, Indy said, &quot;Oh, and I think you've met my daughter, Probably Noxious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The honor was mine,&quot; the tiger rumbled, flicking an ear in what might have been the feline equivalent of a very small bow.</p>
<p>Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was immediately annoyed at herself. Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a silly lowlander custom. &quot;Just call me Noxy,&quot; she told him. &quot;<em>Amma</em>, which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on? We can go and start getting them ready while everyone's still jawing.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well. &quot;Who said anything about you three going?&quot;</p>
<p>But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and had assembled her arguments as she crossed the square. They were definitely old enough---why, they were all going to be riding <em>real</em> clouds in a few weeks, not just tame old pair floating about in the cloud pen. And they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down the pass, and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do rescues, wasn't it? And---</p>
<p>&quot;Stop.&quot; Her mother held up a hand, not noticing or just ignoring the looks on the faces of the villagers who had overheard Noxy's torrent of words. &quot;You can go. But!&quot; she continued, &quot;But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna Fee, and that's all you do---ride. Understood?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded obediently. &quot;Yes, <em>amma</em>.&quot; She had learned long ago not to keep asking for a whole orange when she'd already talked her mother into a half.</p>
<p>Somehow everyone eventually realized that they agreed with Indy's decision or that they were so outnumbered as to make further argument pointless. After that, it only took them a few minutes to gather what they needed. Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and they had lifted more than one tinker or trader out of a difficult spot. Coils of hemp rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen, and everyone kept a warm goofskin cap and some heavy gloves handy just in case.</p>
<p>&quot;You look ridiculous,&quot; Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the wooden steps to the mounting platform. He had stitched what he claimed were eagle's wings onto the side flaps of his cap.</p>
<p>Rash looked her up and down. &quot;Really? Because I think you look amazing. Excuse me.&quot; He winked at Noxy and stepped around the speechless pair of thirteen-year-olds.</p>
<p>&quot;Was he---was he <em>flirting</em> with you?&quot; Noxy demanded.</p>
<p>Sensy rolled her eyes. &quot;I really hope not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ears all!&quot; Aft called out two minutes later. He had changed into heavy pants and a padded coat and a pair of soft boots, and his hair was pulled back in a thick club braid with a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven into it for luck. &quot;You know how this is done. I'll lead on Pillow with the younglings as spotters and the Gifted as a guide.&quot; He stabbed his finger at Rash and Sensy. &quot;Gas and Fee, you've got Blue---you take Noxy with you. In and out, quick and simple, and everyone's back here for soup before you can sneeze. No adventures, right?&quot; He glared at Noxy, Sensy, and Rash until the three teenagers mumbled, &quot;No adventures.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; He walked to the end of the plank that jutted out from the platform and whistled through his fingers. When nothing happened, he muttered something about &quot;soggy&quot; and &quot;lazy&quot; and whistled again more loudly.</p>
<p>A hundred strides away and fifty strides below them, a foggy-edged blue-gray mass rippled and began to pull itself into something dense enough to hold the weight of a person. The second, smaller blob next to it followed suit. Side by side, Big Blue and Pillow drifted toward the villagers and the lone tiger waiting at the edge of the ravine. A clanking noise further along the ravine signalled that whoever Indy had sent to pull back the pen's spiderweb gate was pedalling hard to pull it aside.</p>
<p>Big Blue scraped against the ravine wall. Aft glanced over his shoulder, then took three steps and dove off the end of the plank.</p>
<p>Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath. One, two, three... Big Blue dimpled as the burly cloudherd tucked, flipped over, spread-eagled, and hit him dead center. Gray waves rippled out across the cloud's back as Aft rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly. Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount.</p>
<p>&quot;Show off,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered beside her.</p>
<p>Granna Fee elbowed him. &quot;Gets it from his old man.&quot;</p>
<p>Something twinged in the back of Noxy's head. She blinked. &quot;Did you say something?&quot; she asked Sensy.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind.&quot; Noxy shook her head. &quot;Look, he's coming up.&quot;</p>
<p>Big Blue rose toward the platform, bunching into an evern firmer mass as he came. Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the cloud's back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it. A silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, cawing its displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away.</p>
<p>Aft looked up and smiled the smile he only ever wore when he was on cloudback or had his infant daughter in his arms. With a whoop he ran across across Big Blue's back and launched himself into the air again.</p>
<p>Rash whistled. &quot;Nice leap,&quot; he said appreciatively as Aft landed right in the middle of Pillow. &quot;And blind, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not such a trick,&quot; Noxy said dismissively, though she was secretly impressed. &quot;He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, but would you trust a cloud's directions that much?&quot; Rash challenged her. &quot;Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out of what they say.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. She had realized early in their training that mind-speech was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash, or even for some of the olders who were already riding. She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing off. The only person she shared her progress with now was her grandmother, and she didn't even tell Granna Fee everything.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas made everyone wait until Pillow was only a couple of strides below the mounting platform before he let Sensy and Rash jump. The teenagers had been doing it since they were little children, but the brief moment of flight and <em>poof!</em> as they landed still made them all whoop.</p>
<p>&quot;Your turn,&quot; Grappa Gas said to Kulbinder.</p>
<p>The tiger's ears lay flat against his skull, and his tail whipped from side to side. Noxy was sure he was going to refuse, but with a sudden burst of speed he charged to the end of the plank and flung himself into the air. Grappa Gas, Granna Fee, and Noxy leaned over the railing.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh,&quot; Grappa Gas said. &quot;I guess they really do always land on their feet.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em> Noxy winced and put her hand on the back of her head. There it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?</p>
<p>Granna Fee noticed her expression. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Noxy lied. One of the grownups' many rules about cloudherding was that people shouldn't fly if they were sick, but she wasn't going to admit anything that might mean being left behind. &quot;Come on, let's go.&quot;</p>
<p>Aft steered the cow out of the way so that Big Blue could take her place beneath the plank. Grappa Gas landed on him with a soft <em>thud</em>. Granna Fee jumped a moment later, and Noxy a moment after that. &quot;Oof,&quot; Granna Fee grunted, rolling over and sitting up. &quot;That's not as soft as it used to be.&quot; But then she smiled like the girl she had once been and put her arm around Noxy so that her granddaughter could lean against her the way she had so many times before.</p>
<p>Granna Fee pressed her hand against Big Blue and closed her eyes. The cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the mouth of the gorge.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll take lead,&quot; Aft called through cupped hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you said,&quot; Granna Fee muttered under her breath. She slowed Big Blue so that Pillow could pass. As she did so, Aft took the ox horn from his belt and blew three loud notes, low high low. Indy blew an answering note as the two clouds passed through the gate and into the wide expanse of the pass.</p>
<p>Cloudherding is cold work, even in the summer. In the spring, in the mountains, when breath still fogs and the wind pokes its fingers through every loose seam and down every collar, it's beyond freezing. A hundred heartbeats after they left the cloud pen, Granna Fee had wrapped a fleece around herself and her granddaughter, leaving only their faces exposed. Up ahead, Noxy saw that Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy said, he might be a goof, but at least he was a <em>warm</em> goof.</p>
<p>Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected. &quot;Saints and their inventions, but I miss this,&quot; he sighed. He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden leg on so that it wouldn't poke into Big Blue, but a long scarf was his only concession to the freezing temperature. &quot;Look, the condors are back in their nest! We should invite them them to visit some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're not really the most sociable of creatures,&quot; Granna Fee said dryly.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas harrumphed. &quot;You just have to get to know them. I wonder if any of their chicks will be Gifted this year? That would be a thing, wouldn't it? Oh, and down there, is that---saints, is that a person down there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; Noxy pushed the heavy fleece aside and scrambled to the cloud's leading edge. &quot;I don't see, where?&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas shook his head. &quot;Sorry, girl, it was just a troll.&quot; He patted her shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone needs to remember to wear his glasses when he's out and about,&quot; Granna Fee sniffed pointedly. Grappa Gas harrumphed again, but didn't reply.</p>
<p>It had taken the tiger a day to hike up the pass to Stale Leftovers. The cloudherds covered the same distance in less than half an hour, even with the headwind. &quot;There,&quot; Granna Fee said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas frowned, then looked at Kulbinder. &quot;I thought you said there were just a few of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are fewer than we started with,&quot; he growled. He had spent most of the flight crouched down to get out of the wind, his legs and tail tucked underneath his body. Now he stood, arched his back, and padded forward to join Granna Fee at Big Blue's leading edge.</p>
<p>The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose like an island out of the forest. A dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire. Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw a handful of men moving about, some propped against one another to stay upright.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas gave a low whistle. &quot;The <em>tralpa</em> isn't going to like this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither is my daughter,&quot; Granna Fee replied.</p>
<p>One of the soldiers spotted the clouds a moment later. The cloudherds were too far away to hear his shouts, but there was no mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms, or the way his companions rousted their weakened and injured comrades.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep your eyes wide,&quot; Grappa Gas ordered Noxy curtly. &quot;Forest might be happy to let us take them, or it might not.&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't. Without warning a hundred angry voices cawed behind them, and suddenly they were in the midst of a flock of gray-shouldered mountain crows, each one an angry feathered missle with sharp claws and a pecking beak. Noxy screamed as one grabbed her hair and another took hold of her collar and pecked her shoulder. She screamed again, swatting at them as Granna Fee and Grappa Gas yelled and did the same. She could <em>feel</em> their anger coursing through her own veins.</p>
<p>The tiger's roar sent the birds wheeling into the air above them and hurtling away. Noxy slapped at her hair one last time, not quite believing that the attack was over.</p>
<p>A faint shout from up ahead told her that it wasn't. Aft spun the end of a coil of rope over his head to keep them at bay while Sensy and Rash batted at any bird that came too close.</p>
<p>The birds swirled around them for a dozen heartbeats before veering away. Aft handed the rope to Rash and knelt to press his hands against Pillow. A moment later he looked up and shook his head grimly. The cow was too frightened to land when the forest was this angry. If anyone was going to rescue the soldiers, it would have to be the foursome on Big Blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; Grappa Gas bellowed. &quot;It's going to get bumpy!&quot;</p>

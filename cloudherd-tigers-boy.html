<h2 id="prolog">Prolog</h2>
<p><em>Consider Cherne. A diamond adrift in the heavens, its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.</em></p>
<p><em>Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well. Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a century-long Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass, and littered the land with strange magic. When it was over the Pilots were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.</em></p>
<p><em>Now look there, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless squabbles of the Ninety-Nine Kingdoms. A girl is doing her chores. No longer a child but not yet an adult, she has no idea that her world is about to change forever...</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale. Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked between the twisted mountain pines.</p>
<p>&quot;Shoo.&quot; She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick. It waved its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away. Noxy cut the anchor threads of its with two practiced twists of her knife and began winding it onto a stick.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?&quot; Sensy asked, pulling a branch aside to see if another web lay beneath it.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced at her. &quot;Why? Are those ones coming loose?&quot;</p>
<p>Sensy looked down at her soft brown yakskin coat critically. &quot;No. They're just kind of plain.&quot; She sighed wistfully. &quot;Granna Fee has some really nice red ones. She said she'd give them to me if I weeded her pepper garden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her whole garden?&quot; Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder. &quot;That's a lot of work for some buttons you don't really need.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you're no help,&quot; Sensy pouted. She had spent the winter embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar. All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes and her hair and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale. Especially Rash---practically <em>anyone</em> would be more fun to be around than Rash.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes,&quot; Granna Fee had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who seemed to have taken her best friend's place.</p>
<p>&quot;Not me!&quot; Noxy had declared.</p>
<p>Granna Fee had laughed and ruffled her granddaughter's hair. &quot;No, daffodil, not you.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted, &quot;Soldiers! Soldiers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, great,&quot; she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy. The whole point of going out to collect spiderwebs that morning had been to get <em>away</em> from the younger children for a few hours.</p>
<p>Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked himself up and ran to the two girls. &quot;There's soldiers in the village!&quot; he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve. &quot;And they've been fighting! And there's a <em>tiger</em> with them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away. &quot;And there's a dragon under your bed.&quot; The pass below Stale were still blanketed in snow. Avalanches happened almost every day---someone would have to be foolish <em>and</em> desperate to be on the road this early in the spring.</p>
<p>&quot;But there <em>are</em>!&quot; Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to another with excitement. &quot;They've got swords, and some of them are bleeding! And the tiger can <em>talk</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth to say, &quot;Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?&quot; but a deep <em>doom doom</em> cut her off. She and Sensy looked at each other wide-eyed. <em>Doom doom</em>, pause. <em>Doom doom</em>, pause. It was Stale's home drum. It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed help to find their way home. It meant trouble.</p>
<p>Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch. &quot;Come on!&quot; she told Sensy, setting off at a run.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you!&quot; Young Gas shouted behind them. &quot;I told you there was---hey, wait for me!&quot;</p>
<p>Patches of ice made the path slippery underfoot, but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the ridge overlooking the village. There, in a clearing left by a long-ago lighting strike, she paused to catch her breath.</p>
<p>The ancient walls of the fortress of Stale lay below her. Rain and snow had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as the mountains themselves.</p>
<p>The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the walls like ducklings in a nest. Thin wisps of smoke rose from their slate chimneys, while vegetable plots and racks of drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.</p>
<p>To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge. A net woven from squirrel spiders' webs was stretched over its top, as light as a dream but as strong as steel. Another net hung down at the gorge's mouth to make a gate. Inside, just visible from the ridge, two gray clouds drifted half-asleep.</p>
<p>Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds, riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them. Grownups called the pair slow and lazy, but they were the most exciting things in Noxy's world---except, of course, for the herd of half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance.</p>
<p>Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her hand. &quot;Wait!&quot; she hissed, pointing into the trees. For a moment all Noxy saw was branches. Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and suddenly she could make out a hairy form in the trees.</p>
<p>Noxy's mouth went dry. She felt Sensy squeezed her hand, and squeezed back. As long as they didn't startle it...</p>
<p>Little Gas burst out of the bushes behind them and ran headlong into Noxy. &quot;Oof!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;What are you---mmph!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Noxy whispered urgently, her hand clamped over his mouth. &quot;Don't... move...&quot;</p>
<p>Before Young Gas could protest, the troll stepped into the clearing. His fur was silvered with age, and his eyes seemed as old as the mountains themselves. He and Noxy stared at each other for one long moment before he leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up into the tree. After one last look, he disappeared into the greenery.</p>
<p>Sensy was the first to speak. &quot;Wh-what's a troll doing <em>here</em>?&quot; she asked shakily, still holding Noxy's hand.</p>
<p>Noxy shook her head. &quot;Worry about that later. Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>The drum had stopped booming by the time the children reached the fortress wall. An enormous stone door stood half-open at the entrance, its iron hinges melted in some long-ago battle. The wooden gate that Stale's current human inhabitants had built to fill the gap was made of whole tree trunks, but still looked like a child's toy next to the Pilots' ancient work.</p>
<p>Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the main square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who had left a week ago to collect Stale's clouds from their wintering grounds in the high peaks. Three hundred people were there, from babies in their mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, all in an uncertain muttering half-circle.</p>
<p>A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front of them. Each one had a battle mask painted with fierce swirls of red and black pushed up on top of his head. Leather armor, as thick as bootsoles and studded with metal, protected their bodies, while heavy wool kilts reached from their waists to their knees. Some had swords in scabbards on their hips, while others had bows or spears, but each had a heavy pack on his back.</p>
<p>And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting. One man's hand was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling. None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.</p>
<p>But Noxy didn't see any of that right away. What she saw instead was the tiger. His stripes were dark brown on tan, not black on orange like the picture in the story book that three generations of village children had passed from hand to hand. A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear, and his tail twitched now and again as if the villagers' murmurs reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.</p>
<p>A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack as large as any of theirs. Four half-healed scars ran across his cheek, glistening redly against his near-black skin. His back was straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was from cold, weariness, or fear, Noxy couldn't tell.</p>
<p>Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve. &quot;Who <em>are</em> they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know. &quot;I'm trying to hear!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the square. &quot;Friends,&quot; she said in what Noxy thought of as her official voice, &quot;Friends, please. I know it is early in the year for travellers, but please greet Sergeant Dorbu and the Gifted Kulbinder.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers. The tiger merely blinked. &quot;They and their companions will be our guests for the next little while,&quot; Indy continued. &quot;I trust you will all make them welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long's a little while?&quot; Grappa Gas asked loudly. Noxy saw her mother wince. Everyone loved Grappa Gas---or nearly everyone---but as Granna Fee said, sometimes he had the manners of a constipated yak.</p>
<p>&quot;Until they are ready to travel again,&quot; Indy reassured him. Her eyes swept across the crowd. &quot;Their journey has been a hard one---they hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans. Sergeant? Would you like to say a few words?&quot;</p>
<p>The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as Indy stepped down. Like his men, his skin was black compared to the villagers' brown, and his head was fuzzy with wiry stubble. The two yellow ribbons around his sleeve were the only sign of his rank.</p>
<p>Before he could open his mouth, Grappa Gas asked, &quot;So, are you lot loyalists or rebels?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure he'll tell us if you give him a chance to speak!&quot; Heads turned as a burly man, all shoulders and scowl, pushed to the front of the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Noxy said under her breath. Grappa Gas's son Aft was the best cloudherd in Stale, at least in his own estimation. After one too many arguments over plans for the summer cloud drive, Indy had ordered him to stay behind and mend equipment instead of going with the other adults. Grappa Gas had happily taken the mayor's side, and father and son had been squabbling non-stop ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, thank you, honored,&quot; the soldier said. &quot;And thank you, people of Stale. As your mayor said, my comrades and I were trying to see if the pass was clear so that we could carry news to Chaghan. We---&quot; He paused, and for a moment Noxy could see how exhausted he was. &quot;There was an avalanche. Three days ago. It drove those of us who survived off the road into the forest. Everything seemed all right at first, but then the forest took offence and...&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Well, you can guess what happened next.&quot;</p>
<p>The villagers murmured. The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso Mountains from Uws in the south to Garheim's frigid shores in the north. It didn't hate humans the way the Jungle of Thind did, but it guarded its territory as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs. Gifted creatures that wanted to live in the forest did so on sufferance, while humans were not welcome at all, not unless they stuck to the handful of roads built long ago by the Pilots. Travellers who strayed off them were rarely given warnings, and <em>never</em> given second chances.</p>
<p>A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he continued. &quot;The worst of our wounded couldn't go any further, so our commander made camp and sent us here for help.&quot; All traces of his earlier smile were gone. &quot;That was yesterday morning. I pray they are still safe, but if they are, they won't be for much longer.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas broke the silence that followed. &quot;So which side <em>are</em> you on?&quot; he asked, his voice still loud but a notch less rude.</p>
<p>&quot;I have the privilege of serving Respected Shudarga in this matter,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu answered calmly.</p>
<p>A handful of oldsters gasped at the rebel leader's name, but Aft crossed his arms and nodded approvingly. &quot;Good for you!&quot; he said firmly, his glare daring his father to disagree.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas thumped his wooden leg loudly on the cobblestones. &quot;Good for them, maybe, but what about us? If the king's men come looking for you, these walls won't keep them out for long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quiet, both of you!&quot; Indy said sharply. She was a head shorter than either of the men, but the iron in her voice left no room for argument. She nodded at the sergeant. &quot;Please, go ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>The sergeants shook his head. &quot;We didn't choose Stale for its walls, honored. We didn't really choose it at all. We just washed up here because we need help. If you're afraid that'll bring trouble, we'll understand if you send us on our way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is sending anyone away,&quot; Indy said firmly. &quot;We may not have as much as some, but we take pride in our hospitality. I'm sure we can find some spare blankets to keep you warm and something better than hardtack to feed you for as long as you need to stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, honored,&quot; the sergeant said. &quot;But what we really want is a couple of clouds so that we can go and rescue our friends.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>The next five minutes were chaos. Out of the question, Grappa Gas said, whacking his wooden leg with his cane for emphasis. The king's law might overlook them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who wandered in out of the cold, but flying off to rescue their friends? Why, when the <em>tralpa</em> came back---</p>
<p>---they'd show him the gate and send him on his way, Aft cut in, arms crossed and brows knotted. The lazy good-for-nothing had run for the capital the moment word of the rebellion had reached the mountains, and hadn't been seen since. As far as Aft was concerned, he'd given up any right he ever had to tell people what the law was or wasn't. And anyway, if they were going to shelter rebels, it wouldn't matter if they'd come to Stale or Stale had gone to them. And anyway again, what would folk in other villages say if they heard that Stalers had left men in the forest to die? Saints, what would their own folk say when they got back?</p>
<p>The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones. Little whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart as people disagreed with their neighbors, or turned around to agree with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet another &quot;what if?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is going to go on forever,&quot; Noxy sighed. She and Sensy had stayed aloof on the sidelines, old enough to want to be part of the grownup discussion, but young enough that the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so stupid,&quot; Sensy agreed. &quot;I mean, they're all going to wind up doing whatever your mother wants them to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unless they get eaten by a <em>tiger</em>!&quot; The two girls shrieked and jumped as sharp fingers poked them in the ribs.</p>
<p>&quot;Rash! Don't!&quot; Sensy punched the smirking boy in the arm. &quot;I <em>hate</em> it when you sneak up on me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Rash smirked, running a thumb over the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a mustache. It had become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had told him countless times he ought to break before <em>someone</em> broke his stupid finger. &quot;But it's better than being eaten, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The tiger's not going to eat anyone, you big yak,&quot; Noxy said as scornfully as she could, her heart still racing.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know? He looks awfully hungry to me.&quot; Rash licked his lips and growled. &quot;Mmm... tasty, tasty human.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop it,&quot; Sensy said, punching his arm again. &quot;I mean it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ow.&quot; Rash rubbed his arm, looking genuinely surprised at the force of Sensy's blow. &quot;I'm just kidding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's not funny,&quot; Sensy grumbled, hugging herself. Stale's walls sheltered the square from the mountain winds, but the air was still cold.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway,&quot; Rash said, not quite rolling his eyes, &quot;What I want to know is, do we get to go on this rescue mission, or are we going to be stuck here with the littles again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we'll get to go!&quot; Noxy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Rash ran his thumb over his mustache again. &quot;Then why isn't anyone ordering us around?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth, closed it, then grunted, &quot;Wait here.&quot;</p>
<p>She strode toward the center of the square where her mother was speaking with the sergeant. The tiger sat impassively on his haunches next to them, twitching his tail at every sudden sound. The boy with the scarred face stood beside him. His face was beyond exhausted, but when his shoulders started to droop, the tiger growled quietly and he snapped to attention again.</p>
<p>Noxy's mother caught sight of her. &quot;Oh, and this is my daughter, Probably Noxious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Honored Noxious.&quot; The sergeant bowed slightly.</p>
<p>Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was immediately annoyed at herself. Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a silly lowlander custom. &quot;Just call me Noxy,&quot; she told him. &quot;<em>Anna</em>, which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on? We can go and start getting them ready while everyone's jawing.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well. &quot;Who said anything about you three going?&quot;</p>
<p>But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and had already assembled her arguments. They were definitely old enough---why, they were all going to be riding <em>real</em> clouds in a few weeks, not just tame old pair floating about in the cloud pen. And they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down the pass, and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do rescues, wasn't it? And---</p>
<p>&quot;Stop.&quot; Her mother held up a hand. &quot;You can go. But!&quot; she continued, &quot;But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna Fee, and that's all you do---ride. Understood?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded, trying and failing to suppress a triumphant grin. &quot;Yes, <em>anna</em>.&quot; As she turned to go, she heard her mother sigh and Sergeant Dorbu say, &quot;My men do that to me all the time too.&quot;</p>
<p>Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and more than a few tinkers and traders had been lifted out of a difficult spot after running into a bear or a pack of trolls, so it only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed. Coils of hemp rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen, and everyone kept an extra yakskin cap somewhere, just in case.</p>
<p>&quot;You look ridiculous,&quot; Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the wooden steps to the mounting platform. The older men had been teaching him how to embroider during the winter's enforced idleness, and had stitched what he claimed were eagle's wings onto the side flaps of his cap.</p>
<p>Rash looked her up and down. &quot;Really? Because I think you look amazing. Excuse me.&quot; He winked at Noxy and stepped around the pair of speechless thirteen-year-old girls to take his place on the platform.</p>
<p>&quot;Ears all!&quot; Aft called out, clapping his hands. Despite the cold, he only wore a sleeveless yakskin vest, knee-length wool shorts, and a sturdy pair of boots. His hair was braided back in a thick club with a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven through it for luck. &quot;I'm fore on Big Blue, Gas and Fee will ride spotter on Pillow. We'll down, lift, and out, quick and simple, and get our new friends back here for soup before you can sneeze. No adventures, right?&quot; He turned a steely glare toward Noxy, Sensy, and Rash, who nodded and mumbled, &quot;No adventures.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; Without any more more ceremony than that he walked to the end of the plank that jutted out from the platform, looked down to check that Big Blue was below him, and jumped.</p>
<p>Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath. One, two, three... Big Blue dimpled under Aft's weight as the burly cloudherd hit him dead center, sending gray waves rippling across the cloud's back. Aft rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly. Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in concentration as he mind-spoke to the cloud to rouse it from its morning doze.</p>
<p>Something twinged in the back of her head. She blinked, momentarily disoriented. &quot;Did you say something?&quot; she asked her friends.</p>
<p>&quot;I said, show-off,&quot; Rash replied, a note of envy in his voice. &quot;Look, he's coming up.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shook her head, the strange feeling already half-forgotten as Big Blue rose slowly toward the platform, bunching in on itself as it came. Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the cloud's back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.</p>
<p>A silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, trilling its startled displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away. Aft looked up and smiled they way he only did when he was on a cloud. &quot;You want me to get Pillow for you?&quot; he called up to his father.</p>
<p>&quot;No need, I can---damn that boy!&quot; Grappa Gas harrumphed as Aft took three long strides across Big Blue's back and launched himself into the air again.</p>
<p>Rash whistled. &quot;Nice leap,&quot; he said appreciatively as Aft landed squarely in the middle of Pillow's back with an audible <em>poof!</em> &quot;And blind, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not such a trick,&quot; Noxy said dismissively, though she was secretly impressed. &quot;He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, but would you trust a cloud's eyes that much?&quot; Rash challenged her. &quot;Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out of what they say.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. She had realized early in their training that mind-talking was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash, or even for some of the olders who had been riding clouds for years. She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing off. The only person she shared her progress with now was Granna Fee, and even she didn't---</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em> She winced and put her hand on the back of her head. There it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?</p>
<p>This time Sensy noticed. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Noxy lied. One of the few things Aft and Grappa Gas agreed on was that cloudherds shouldn't fly if they were sick, so she wasn't going to admit to anything that might give them an excuse to leave her behind.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas pulled a small scrimshawed yak horn from the leather sheath on his belt. &quot;Here,&quot; he said, handing it to Rash. &quot;Let's see if you've been paying attention to your lessons.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy nodded and raised it to his lips to blow two long notes, <em>dee</em> <em>dah</em>. Big Blue obediently turned and drifted over to the platform. It was hard to train a cloud to answer to sound, and much less reliable than mind-speech, but it was one of the hundred skills the teens had to master if they hoped to ride the giant creatures on their own some day.</p>
<p>Aft brought Pillow up next to Big Blue and stepped off nonchalantly. With a mutter and a glare, Grappa Gas told the teenagers to get on, get on, they didn't have all day. He and Granna Fee followed. &quot;Oof,&quot; Noxy's grandmother said as she sat cross-legged. &quot;That's not as easy as it used to be.&quot; But then she smiled like the girl she had once been and put her arm around Noxy. Her granddaughter leaned against her the way she had so many times before, wondering when and how her grandmother had grown so small.</p>
<p>Behind them, Rash nudged Sensy with his elbow. &quot;You can lean on me if you get cold, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Sensy sniffed. &quot;I don't expect I'll ever get <em>that</em> cold.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee pressed her hand against Pillow and closed her eyes. The cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the spiderweb gate that hung down over mouth of the gorge. Meanwhile, two of Stale's other oldsters climbed aboard Big Blue. As they took their places behind Aft, the cloud slowly began to sink.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold him there,&quot; Indy called to Aft. She turned to Sergeant Dorbu. &quot;Go ahead---jump.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um...&quot; Sergeant Dorbu looked from the cloud to Indy and back again. &quot;Wouldn't it have been simpler for me just to climb on like everyone else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Indy said. &quot;But everyone has to jump their first time. For luck,&quot; she added cheerfully.</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so, honored,&quot; the sergeant replied dubiously. He glanced at the two soldiers beside him. With muttered prayers to the Pilots to watch over them, the three men pulled their battle masks down over their faces and jumped.</p>
<p><em>Poof!</em> <em>Poof!</em> <em>Poof!</em> The three lowland soldiers hit the cloud feet-first and immediately toppled over.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind yourself, he's a bit slippery,&quot; Aft said as the sergeant and his men struggled unsuccessfully to stand. &quot;Probably best if you just sit. You'll spook him if you keep tumbling about like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ready?&quot; Granna Fee called from Pillow's back. Without waiting for an answer, she turned the cloud toward the cloud pen's gate, muttering softly as she mind-spoke her orders.</p>
<p>Cloudherding is cold work. In the spring, in the mountains, when breath still fogs at mid-day and the wind pokes its fingers through every loose seam and down every collar, it's beyond freezing. A hundred heartbeats after they left the cloud pen, Granna Fee had wrapped a fleece around herself and Noxy, leaving only their faces exposed. Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy said, he might be a yak, but at least he was a <em>warm</em> yak.</p>
<p>Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected. &quot;Saints and their inventions, but I miss this,&quot; he sighed. He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden leg on so that it wouldn't poke into Pillow, but was dressed in the same long coat and scarf that he had been wearing when the soldiers arrived. &quot;Look, the condors are back in their nest! We should invite them them to visit some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're not really the most sociable of creatures,&quot; Granna Fee said dryly.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas harrumphed. &quot;You just have to get to know them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think they'd want to meet the tiger?&quot; Noxy asked. &quot;I mean, another Gifted might...&quot; She trailed off.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's worry about today before we start making social arrangements,&quot; Granna Fee said.</p>
<p>It had taken Sergeant Dorbu and his men a day to hike up the pass to Stale Leftovers. The clouds covered the same distance in less than an hour, even with the headwind. &quot;There,&quot; Granna Fee said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas frowned. &quot;I thought he said there were just a few of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee frowned too. &quot;Maybe 'a few' means something different to lowlanders.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren outcrop of rock that rose out of the forest like an island. Two dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire. Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw a handful of men moving about, some propped against one another to stay upright.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas gave a low whistle. &quot;Aft's not going to like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither is my daughter,&quot; Granna Fee replied darkly.</p>
<p>One of the injured soldiers spotted the clouds a moment later. The cloudherds were too far away to hear his shouts, but there was no mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms. Other soldiers crawled out of their tents and began waving and shouting as well as Aft steered Big Blue in a long arc to the upwind side of the outcrop. After a brief argument conducted via tooted horns, Granna Fee had Pillow hover directly above the camp.</p>
<p>&quot;You lot keep your eyes wide,&quot; Grappa Gas ordered the teenagers curtly. &quot;Forest might be happy to let us take them, or it might not.&quot;</p>
<p>Big Blue descended until he bumped against the edge of the outcrop, his back level with its top. The older cloudherds riding with Aft stayed on board while he strode forward, barking orders to hurry the soldiers along. Only a few windborne words reached Noxy, but that was enough for her to know that he was telling the injured men to leave their gear, to leave their tents, to leave everything they couldn't pick up <em>right away</em>.</p>
<p>In singles and pairs, the men struggled to clamber onto Big Blue's back. A few wore their battle masks, but most had tied them out of the way on the backs of their helmets. It made them look like a doll Noxy had once seen with one happy face and one sad, except the soldiers' looked fierce and weary.</p>
<p>The older cloudherds helped drag the worst of the injured onto the cloud, spacing the soldiers out to keep their weight balanced. Meanwhile, a soldier began arguing with Aft, pointing at a large tent standing a short distance away from the others. Other soldiers joined in, until Aft was facing a half-circle of angry men.</p>
<p>Finally he threw up his hands in surrender. Noxy couldn't hear what he said, but half a dozen men broke away from the group and hurried as best they could toward the tent. As their comrades climbed onto Pillow, Aft made sweeping motions with his arm and pointed at the outcrop.</p>
<p>&quot;No no no,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered. &quot;You can take them all, lad, just get them loaded up and get out of there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? What's happening?&quot; Noxy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Butter-brain wants us to come in and load the rest,&quot; Grappa Gas said angrily. &quot;But look---over there!&quot;</p>
<p>Something brown moved behind the trees a dozen strides from the lower edge of the outcrop. Something else---something larger---briefly let itself be seen a few strides further away. In singles and pairs and packs, the forest was mustering.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas spat over Pillow's side. &quot;They're holding back for now,&quot; he said. &quot;But if we go in, they'll be on us like an avalanche.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not your decision to make,&quot; Granna Fee told him. &quot;Aft's riding fore on this one, and---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;---and you follow your fore. I know, I know. Saints.&quot; Grappa Gas looked like he wanted to spit again.</p>
<p>Granna Fee pressed her palm into Pillow's back and closed her eyes. The cloud began to descend.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas glared at the three teenagers. &quot;You see something, you shout, got it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, grappa,&quot; Noxy said. Rash and Sensy just nodded.</p>
<p>Ten heartbeats, twenty... They were level with the camp. Granna Fee halted their descent long enough for Pillow to lift off and drift out of their way. &quot;Hurry up!&quot; Grappa Gas shouted, waving urgently.</p>
<p>The soldiers who had gone back to the large tent struggled toward the cloud, each with a heavy canvas-wrapped bundle on his shoulder. As they made their way through the camp, a cougar stepped out of the trees. Catching sight of it, the soldier at the end of the line snatched a branch out of the fire and waved it, shouting, &quot;Hah! Get back! Hah!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; Granna Fee breathed. Beside her, Grappa Gas swore fiercely and yanked his slingshot out of his belt. In one smooth motion he folded its brace down against his forearm, pulled a water-smoothed rock from his pocket, drew, aimed, and fired.</p>
<p><em>Thwack!</em> Even from thirty strides away, Noxy heard the stone strike the branch and send it flying. &quot;Run, you idiot, run!&quot; Grappa Gas shouted.</p>
<p>It was too late. The forest was awake, and angry. Sensy shrieked as a brown bear charged out of the trees to rear up on its hind legs and roar, &quot;Get them!&quot; Another bear joined it, then a cougar, and then the trees were boiling with trolls, dozens of them, hooting and shaking branches until it looked like the trees were trying to uproot themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;Get them!&quot; the Gifted bear roared again, and the animals charged. Bears and cougars, a snarling wolverine, trolls on all fours with their teeth bared, all came roaring and snarling and hooting through the camp, the Gifted and the ordinary side by side, their own feuds forgotten because someone had raised fire against the forest.</p>
<p>The first of the soldiers fell to one knee, dragged himself back to his feet, and fell forward onto Pillow's flank. &quot;I've got you!&quot; Rash shouted, dragging the bundle and then the soldier up onto the cloud. Another, a third, a fourth, a fifth---</p>
<p>&quot;Look out!&quot; Noxy shouted at the last soldier as a cougar snarled and launched itself at him. The soldier spun around and flung up his hand as if to signal <em>stop!</em></p>
<p>The cougar crumpled mid-air and fell to the ground as though it had hit an invisible wall. The soldier doubled over to vomit, then stumbled the last half dozen steps to the cloud. Rash and Sensy grabbed his bundle. Noxy took his hand. &quot;Go! Go! Go!&quot; she shouted.</p>
<p>Pillow pulled herself into the air. A second cougar made a leap for the soldier's dangling legs and snarled with rage as it missed them by a handspan. Noxy felt herself slipping under the soldier's weight, but strong hands grabbed her shoulders. Together, Grappa Gas and Rash pulled her and the soldier onto the cloud.</p>
<p>Noxy rolled over and stood up. &quot;That was close,&quot; she said shakily.</p>
<p>&quot;Too close. Too <em>damned</em> close!&quot; Grappa Gas rounded on the soldier he had saved. &quot;We could have been dinner, all of us, and for what?&quot; He whacked the long bundle beside the soldier with his cane.</p>
<p>The soldier surged to his feet and caught the old cloudherd's arm. &quot;Stop.&quot; His voice was as cold as ice fields beneath them.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas tried to pull his arm free, but the soldier's grip was like iron. &quot;Well that's a mess of a thank you!&quot; he said angrily.</p>
<p>The soldier released him. &quot;My apologies. And thank you.&quot; He swept his gaze across everyone on the cloud. &quot;Thank you all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmph.&quot; Grappa Gas scowled at the impassive soldier. &quot;What was so aching important you just couldn't leave it behind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My men.&quot; The soldier nodded toward the bundle at his feet, his face set. &quot;I promised them we would give them a proper farewell.&quot;</p>
<p>Half a dozen expressions flitted across Grappa Gas's face as he realized what their cargo was. &quot;Ah. Hard world, lad, hard world.&quot; He hesitated. &quot;And that magic you did---I hope it didn't cost more than you can afford.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier glanced over his shoulder. Behind them, the forest creatures were tearing every man-made thing in the camp to pieces. &quot;It doesn't matter. All that matters is that my men are safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Safe as houses, honored,&quot; one of the men beside Noxy said, his accent as burred as any cloudherd's. &quot;And don't worry. Stale's folk will give your dead a proper send-off.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas spun around. &quot;You! What are <em>you</em> doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>The man who had spoken wiped a his nose on his arm, leaving a long streak of nose drool on his sleeve. &quot;Flying, by the looks of it. Hey, Fee!&quot; He patted the cloud. &quot;Mind if I take over for a bit?&quot;</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Later, in the diary she kept hidden under her mattress even though she knew her mother knew about it, Noxy wrote, &quot;There was a lot of shouting after that.&quot; Grappa Gas did a lot of it, just like always, but Granna Fee was almost incandescent. That man was <em>not</em> going to Stale. As a matter of fact, the only place he was going was off her cloud, right now, and the drop be damned.</p>
<p>&quot;Because he's been shunned!&quot; she said icily to the soldier who had been last to board---who, it turned out, was the troop's commander. &quot;He's never to speak to a cloudherd, never to set foot in our villages, and never, <em>ever</em> to ride a cloud again.&quot;</p>
<p>As weak as he obviously was, the commander didn't flinch under Granna Fee's fury. &quot;We needed a guide. He was the only one we could find.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would have been better off wandering around in circles than following the likes of him,&quot; Grappa Gas said darkly.</p>
<p>The commander looked down at the canvas-wrapped body at his feet. &quot;Perhaps. But what's done is done.&quot;</p>
<p>Nobody said anything after that. Grappa Gas sat shoulder-to-shoulder with Granna Fee, each apparently trying to out-scowl the other. Noxy, Rash, and Sensy huddled together in a vain attempt to keep warm. The commander sat next to the grimy ex-cloudherd and watched the mountains slide past, while the soldiers did what soldiers always do when they have a moment of peace: they fell asleep. One started to snore, stopping only when the commander nudged him with his boot.</p>
<p>With her hand on Pillow's back, Noxy could feel how unhappy the cloud was. It wasn't just that she was carrying strangers, or that those strangers were bleeding and miserable. When clouds died, they just spread out into nothing. The thought that something could end but still be there---that it could go from being alive to being like a rock or a log---made the canvas-wrapped bodies more frightening than storm winds and lightning combined.</p>
<p><em>Sh, sh, sh,</em> Noxy mind-spoke soothingly, stroking the cloud as if she was an overgrown house cat. <em>Home soon, then rest.</em> At that moment, she wanted it just as much as the cloud.</p>
<p>Aft brought Big Blue down in the clearing in front of the fortress gate. An ankle-high carpet of ferns and spring-green shoots bent under the cloud's weight as he settled into place. The waiting villagers helped the wounded soldiers to the ground and handed them heavy blankets and steaming bowls of sweet dark tea.</p>
<p>Aft slid down Big Blue's flank and strode across the clearing to Indy. Noxy was too far away to hear what he said, but from the angry way he waved his arms and the way her mother rounded on Sergeant Dorbu, she could imagine the conversation. Even more soldiers? And the forest had attacked? This was more than Stale had bargained for---a lot more.</p>
<p>&quot;Hasn't fallen down yet,&quot; the rescued mountaineer said, wiping his nose on his sleeve again to punctuate his disappointment.</p>
<p>&quot;Stow it, Yestevan,&quot; Grappa Gas growled. &quot;I hear another word out of you, and I'll put you over the side.&quot;</p>
<p>A cold shiver ran up Noxy's back. She and Sensy exchanged wide-eyed looks. People weren't supposed to talk about someone who had been shunned, but older children had whispered this one when grownups weren't around.</p>
<p>Yestevan just grinned at Grappa Gas, then winked at the two girls when he saw they were looking at him. Noxy glared in return, while Sensy huddled closer to Rash, not seeming to mind the protective arm he put around her.</p>
<p>&quot;Look---there's the tiger,&quot; Rash said, pointing.</p>
<p>Noxy shaded her eyes with her hand. Kulbinder was sitting on his haunches on the parapet of the wall above them, watching the second cloud come in with the same unimpressed expression that cats everywhere mastered long before they tamed human beings. His boy stood beside him, leaning forward to look down at the clearing. As Noxy watched, the tiger hopped down off the parapet, disappearing from view with his boy behind him.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas glanced at Noxy. &quot;Your <em>anna</em> isn't going to like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sh.&quot; Granna Fee waved a hand to quiet him. &quot;I'm trying to land.&quot;</p>
<p>Pillow touched down gently. &quot;Help the men get down,&quot; Grappa Gas ordered the three teenagers. &quot;I'll take care of the bodies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can give you a hand with that,&quot; Yestevan said, rising to his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;You stay out of the way,&quot; Grappa Gas said curtly.</p>
<p>&quot;Easy, old man, easy.&quot; The former cloudherd raised his hands in mock surrender. &quot;Just trying to help.&quot; He sat down again, grinning as if he'd just scored a point in a game no-one else was playing.</p>
<p>It took a few moments to slide the bodies down the cloud's flank into the arms of the waiting soldiers and onto the stretchers they had rigged out of blankets and alder poles. When Indy offered the villagers' help, Sergeant Dorbu shook his head politely but firmly. &quot;These are ours,&quot; he said. &quot;Though we'd be grateful if you could gather some wood for a pyre---we'd like to send them off tonight.&quot;</p>
<!-- FIXME: introduce the commander -->
<!-- FIXME: get Thokmay into the fight -->
<p>Whatever the mayor might have said in reply was lost as Yestevan slid off the cloud and sketched a bow. &quot;Greetings, honored. Everyone.&quot; He straightened up and rubbed his back as if to work out the kinks. &quot;Long ride, that. Glad to be back on the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a moment of shocked silence, and then Indy said, &quot;What are <em>you</em> doing here?&quot; in a bewildered little voice that Noxy would never have imagined could come out of her mother's mouth.</p>
<p>The commander's face was drawn, and beads of sweat were pearled on his face despite the cold air, but his voice was steady. &quot;He is with us.&quot;</p>
<p>Everything seemed to happen at once after that. Aft had been speaking to Sergeant Dorbu. When he heard Indy, he spun around, and when he saw Yestevan standing there grinning, he balled his hands into fists, took three quick steps, and threw a roundhouse punch that knocked Yestevan flying.</p>
<p>Or at least he tried to. As Aft swung, the commander swept his arm in a perfectly-timed circle that knocked the punch to the side. His other arm followed the first, somehow sending Aft tumbling head over heels onto the ground.</p>
<p>The tiger was there before anyone else could make sense of what had just happened. As Aft rolled over onto his feet, he found himself face to face with a mouthful of very sharp teeth. &quot;Honored?&quot; the tiger rumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;Let him up,&quot; the commander said. &quot;And then...&quot; With no more warning than that, he collapsed as the willpower that had kept him on his feet finally ran out.</p>
<p>Once again, everything seemed to happen at once. Under Sergeant Dorbu's direction, two soldiers rigged a stretcher out of poles and blankets, lifted the commander onto it, and followed Indy through the gate. Granna Fee stood between Aft and Yestevan, each glaring at the other with arms crossed, while Grappa Gas reluctantly admitted to Sergeant Dorbu that no, the shunning didn't extend to the forest, and yes, that meant that Yestevan could pitch a tent there if he wanted to. &quot;He can make a fire too for all I care,&quot; the old man added pointedly. &quot;A nice big one, right around the oldest tree he can find.&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu beckoned to the tiger's boy. &quot;You, Thokmay! Go fetch a tent. And a bowl of something---anything you can find.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're not giving him any of <em>our</em> food,&quot; Grappa Gas said hotly.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; the sergeant replied soothingly. &quot;I'm giving him some of ours.&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas threw up his hands. &quot;Fine. Come on, lad, let's get these clouds back in their pens.&quot; He climbed back onto Pillow, laid his hand on the cloud's back, and lifted off. A moment later, still muttering, Aft guided Big Blue into the air behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Noxy said awkwardly, not sure what to do next. &quot;I guess I'll go see if my <em>anna</em> has any chores for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If she doesn't, you can do some of mine,&quot; Rash replied, as he had a hundred times before. He glanced at Sensy. &quot;I guess we should go be useful too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess,&quot; she said. &quot;See you later, Noxy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;See you,&quot; Noxy echoed, feeling slightly bewildered as her two best friends walked away together.</p>
<p>Whatever else Noxy might have thought was cut off by a now-familiar twinge in the back of her head. A heartbeat later she heard the staccato blatting of Aft's horn come from the cloud pen, the quick, angry pattern that meant &quot;back away and give me some room&quot;. She caught her breath. Grappa Gas must have been bringing Pillow in too slowly for Aft's liking, but how could she have known that before she heard the horn?</p>
<p>Her mother was organizing people in the square when Noxy got there. Yes, the soldiers would stay in the trading hall---where else would they go? No, she didn't know why the commander had collapsed, but Granna Fee was looking after him, and she was sure he would be all right. And yes, there <em>were</em> a lot more than 'a few' of them, but there was nothing they could do about that now.</p>
<p>Indy caught sight of her daughter. &quot;There you are. I need you to go home and make some tea. Use the big pot, and all the honey we have left. I have the feeling we're going to have lots of visitors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's what I was <em>going</em> to do,&quot; Noxy muttered to herself, but her heart wasn't in the complaint. This was the biggest thing that had happened in the village since she'd been a little girl, and she was more than a little proud that it was her mother sorting it out.</p>
<p>The water hadn't even boiled before Grappa Gas showed up. He rapped on the door with his cane and entered without waiting for a hello. &quot;Hey, daffodil. Where's your <em>anna</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She should be back soon,&quot; Noxy said. She added a handful of tea leaves to the cinnamon bark and green cardamom pods already in the pot. It was an extravagance---the pack traders who brought such delicacies to the village wouldn't be back until the last of the snow had melted in the pass, which was at least another month away---but Granna Fee had always said that a good cup of tea was worth a thousand words.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind if I sit?&quot; Grappa Gas asked, settling himself on a stool that was at least as old as he was and watching hungrily as Noxy drizzled the last of the honey into the pot.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you find out?&quot; Noxy asked after a moment.</p>
<p>The old man snorted. &quot;Just like your mother, aren't you? And your granna, too. Always thinking one step ahead of everyone else.&quot; He smiled. &quot;You know, if your granna hadn't been so smart, I might've wound up being your grappa. I remember once when---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grappa!&quot; Noxy protested. &quot;Tell me what the soldiers said!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how do you know they said anything?&quot; Grappa Gas challenged her.</p>
<p>&quot;Because they're a long way from home, and tired, and sore, and want us all to like them,&quot; Indy answered, closing the front door behind her as she came in. &quot;And because I saw you duck into the trading hall on your way down from the cloud pen. Now, what did you find out?&quot; She kissed the old man on his grizzled cheek and sat on the other stool.</p>
<p>For a moment all Grappa Gas could think of was how alike mother and daughter were. Noxy's hair might be brown and with a slight wave instead of straight and black, and her jaw square instead of round, but they had the same quick minds. When Indy had turned ten, he had predicted that she would be mayor before she was thirty. <em>Better start telling everyone that Noxy's going to take the job too,</em> he thought.</p>
<p>&quot;The king's men hit them while they were crossing the ford below Duck Droppings,&quot; he told Indy. &quot;Just bad luck, but they were split between the two sides of the river when they were attacked. Their commander did some sort of magic to help them get away, but...&quot; For a moment his years showed on his face. &quot;Fellow I spoke to doesn't expect expect he'll see many of his friends again.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy glanced at Noxy. &quot;This doesn't go out of this house,&quot; she warned. Noxy nodded, turning to the stove as the lid on the kettle began to whistle. She lifted it carefully with a pair of sticks to pour the boiling water into the tea, then replaced it on the stove and set the teapot on the table to steep.</p>
<p>&quot;What about the rebellion?&quot; Indy asked.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas frowned. &quot;They didn't say it, but the king is winning. And about time, too---he's got help now from half his neighbors, all worried that Shudarga's craziness might be contagious. If you ask me---&quot;</p>
<p>The front door banged open. Aft strode in and glared at Indy. &quot;How soon is that rotting turd leaving?&quot; he demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, good day to you too,&quot; Grappa Gas muttered.</p>
<p>Aft ignored his father. &quot;How soon, Indy? You know you can't let him stay. He's been shunned!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Glad to hear you talking sense for once,&quot; Grappa Gas said. &quot;But the real question is how quickly we can get those rebels back on the road. They've no place here.&quot;</p>
<p>Aft crossed his arms. &quot;Seems to me they have every right to be here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; Indy stood up and pointed at the stool she had been sitting on. &quot;Sit down and make yourself comfortable. Noxy, go get me the peeling stool from the kitchen.&quot;</p>
<p>Aft glowered at his father a moment longer, then hooked Indy's stool with his foot and pulled it to him. The brightly-painted stool creaked in protest under his weight as he sat down.</p>
<p>Noxy put the peeling stool down for her mother, then tried to make herself invisible as she poured tea while Grappa Gas counted off the reasons the rebels couldn't stay. What if the king sent an army after them? Wait, what did he mean &quot;if&quot;, of course he would. There were only three hundred people in Stale, and only half a dozen of them had ever held a sword. Not that they <em>had</em> any swords. And even if they had---</p>
<p>&quot;I'm surprised to hear you say all this,&quot; Indy interrupted. &quot;I thought if anyone would invoke travellers'' law, it would be you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, of course we have to look after them while they're here,&quot; the old man blustered. &quot;But this is different. When the king's men come looking for this lot, they're going to fight, and---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And until then, we'll make them as welcome as anyone else,&quot; Aft cut in. &quot;Just like the law says. They can stay as long as they don't raise a hand against one of ours or another traveller.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Raise a hand?&quot; Grappa Gas laughed angrily. &quot;You just got tossed backside over teakettle, and you're worried about their hands?&quot;</p>
<p>Aft's face darkened. Before he could loose another volley, Indy slapped the table with her hand. &quot;Enough!&quot; Enough, both of you. We have a stormload of trouble to fly through, and I will <em>not</em> have you making it worse with your bickering.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy set a mug of tea in front of her mother and two others in front of Grappa Gas and his son. Indy stared into hers as if hoping the tiny swirling leaves might spell out the answers she needed. &quot;I know it's a big thing,&quot; she went on quietly. &quot;And I did think about turning them away, but look at them. They look like they've been through the Blight. If a storm caught them in the pass, they wouldn't even make it as far as Rancid. How would that make us look?&quot;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas scowled. &quot;What people think won't matter much if our heads are all on posts. No, wait, hear me out.&quot; He slurped his tea and set the mug down with a clatter. &quot;What we just did, saving travellers who got caught on the mountain, we can explain that if we have to. But letting them stay here---saints and all their gifts, Indy, we can't. We just can't. Never mind the trouble it'll bring when the king wins---yes, I said <em>when</em>, and you know as well as I do that's what's going to happen---never mind the trouble, it's three dozen mouths to feed when we're already down to our last sack of barley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what about the tiger?&quot; he continued as Indy and Aft both started to reply. &quot;What are we supposed to feed it? Or should I ask 'who'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gastric Discomfort!&quot; Indy snapped. &quot;I will <em>not</em> have that kind of talk about one of the Gifted. Especially not in front of my daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmph!&quot; Grappa Gas snorted, which was as close as he ever got to apologizing. &quot;All I can say is, let's hope we don't get snowed in out of season, because if we do, I'm going to be keeping myself behind a good strong door.&quot;</p>
<p>As he leaned back, nodding in agreement with himself, Aft leaned forward. &quot;What I want to know is, what are you going to do about... <em>him</em>.&quot; From the way he said it, Noxy didn't have to guess who he meant.</p>
<p>Indy lowered her eyes and studied her tea again. &quot;Leave him where he is for now. I know, I know.&quot; She held up a hand to cut off whatever Aft had been about to say. &quot;If he stays out of the village and we don't talk to him or feed him, we don't have to do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's some pretty fine stitching,&quot; Grappa Gas grumbled. &quot;Hope the other villages will wear it when they hear about all of this.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy looked from father to son and back again, then laughed. &quot;Well, if you two are agreeing on something, it <em>must</em> be the end of the world.&quot; She drained her tea and set her mug down with a thump. &quot;It's been a long day. Let's all sleep on it and talk again in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>Aft and Grappa Gas nodded and drank the last of their tea, setting their mugs down with same &quot;conversation is over&quot; thump as Indy. Grappa Gas swirled the last few drops in his mouth. &quot;It's good,&quot; he said to Noxy. &quot;Maybe wants more cinnamon next time, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll try to remember,&quot; Noxy promised.</p>
<p>After Aft left, Indy asked Grappa Gas, &quot;Will you stay for dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &quot;Thanks, girl, but I promised your mother I'd help her, um, peel some potatoes.&quot; He winked, ignoring Noxy's little 'eww' of disgust. Indy smiled and kissed him on the cheek again. He was humming as he left.</p>
<p>Noxy waited until her mother said down again before saying, &quot;<em>Anna</em>...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, daffodil?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy hesitated. She didn't know where to start. &quot;Do you think the king really is going to come looking for them?&quot;</p>
<p>Indy sighed. &quot;I hope not. But what I really hope is that they aren't here long enough for us to have to worry about that.&quot;</p>
<p>The summer before, after years of ever-louder protests, a bookbinder named Shudarga had gathered her followers and marched on the capital. Grappa Gas had taken the royalists' side. Aft had argued just as loudly that the villagers should support the rebellion. After all, what had the king's law done for them except take half of what they brought home at the end of every summer and tell them they couldn't build a bigger fishpond? As the arguments grew more heated, Indy had taken the mayor's heavy embroidered collar out of its velvet-lined box, put it on, and laid down the law. This was the lowlanders' fight. The people of Stale Leftovers were <em>not</em> going to take either side, not while she was mayor, and if anyone didn't like it, they could have an election right then and there to sort it out. Anyone? No? All right, then, why didn't everyone get back to their chores, because they weren't going to do themselves.</p>
<p>The two sat in silence for a moment. Finally Indy stretched. &quot;So tell me, did you collect some spiderwebs, or did you and Sensy spend the whole day mooning after Rash?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Anna</em>! And how can you think about spiderwebs on a day like this? And anyway, Sensy's the one who's mooning after Rash and that stupid moustache he's trying to grow. <em>I</em> think it's dumb.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so.&quot; Indy raised her arms and stretched. &quot;Now, what are we---&quot;</p>
<p><em>Crash!</em> Mother and daughter jumped as something landed on the roof above their heads, sending tiles skittering down to shatter on the cobblestones outside. A low, menacing yowl sent ice up Noxy's spine.</p>
<p>&quot;What in the Pilots' names...?&quot; Indy crossed the floor in three steps and threw open the door just in time to see a troll land in the narrow street in front of their house. She yelped and flung herself to the side as the hairy creature lunged past her and raced up the stairs on all fours.</p>
<p>The tiger hit the cobblestones a heartbeat later. &quot;Where is it? Which way did it go?&quot; he demanded, his ears back and his tail lashing.</p>
<p>The sound of a shutter being flung open upstairs answered his question before Indy could. &quot;Stop! What in the saints' names are you <em>doing</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was spying on us!&quot; the tiger snarled. &quot;Now let me pass!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; As the tiger came forward, Indy stepped into the doorway to block him.</p>
<p>He pulled up short with a snarl. &quot;I said <em>let me pass!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I said <em>no!</em>&quot; The mayor of Stale glared at the tiger, her eyes lit with the same angry light as his. &quot;This is <em>our</em> village, and you will <em>not</em> race around like a madman unless <em>I</em> say so, is that clear?&quot;</p>
<p>It was the bravest thing Noxy had ever seen her mother do, and for one breathless moment, she thought it would be the last. The muscles in the tiger's shoulders bunched. He braced his legs to charge---and then, just as suddenly, relaxed.</p>
<p>&quot;As you say,&quot; he growled, his tail twitching. &quot;But I still want to know who that damn chimpanzee was spying for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We call them 'trolls' here,&quot; Indy said, her voice still full of steel. &quot;They are our neighbors, and I imagine he was doing what any neighbor would do if a bunch of strangers showed up next door---having a look to see what's going on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was a troll up by the spiderweb orchard this morning,&quot; Noxy said, immediately wishing she hadn't when two heads turned to stare at her. &quot;Sensy and I---we saw it when were coming back down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How come you didn't tell me?&quot; her mother demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been kind of busy!&quot; Noxy said defensively. &quot;Anyway, it wasn't the same one. It was older. A lot older.&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger sat on his haunches. &quot;Is this normal here? Chimp---<em>trolls</em> coming this close to a human settlement? Because they very much keep to themselves in Thind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They usually do the same thing here,&quot; Indy said. She uncrossed her arms and gestured. &quot;But if we're going to talk about it, would you like to sit down?&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger regarded her coolly for a moment, then blinked and looked away. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, his voice calm once again. &quot;Perhaps some other time. I should see if the sergeant needs me.&quot; And without any more goodbye than that, he rose and loped out the door.</p>
<p>A moment later his boy leaned in, said, &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; and gently pulled the door closed.</p>
<p>Noxy let out her breath in a long whoosh. &quot;Well,&quot; she said shakily. &quot;That wasn't scary at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mother sat back down on her stool and squeezed her daughter's hand. &quot;Hardly at all,&quot; she agreed. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded. &quot;Sure,&quot; she lied.</p>
<p>Indy squeezed her hand again. &quot;Good. Let's scramble some eggs and call it a day.&quot; She took down their one frying pan and set it on the stove beside the kettle. &quot;Tomorrow, I'm going to see if I can get to know the sergeant a little better. And I think you ought to get to know the tiger's boy. Let's see if we can find out if they have any other surprises tucked away.&quot;</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>&quot;Oh daffodil, please, brush your hair!&quot; Indy set her tea down on the table and began to stand.</p>
<p>&quot;I can do it,&quot; Noxy protested. &quot;I'm not a baby.&quot; She dragged the brush she and her mother shared through her hair another few times. &quot;Is that better?&quot;</p>
<p>Her mother sighed, just as her own mother once had. &quot;Yes, I suppose. Honestly, someone would think you'd been possessed by lightning. Let's get going. We don't want to keep them waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>They walked through the village together, squinting in the sharp-edged morning sun. The air smelled of pine smoke and fried eggs. People sat in twos and threes on stools outside their houses wearing yakskin coats or thick sweaters above sturdy trousers and sturdier boots. The men knit or embroidered while the women picked spiderwebs apart apart and wound the strands onto spools.</p>
<p>Indy had to stop every dozen strides to answer the same questions. How were the soldiers getting on? What did they think of the village? &quot;We're on our way to ask,&quot; she replied over and over again.</p>
<p>Many of the village's oldsters didn't bother to hide their unhappiness about their guests, but the sourest face was Grappa Gas's. &quot;Has that tiger eaten anyone yet?&quot; he asked, forcing an awl through a scrap of leather. &quot;Or is he too busy racing around on rooftops?&quot;</p>
<p>There was no sign of the tiger when they reached the village square, but Sergeant Dorbu was sitting on the steps of the trading with a dozen wary but curious children in front of him. Sensy and Rash looked up as Noxy arrived. Noxy blinked. Had they been holding hands?</p>
<p>&quot;And this is called a greave,&quot; the sergeant said, pointing at the armored front of his boot. &quot;It's to protect me from vampire mice. See?&quot; He tapped it with his fingernail, <em>clunk</em>. &quot;They could bite that if they wanted, but all they'd do is blunt their teeth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What if they climbed up your leg?&quot; asked Sensy. Noxy rolled her eyes. Sensy could always be counted on to ask the questions grownups wanted to hear.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, well, then I'd---oh, hello, mayor.&quot; The sergeant stood up, brushing his hands on his kilt. &quot;The boy will be out in a heartbeat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, sergeant,&quot; said Indy. &quot;My daughter is looking forward to showing him the village. I trust you slept well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; said the sergeant. &quot;Although I...&quot; He blinked, then sniffed, then started to say, &quot;Excuse me,&quot; but the sneeze came first. <em>Hwah!</em> One of the younger children giggled, then clapped her hand over her mouth. The sergeant blinked and sniffed again. &quot;Sorry---too many nights in the snow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Visitors from down below often catch colds in our thin air,&quot; said Indy sympathetically. &quot;I hope it passes quickly.&quot;</p>
<!-- FIXME: explain that the commander has no name -->
<!-- FIXME: mention Yestevan -->
<p>The guesthouse door opened before the sergeant could reply. The children scrambled to their feet and stepped back as the tiger padded out into the sunlight. He wasn't as big as he'd been in Noxy's dreams during the night, but she still had to stop herself from reaching for her mother's hand.</p>
<p>His boy slipped out behind him and closed the door. Instead of his armor, he wore a plain brown rain cape. He kept his eyes downcast as the tiger said, &quot;Good morning, mayor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, respected,&quot; Indy replied. &quot;I trust you slept well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, I did.&quot; The tiger seemed not to notice that thirty pairs of eyes were staring at him. <em>He must be used to it,</em> Noxy thought.</p>
<p>Indy waited a moment to see if he would say anything more. When he didn't, she smiled and said, &quot;My daughter has asked if you could spare your boy for an hour so that she could show him our village while the other children do their chores.&quot; Noxy heard Rash mutter something at that. &quot;If he would like to---oh dear.&quot; She stopped mid-sentence as the sergeant took a deep breath and scrunched up his face. &quot;Nope,&quot; he whooshed a moment later, blinking. &quot;That one's not ripe yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd be better in bed than tramping around the countryside, sergeant,&quot; Kulbinder rumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree,&quot; said Indy firmly. &quot;My mother will make you some lemon ginger tea. That will set you right in no time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thang you,&quot; the sergeant said stuffily. &quot;Honored tiger, will you---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will explore the forest,&quot; the tiger declared. &quot;I would rather we were not surprised as we were at the ford.&quot; And with no more ceremony than that, he padded off toward the main gate.</p>
<!-- ask about the commander -->
<p>Indy clapped her hands. &quot;Right. Everyone else, time for chores.&quot; As the children groaned and got to their feet, the tiger's boy finally raised his eyes to look at Noxy.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; he said, stepping down to the cobblestones and bowing ever so slightly. &quot;My name is Thokmay. I'm pleased to meet you.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy stuck out her hand. &quot;Hi. I'm Probably Noxious, but call me Noxy---everyone does.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy hesitated for a heartbeat, then shook her hand with a strong, callused grip. He gestured toward the gate. &quot;After you.&quot;</p>
<p>They set off side by side. &quot;That's the South Tower,&quot; said Noxy, pointing at six rectangular stories of stone. &quot;It still has a roof, but the stairs inside fell down a long time ago. You used to be able to get up there by climbing a tree, but they cut it down after Grappa Gas fell out of it when he was little and broke his arm. And that one's the Round Tower, and the short one over there is called the Quick Tower, because it's quickest to get up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a shame they've been allowed to go to ruin,&quot; said Thokmay. &quot;Respected Shudarga's engineers have been working all year to strengthen the walls of Panday Castle. Perhaps when the war is over she could send some here to fix them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Noxy replied vaguely. She wondered how Grappa Gas would feel about having rebel engineers clambering around the village's wall. &quot;Oh, and that's Granna Fee's house, the one with the moss green door. She's my grandmother. And she teaches school. And that's Grappa Gas's house, with the lavender one. He used to be mayor before my <em>anna</em>. And that's, um, well, they're all just different people's houses. Except those ones---those aren't houses, they're just for stores and drying things and... Well, stuff,&quot; she trailed off, embarrassed by her own rush of words.</p>
<p>Thokmay had a polite but absent look on his face, just like the one Indy got when Grappa Gas started talking about how things had been in his day. <em>It's probably not much compared to a real castle,</em> she thought glumly. Two-story houses with steep shingled roofs, little vegetable gardens nestled between log runners, and all around, sharp mountain peaks looming over the ancient gray walls... She wouldn't have believed how strange it all seemed to the young man beside her.</p>
<p>They walked in silence along the path that ran beneath the wall. Ancient cobblestones showed through the hard-packed dirt in a few places. Noxy scuffed crusts of frost off a few absentmindedly, wondering what else to say.</p>
<p>Thokmay pulled up short. &quot;What is that?&quot; he asked. A heavy wooden grill lay across a shoulder-high opening in the wall ahead of them. Behind it, rough stone steps led down into the mountain.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just an old tunnel,&quot; said Noxy. &quot;The grownups say they're dangerous, so we're not supposed to go in.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay nodded. &quot;Sergeant Dorbu will want to know about them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; Noxy asked. &quot;They don't go anywhere---or at least, that's what everybody says,&quot; she amended hastily. &quot;We use the ones by the shearing shed as yak pens, but that's about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He'll still want to know. Soldiers should know as much as they can about their surroundings,&quot; Thokmay said, as if repeating a lesson to a slow learner.</p>
<p>Noxy bit back a retort. &quot;Come on,&quot; she said. &quot;We can see more from up top.&quot;</p>
<p>The steps lay flush against the side of the wall. They had been built for the Pilots, not for human beings, so each one was as high as Noxy's knee, and so broad that it took her two strides to cross. Even after hundreds of years, the stones fit together so snugly that it was hard to tell where one ended and the next began.</p>
<p>Noxy put her hand on the wall to give herself a little extra push on each stair. She noticed Thokmay puffing and sweating after the first few steps, but didn't slow down.</p>
<p>The top of the wall was wide enough for three soldiers to march side by side. The parapet along its outer edge was interrupted here and there by slits for lookouts and archers. &quot;Makes Your Breath Rancid is that way,&quot; Noxy said, pointing. &quot;You can't see it because the valley bends, but sometimes you can see their clouds coming out of their pen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you call your villages things like that?&quot; the young soldier asked.</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged. &quot;They're called dragon names. They're supposed to make things sound unappetizing, so that when the dragons finally fly, they'll think twice about eating us.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay snorted. &quot;That seems pretty far-fetched.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, where does <em>your</em> name come from?&quot; Noxy bristled.</p>
<p>&quot;From the army,&quot; he replied, not looking at her. &quot;I had another name in the orphanage, but the army gave me a new one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Noxy cast about for something to say. &quot;Was that when you started working with the tiger?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't work with him---I work <em>for</em> him,&quot; Thokmay corrected, running his fingers across the scars on his face.</p>
<p>Noxy hesitated. &quot;Is that why you have those? To show that you're, you're...&quot; She floundered, unable to think of a better way to say what she thought than &quot;an animal's servant&quot;.</p>
<p>Thokmay pulled his hand away from his face. &quot;No. I got those for trying to desert.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth, then closed it. For once, she had no idea what to say.</p>
<p>Thokmay didn't seem to notice. Learning through one of the archer slits in the parapet, he pointed into the gorge below. &quot;Are those the clouds we were on?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy glanced through the neighboring slit. &quot;Yup. The bull is Big Blue, and the cow is Pillow. We've had them forever---they're practically tame.&quot;</p>
<p>The two old clouds were hardly moving, but Noxy could have watched them for hours---and had, many times, especially when she was supposed to be doing chores. She loved the way they slowly changed shape as they drifted about, and how soft they felt when she stroked them. Being on a cloud was like riding on a grownup's shoulders when you were little, only a thousand times better. You could see everything---deer grazing beneath the twisted pines, wild yaks standing on rocky ledges no wider than the heel of a boot, broad-winged condors making slow circles as they waited for a rabbit to forget to look up... When the air was still, and the cloud was just drifting, it felt like the whole world was a story that was about to be told for the very first time.</p>
<p>Thokmay stepped back. &quot;They smelled like wet yaks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That was just because they haven't rained for a while,&quot; Noxy explained defensively. &quot;We'll probably take them out tomorrow and let them rain over the fishpond. Here, come with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Descending the stairs was even harder on her knees than climbing them. Rather than cutting directly through the village, she led Thokmay on a roundabout path through the vegetable plots around its edges. She had seen the looks Sensy and Rash had given her when her mother had sent them off to do chores while she showed their youngest visitor around, and she wasn't keen to bump into them until they'd had a chance to cool off.</p>
<p>Once through the gate, she followed the trail at the base of the wall to the steps that led down to the cloud pen. Big Blue and Pillow were both floating fifty strides away in the middle of the gorge. The bull was almost at their height, while the cow drifted further down in his shadow.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you call them over?&quot; Thokmay asked.</p>
<p>Noxy shook her head. &quot;Not without a horn. You have to be touching them to mind-speak with them. That's what the ropes and cradle seat are for---see? A lot of clouds never learn to answer a horn, so someone has to be reeled out above them so they can jump on from there. It's pretty dangerous,&quot; she added airily.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; Thokmay said. He wrinkled his nose. &quot;But I still think they smell like wet yaks.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy bit back an angry retort. They didn't smell anything <em>like</em> yaks, not really, and if he thought they did, then---</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em> &quot;Ouch,&quot; she muttered, putting her hand on the back of her head. The feeling of something tugging the inside of her head was so strong this time that she was surprised not to find a lump.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Thokmay asked, eyeing her.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm fine,&quot; she snapped. She closed her eyes. She had hoped the clouds would be right next to the mounting platform so that he could stroke one. Or even get on, though she knew what her mother would say if she found out. &quot;Never fly alone&quot; was one of the many rules she dared not break---not unless she wanted to be grounded.</p>
<p>&quot;Um... Are they supposed to be doing that?&quot; She opened her eyes at Thokmay's worried question and blinked in surprise. Big Blue was no longer drifting in the breeze. Instead, he had turned and was flying straight for them. Pillow was rising toward the platform as well.</p>
<p>Noxy looked up. The last time she had seen clouds move this fast without a rider driving them on, there had been a pack of lightnings snapping and sizzling above the peaks. But she couldn't see anything like that---anything at all. What had gotten into them?</p>
<p><em>Bump.</em> Thokmay stepped back as the clouds nudged the mounting platform. Noxy pushed her question out of her mind and leaned forward to stroke Big Blue's flank. &quot;See?&quot; she said to Thokmay, grabbing a double handful of Big Blue's side and drawing it out. &quot;You can pull them all which way, but it settles back after a while.&quot; When she let go, the cloud's flank slowly settled back into its original shape.</p>
<p>Thokmay patted Big Blue gingerly. Noxy grinned at his caution. She'd show <em>him</em> wet yaks. &quot;Here, do this.&quot; She backed up, then ran at the cloud and threw herself onto his back. <em>Poof!</em> &quot;Come on!&quot; she said airily as Thokmay hesitated. &quot;He won't bite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Noxious Aftertaste! What do you think you're doing?&quot; Noxy's heart leaped into her throat. There, at the top of the steps that led down to the platform, stood her mother and Sergeant Dorbu. &quot;You get off that cloud <em>right now</em>, young lady!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's stomach was in knots by the time they reached the fortress gate. Her mother hadn't said a word to her on the walk back. &quot;Thank you for the tour,&quot; Thokmay said politely, putting out his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;You're welcome,&quot; Noxy mumbled. She shook his hand, dreading the storm she knew was coming.</p>
<p>&quot;And thank you as well,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu told Indy, bowing slightly over her hand as he clasped it. &quot;It was a pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're welcome,&quot; the mayor said. If she had been anyone but Noxy's mother, Noxy would have said she was blushing slightly.</p>
<p>As the sergeant walked away with Thokmay beside him, Indy rounded on her daughter. &quot;Tell me,&quot; she said coldly, &quot;What exactly would have happened if you'd slipped off the cloud? Or if <em>he</em> slipped?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He wouldn't have slipped off!&quot; Noxy protested. &quot;It was Big Blue---he's as safe as---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't care if it was Big Blue or the mattress on your bed!&quot; Indy said angrily, ignoring the half-dozen villagers who were very intently <em>not</em> listening just a few strides away. &quot;Do you know what the soldiers are doing this afternoon? Do you? They're settling all their friends who died before we could get to them. What do you think they'd say if we had to tell them there was one more to settle, just because you wanted to show off?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, mayor,&quot; Noxy said wretchedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you 'yes, mayor' me. Now, Achy gave me some thimbleberries as swap for those old boots you'd outgrown. I want you to get the seeds out so that I can make a pie for dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thimbleberries?&quot; Noxy said in despair. &quot;That'll take forever! Rash and Sensy and I were going to---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you should have thought of that, shouldn't you?&quot; Indy took Noxy by the shoulders. &quot;Daffodil, listen to me. <em>Really</em> listen.&quot; She combed her daughter's hair off her forehead with her fingers. &quot;Half the village is so upset about this that they're saying it's time for a new mayor. How can I ask them to behave when my own daughter won't? Now, go get washed up and start on those thimbleberries.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded glumly. &quot;Yes, <em>anna</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>She moped home to collect the bucket full of the first spring thimbleberries and a large bowl, then climbed to the top of the Quick Tower. She and Sensy had covered a tumbled-down block of stone with a bit of gray canvas to make a pretend cloud the year before. Plopping herself down on it, she started squeezing bitter grain-sized seeds out of the thimbleberries one by one. Why couldn't the stupid soldiers have washed up somewhere else? Why couldn't her mother have come along five minutes earlier, or later? And why did the sun have to be so...so sunny?</p>
<p>When she heard the first shouts from the main square she ignored them, thinking that it was children playing jump-sticks or <em>kabbadi</em>. Then she heard Sergeant Dorbu shout, &quot;Hah! Heeeyah!&quot; She tossed another berry into the bowl and stood on her stone seat to look.</p>
<p>She was just in time to see Thokmay duck under the sweep of the sergeant's sword and lunge with his own blade, shouting &quot;Hah!&quot; in turn. Both his blade and the sergeant's were wrapped in leather so that they wouldn't cut. Every child in the village was gathered to watch, and not a few of the adults as well, while Kulbinder sat on his haunches on the speaker's stone with his tail wrapped around him, his eyes on the mock battle.</p>
<p>The sergeant knocked Thokmay's blade away and spun around, slashing left and right as if he was beating off an invisible second opponent. While his back was turned, the tiger's boy stepped forward and ran him through.</p>
<p>Or tried to. As Thokmay thrust, the sergeant spun around again and beat his blade to the side. Over, under, over, straight---blow after blow rained down on Thokmay, each one barely deflected by his frantic defense.</p>
<p>&quot;Look out!&quot; someone shouted exactly one heartbeat too late. Unseen by Thokmay, the tiger had hopped down from his perch and padded silently into place behind him. As Thokmay retreated under the sergeant's relentless attack, he backed into the tiger and fell sprawling to the cobblestones.</p>
<p>The crowd groaned in sympathy. &quot;That's not fair!&quot; someone said indignantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Battles never are,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu said, raising his battlemask and holding out his hand to help Thokmay to his feet. &quot;Remember, it's what you <em>don't</em> see that will kill you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Thokmay panted. &quot;I forgot.&quot; He picked up his sword as the tiger strolled leisurely back to the speaker's stone.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu lowered his battle mask into place. He and Thokmay brought their swords up, touched blades, and started fighting again. Thokmay quickly lost again, and even from a distance Noxy could see that he was getting frustrated.</p>
<p>&quot;Again,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu ordered. They touched blades. <em>Thwack!</em> <em>Thwack!</em> The sergeant attacked immediately, driving his smaller opponent back once more.</p>
<p>Thokmay stumbled on a loose cobblestone. The sergeant lunged---and somehow Thokmay found his balance, twisting at the hips and sweeping his free hand up to catch Sergeant Dorbu's sleeve and yank him forward. The leather-wrapped point of Thokmay's sword poked hard into the sergeant's back.</p>
<p>A handful of children cheered. Sergeant Dorbu pulled up his mask. &quot;Well done!&quot; he said. &quot;That's quite a trick---where did you learn it?&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay raised his own mask. &quot;I don't know. I must have seen one of the other men use it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu laughed. &quot;Well, then that's two of you keeping secrets from me. Come on, let's go again.&quot;</p>
<p>They practiced for another half an hour. The children clapped and cheered every time Thokmay scored a hit. The older villagers shook their heads, their disapproval written on their faces. Still, they kept watching.</p>
<p>By the time the sergeant and Thokmay stopped, they were both soaked with sweat. They saluted each other one last time. &quot;You're getting better every day,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu said. &quot;But we could both use a sauna.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay nodded, breathing hard. &quot;Smells like we could both use one too,&quot; he said. For the first time, Noxy saw him smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Show me, show me!&quot; shouted Little Gas. He clapped his hands with excitement. &quot;I want to play!&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay's smile froze. He glanced at the sergeant, who shook his head almost imperceptibly. &quot;I'm glad you liked it,&quot; the young soldier said to Little Gas, pitching his voice to carry across the square. &quot;But it's not really a game.&quot;</p>
<p>He squatted so that he was no taller than Little Gas. &quot;I can show you something else if you like,&quot; he said. He looked left then right, as if to make sure no spies or grownups were listening.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you have any spare socks at home?&quot; he asked. Little Gas nodded. &quot;Good. You go and get me three pairs of socks, quick as you can, and three stones the size of your thumb.&quot;</p>
<p>Little Gas bit his lip. &quot;I only have just one other pair of socks,&quot; he said. &quot;They're for when it's winter, so my feet will fit in my boots.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, well then,&quot; Thokmay said, &quot;Do you think your mother would let you borrow some of hers? Just for a little bit?&quot; Little Gas nodded quickly and scurried away.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want the rest of us to get some socks, too?&quot; Sensy asked hopefully. She and Rash had been standing with the younger children, their chores either done or conveniently forgotten.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Sensy!&quot; Noxy said under her breath.</p>
<p>&quot;If you like,&quot; Thokmay said, straightening up. Sensy sprinted away, a handful of other children scattering in her wake.</p>
<p>Little Gas came puffing back a moment later. In his hands he had one pair of green socks, one pair of gray, and one pair with red and white stripes. &quot;Will these do?&quot; he asked, fishing some stones out of his pocket.</p>
<p>&quot;They look fine,&quot; said Thokmay. &quot;Now, give me your stones... Good. The first thing we do is we roll up the socks like this, with a stone in the middle, to make a ball. See? And then the next pair... And the next... Now, are you ready?&quot; Little Gas nodded.</p>
<p>Thokmay stepped back, took a deep breath, and threw the balled-up socks into the air. His hands darted back and forth like hummingbirds. Somehow, he managed to catch each sock ball before it fell to the ground, and then throw it again in time to catch the next one. He caught them overhand, he caught them underhand, he threw two with his left hand while bouncing the third with his right, and then he threw them all in the air at once and caught them, one, two, three.</p>
<p>There was a moment of stunned silence. &quot;That's magic!&quot; Rash said accusingly. &quot;You're doing magic!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not magic,&quot; Grappa Gas laughed, looking as delighted as any of the children. &quot;It's called 'juggling'! I saw it in Chaghan once, years ago. It's just a trick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; Thokmay agreed, &quot;It's just a trick. Here, I'll prove it. Sergeant?&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu took the brightly colored sock balls and tossed them in the air, one, two, three. He whistled a happy little tune as he juggled, and even managed to wink at Sensy (who blushed). By the time he was finished, Little Gas was laughing and clapping his hands. &quot;Let me, let me!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;I want to!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, but you have to let me show you how,&quot; Thokmay said. &quot;You have to start with just two, like this. Um, sergeant? Could you show the older children how it's done? Thank you. Now, put this one in this hand, and this one in the other, and...&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy watched Little Gas drop all three pairs of socks, pick them up, and drop them again. The little boy laughed. Seething, she sat back down on her pretend cloud and glared at the bowl of thimbleberries. It was going to be a long day...</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h2>
<p>Noxy was still on her make-believe cloud an hour later, squeezing seeds out of thimbleberries so angrily it was amazing the the bucket didn't take fright and run away. Sensy almost did when she reached the top of the stairs, but then she plopped herself down beside her friend. &quot;You should have tried it!&quot; she burbled. &quot;I only got them all up a few times, but it was so much fun! Rash could do it almost right away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure it was wonderful,&quot; Noxy grumbled.</p>
<p>Sensy pouted. &quot;Don't be such a yak.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not being a yak! I just think he was showing off. And what did Rash think about him putting his arms around you like that?&quot; The last time Noxy had looked at the juggling, Thokmay had been standing right behind Sensy, reaching around to hold her arms just below the elbows.</p>
<p>Sensy brushed her hair back over her ear. &quot;Why should I care what Rash thinks?&quot; she asked sweetly. Her grin turned into a leer. &quot;Or maybe you're the one who cares?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, <em>I</em> think it was embarrassing,&quot; Noxy said primly. &quot;You were all following him around like ducklings, just because he knew a stupid trick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, at least he didn't make everyone say please nine times, like you did when I wanted to play with the kite Granna Fee got you for your nameday last year!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy's mouth fell open. Sensy had never talked back to her before!</p>
<p>The same thought must have occurred to Sensy. She looked down at the bucket by Noxy's feet. &quot;Anyway, Grappa Gas is taking him for a ride now. It's instead of them going on patrol,&quot; she added hastily. &quot;The soldiers, I mean. Sergeant Dorbu said the commander ordered them to, but then your <em>anna</em> said they couldn't, and then they had an argument. Well, not really an argument, more like Sergeant Dorbu wouldn't take 'no for an answer and your <em>anna</em> wouldn't budge, so they agreed that some of the soldiers could go up for a ride, and the tiger was there and <em>he</em> said---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind what the tiger said!&quot; Noxy burst out. &quot;Aren't we all supposed to be going out with Grappa Gas for training today?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Sensy blinked. &quot;You're right. I forgot. But we can go out any time. If they're only here for a few days---&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy stood and glared down at her. &quot;What if they're not?&quot; she demanded. &quot;What if Grappa Gas has to keep taking them out and we don't get to fly and then we don't get to go with the herd this summer because we're not ready?&quot;</p>
<p>Sensy gaped at her. Her mouth opened and closed a couple of times before she managed to say, &quot;Noxy, what are you talking about? We're not going to be stuck here because---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what if we are?&quot; Noxy threw up her hands. &quot;What if---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop interrupting!&quot; Sensy stamped her foot, then clamped her hand over her mouth. The two girls stared at each other for a moment. Neither could believe that Sensy had snapped at her friend. Neither understood what it meant, but they both knew it meant something. Something had changed. Something was going to change. They were in uncharted skies.</p>
<p>Sensy stood up abruptly. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she muttered.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all right,&quot; Noxy muttered back. &quot;Listen, I've got to---&quot; She gestured at the bucket of thimbleberries.</p>
<p>&quot;Right. Um... So I'll see you later?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. Later.&quot; Noxy made a little half-wave as Sensy turned and went down the stairs two at a time, then sat back on her stool and kicked the bucket hard enough to send thimbleberries skittering across the stones.</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em> &quot;Not again,&quot; she groaned. She rubbed the back of her head with her hand. She still couldn't feel a lump. Why did this keep happening?</p>
<p>The second twinge a moment later was different. It was a tug, like the one she had felt that morning at the cloud pen. On an impulse, she clambered onto the parapet to look down on the cloud pen.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Grappa Gas was just coaxing Thokmay onto Big Blue's back. Noxy couldn't hear them, but from the beckoning motions Grappa Gas was making, she could imagine what he was saying. Littles jumped onto clouds all the time---saints, sometimes their parents threw them on when they were still in diapers, just so that they'd get used to the feeling. A strong young lad like Thokmay wasn't afraid, was he?</p>
<p>A moment more and Thokmay jumped. Like every first-timer, he immediately lost his footing and fell. It only took him one slow-moving try to get back up, though. Against her own wishes, Noxy was grudgingly impressed.</p>
<p><em>He'll let Big Blue rain on the fishpond first,</em> she thought, <em>That way, he won't be fidgety.</em></p>
<p>Sure enough, Grappa Gas brought the cloud around in a graceful turn toward the fishpond. The old bull didn't need any more instruction than that. He drifted to a stop, then started to rain contentedly. The pair of elders sitting on log benches beside the pond returned Grappa Gas's wave.</p>
<p>Noxy closed her eyes. She could practically mind-hear Big Blue's contentment as he slowly turned from dark gray to light. <em>Why don't you just drop him in the pond?</em> she thought despondently.</p>
<p><em>Bad,</em> she imagined Big Blue replying. <em>Bad hurt.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, he'd be all right,</em> she told herself. <em>The pond's pretty deep. And it'd serve him right for showing off with all his stupid juggling and swording and stuff.</em> She imagined Big Blue thinning out underneath Thokmay little by little. He wouldn't notice right away, not on his first-ever flight with Grappa Gas talking a gallop a breath beside him.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes in shock at the sound of a faint yelp in the distance. There, a hundred strides below her, Thokmay was sinking into the cloud.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; Grappa Gas shouted, reaching for him, but it was too late. Thokmay shrieked as he fell through the hole in the cloud and splashed into the ice-cold fishpond.</p>
<p>His head burst above water a moment later. &quot;Help!&quot; he screamed. &quot;Help me! I can't---&quot; He thrashed his arms as if he was trying to swim, but something was pulling him down.</p>
<p>Noxy's hand flew to her mouth. His armor! He must still have it on from when he and Sergeant Dorbu were fencing!</p>
<p>Kulbinder burst out of the trees and raced toward the fishpond. &quot;Hang on, honored!&quot; he roared as he threw himself into the water. He paddled to the struggling soldier, who threw his arms around the tiger's neck. Kulbinder turned around, but slowly, too slowly. The weight of Thokmay's armor, the icy cold water---they weren't going to make it, Noxy realized dumbly. They were going to drown. And it was her fault. She didn't know how. She didn't even know how it was possible. But she hadn't been imagining her conversation with Big Blue. Somehow, she had mind-spoken with the cloud a hundred strides away and told him to drop Thokmay in the water.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas was blowing his horn in the short-short-short pattern that meant someone was in serious trouble. Noxy heard an answering blast from below as someone in the village picked it up, and shouts as people asked what was happening.</p>
<p>Just at that moment, Yestevan ran out of the trees and shouted, &quot;Grab hold!&quot; as he threw a coil of rope toward the struggling pair. It splashed into the pond just out of Thokmay's reach. The young soldier let go of Kulbinder and struggled to it, his desperate thrashing sending gouts of water into the air.</p>
<p>He grabbed hold of one end and turned back toward Kulbinder. &quot;Save yourself, honored!&quot; the tiger roared. Thokmay ignored him. Three strokes, four, five---he reached out and grabbed the tiger by the nape of the neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Pull!&quot; Thokmay spluttered. Yestevan braced his feet and began to haul him in.</p>
<p>It was as if Noxy had suddenly been unfrozen. She raced down the stairs, yelling, &quot;He's in the pond! He's fallen in the pond!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Who's fallen---where are you going?&quot; She shot past Granna Fee and charged up the steps into the trading hall. There! On the shelves, right where it was supposed to be, lay the emergency bags that the villagers kept packed and ready. She grabbed the one she needed, shouting, &quot;Excuse me!&quot; at the gaping soldiers, and turned to run back out the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Oof!&quot; She plowed headlong into the commander, who caught her with one arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are you going with that?&quot; he demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Let go of me!&quot; Noxy struggled vainly to pull her arm free.</p>
<p>&quot;Not until you tell me who you are and what's in that bag.&quot; The commander's eyes were fever-bright, and his grip was like iron.</p>
<p>&quot;She lives here, honored. She's the mayor's daughter.&quot; Noxy recognized the soldier who spoke. He had arrived with Sergeant Dorbu, and was a head taller than anyone Noxy had ever met, and wide to match.</p>
<p>The commander held on for one more heartbeat, then released Noxy as suddenly as he had grabbed her. &quot;I still want to know where you're going with that bag.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They've fallen in the pond---the tiger and his boy,&quot; Noxy said breathlessly. &quot;They're going to freeze if I don't---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go,&quot; the commander ordered, stepping out of her way. As Noxy ran down the steps she heard him yelling at men to follow her.</p>
<p>Noxy ran across the square and through the gate. The path along the base of the fortress wall was still slippery in places, and she knew she should slow down, but all she could think was, <em>I did this. I did this.</em></p>
<p>Around the corner, down the steps, right, right again, more steps, and she skidded to a clumsy stop at the edge of the pond just as Kulbinder and Thokmay waded out. Thokmay took two steps and collapsed to his knees, drenched and shivering. The tiger made it a step further before turning back and hunkering down beside his boy.</p>
<p>Yestevan was pulling off his coat to wrap around Thokmay. &quot;Wait!&quot; Noxy said. She dropped the bag and undid the ties with haste-clumsied fingers. &quot;Here!&quot;</p>
<p>The blanket she yanked out didn't look special. Gray with a red border, woven from yak's wool, it could have come off any bed in the village. But it tingled slightly in her fingers as she wrapped it around Thokmay's shoulders.</p>
<p>The young soldier tried and failed to hold onto it, his own fingers stupid with cold. &quot;Let me,&quot; she said, pushing his hands out of the way and pulling it up on his shoulders again.</p>
<p>Thokmay nodded, still shivering. And then his shivering slowed and stopped. His eyes widened. &quot;What...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's magic,&quot; Noxy said. &quot;For emergencies.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as she said it, Thokmay was pulling the blanket off his shoulders to wrap around Kulbinder. Instantly, he started to shiver again. &quot;You have to keep it on,&quot; Noxy scolded.</p>
<p>&quot;H-h-h-help...&quot; Thokmay struggled with her for a moment as she tried to push the blanket back onto him.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh for saints' sake,&quot; Noxy snapped. &quot;Lie down!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are they all right?&quot; Grappa Gas yelled from overhead a moment later.</p>
<p>Noxy looked at the boy and the tiger lying side by side with the blanket draped over them. &quot;I think so!&quot; she yelled back. They had both stopped shivering, and they were both breathing normally instead of in short, struggling gasps.</p>
<p>&quot;Good work!&quot; Grappa Gas yelled.</p>
<p>&quot;You're welcome!&quot; Yestevan yelled back at him, his coat in one hand and the re-coiled rope in the other.</p>
<p>By the time Thokmay got to his feet five minutes later, Noxy's mother had arrived with Aft and a mix of soldiers and villagers. It took Noxy a minute to explain what had happened, and another minute to convince her mother that it had. Clouds did drop people sometimes, just like horses sometimes bucked people off, but Big Blue? He'd been with the village since Grappa Gas was Noxy's age. He was about as likely to hole under someone as the sun was to rise in the north!</p>
<p>&quot;Unless he was told to,&quot; Yestevan said, then spread his hands as Indy and Aft turned on him. &quot;What? You were thinking it too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Get out of here or I'll show you exactly what I'm thinking,&quot; Aft growled. Grinning insolently, the shunned cloudherd slung his rope over his shoulder, sketched a bow toward Kulbinder and Thokmay, and headed back into the forest, whistling as he went.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; Indy said to the bedraggled pair. &quot;Let's get you dried off and into the sauna.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be most welcome,&quot; the tiger replied with something that almost sounded like gratitude in his voice.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas met them at the top of the first flight of steps. &quot;Everyone all right?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No thanks to you,&quot; Aft said shortly. &quot;What the saints' names were you thinking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me?&quot; Grappa Gas straightened up angrily. &quot;I didn't do this!&quot;</p>
<p>Aft planted himself in front of his father. &quot;Really? You've been telling everyone you want them gone, and then they just <em>happen</em> to fall through a cloud you're herding into freezing water?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was the only one who fell,&quot; Thokmay protested, but nobody was listening---especially not Grappa Gas, whose face had gone from shocked to furious.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you listen here---&quot; he started.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; Indy pushed between them and pushed them apart. &quot;Stop this right now!&quot; She looked from one to the other. &quot;Our guests could use a long, hot sauna. While they're doing that, we'll talk about this over a cup of tea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tea! Now!&quot; Indy repeated in a tone of voice that implied the alternative was to repeat Thokmay's dive into the pond from a much greater height and into much colder water.</p>
<p>They walked the rest of the way to the fortress gate in silence. When they reached the square, Thokmay handed the blanket back to Noxy with a quiet thank you. He and Kulbinder headed for the village sauna. &quot;It will be like being back home,&quot; the tiger rumbled, his still-damp fur making him look both skinnier and more menacing than usual.</p>
<p>&quot;Give it to the soldiers,&quot; the mayor said when Noxy asked what to do with the blanket. &quot;It will keep someone warm even without the spell. Oh, and <em>anna</em>, can you please take Noxy for dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Granna Fee said. She had been waiting at the gate with her doctressing bag in case someone needed a bone set or a gash sewn up. She put her arm around her granddaughter. &quot;It will be like old times.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy was silent as she walked to her grandmother's house. She jumped when she heard a door slam, wondering if it was Aft or Grappa Gas. It wouldn't be her mother---people wished the mayor would raise her voice and slam doors when she got angry, but she never obliged them.</p>
<p>Granna Fee didn't disturb her granddaughter's silence as she bustled about her kitchen. Three ladles of water went into the kettle, which went onto the stove above a fire that hadn't gone out since the last time Granna Fee had taken a herd of clouds south to rain on the farms of Ninety-Nine Kingdoms. She cut two thick slices of oat bread and dropped them into a pan smeared with a few careful drops of oil, then chopped some withered mint leaves and dropped them into a pot just as the kettle started to whistle. As the warm smell of the tea filled the room, she flipped the fry-bread over with a fork, poured the tea, scooped the bread onto a plate, and set mugs and lightly-browned toast in front of Noxy.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, granna,&quot; Noxy said listlessly.</p>
<p>Granna Fee studied her granddaughter for a moment, then raised her mug of tea to her lips and slurped as loudly as she could. As the slurp went on and on, a smile tugged the corner of Noxy's mouth. &quot;Stop it,&quot; she said, trying and failing to sound cross.</p>
<p>Granna Fee set her mug down. &quot;I will if you will.&quot; She held Noxy's gaze, not challenging, just waiting, until Noxy dropped her eyes.</p>
<p>The old woman reached across the table and put her hand on Noxy's arm. &quot;You did well,&quot; she said, &quot;And your <em>anna</em> knows it. She's just got a lot of other things to worry about right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded. She hadn't been thinking about her mother---she'd been thinking about Big Blue. &quot;Do you think---will we be able to get another magic blanket?&quot; she asked, instantly regretting her choice of question.</p>
<p>Granna Fee shook her head. &quot;Probably not. Your father said he could only make one.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy picked up her tea. The mug was uncomfortably hot against the palms of her hands, but she held it anyway. &quot;Do you know what it cost him?&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee shook her head again. &quot;He never said. It's not the sort of thing you ask a magician.&quot;</p>
<p>She settled back in her chair, wincing slightly as something popped in her back. &quot;All he ever told me was how he found out he could do magic in the first place. He was fishing one day---not in a pond like here, but with a net in the ocean, back where he grew up---and he wished that he was done for the day. A heartbeat later the net fell apart in his hands and...&quot; She shrugged. &quot;No net, no fishing. But when he got back to land and tried to tie up his boat, he couldn't make a knot. Every time he tried, he'd drop the end of the rope or it would tangle in his fingers or something else would happen. Something had heard his wish and taken it as a bargain.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shivered. &quot;That's horrible.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee shook her head. &quot;From what I know, he was lucky. There was another magician in the town where he grew up who could teach him how to control it. But he still wound up making some bad bargains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like having to live where nobody had ever slept on the sea,&quot; Noxy said.</p>
<p>Granna Fee nodded. &quot;Like that. It saved someone from shipwreck, he said, but he was half-crazy by the time he got here. Even down in Duck Droppings there was someone who'd been on a ship once, so he couldn't stay there more than a couple of nights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you---do you think I might be a magician some day?&quot; Noxy asked as casually as she could.</p>
<p>Granna Fee started to smile, then realized her granddaughter was serious. &quot;Maybe.&quot; She put her hand on Noxy's arm again. &quot;But nobody and nothing can <em>make</em> you a magician. You have to choose.&quot;</p>
<p>They talked about other things after that, normal everyday things like when it would be time to shear the yaks of their winter wool and how Sensy only seemed to want to talk about her hair and her clothes, and how many dishes Grappa Gas would wash for a taste of honey. It felt warm and comfortable, and was almost enough to convince Noxy that what had happened earlier that day had nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>&quot;I should go,&quot; Noxy finally said, eyeing her empty teacup regretfully. &quot;If I don't get those thimbleberries done, <em>anna</em> will shear <em>me</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Granna Fee smiled. &quot;How about you bring them down here and we'll do them together?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, <em>granna</em>, but I said I'd do it.&quot; She stood, then impulsively stepped around the table to give her grandmother a hug. &quot;I love you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you too, daffodil.&quot; They held each other for a moment, one wondering when the other had gotten so big, the other wondering when the first had gotten so small, and then Noxy left.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Noxy walked home through the darkened village with a sliver of dayglass in her hand to light her way. Her mother was sitting at the kitchen table with half a mug of cold tea in front of her, brooding over whatever she had said to Aft and Grappas Gas. She forced a smile when her daughter came in, the tension in her shoulders easing only slightly when Noxy gave her mother a hug and kissed the top of her head and cautioned her not to stay up too late.</p>
<p>Lying in bed under a pair of blankets a few minutes later, Noxy looked up through the little skylight her father had put in for her when she was little and wondered what it had been like for him to realize he could do magic. Her thoughts ran from there to the ocean he had sailed on, the ocean she secretly hoped to see for herself one day, and then her eyes closed and her breathing slowed and she dreamed.</p>
<p>There was a house. Not a house like the ones in the village, with brick walls and cedar-shingled roofs, but one somehow woven together out of trees. It was deep in the forest---no, <em>she</em> was deep in the forest, sitting at a table just like the one in the kitchen below and drinking tea with the old silver-backed troll she had seen yesterday. They had been speaking about something important. The troll had asked her a question and was waiting for her answer, but she didn't know what to say. She couldn't even remember the question. It was the most important thing anyone had ever asked her, but she couldn't remember what it was.</p>
<p>She blinked. She was awake, still in her bed. A glance at the stars above told her it would be morning soon. Her mother was snoring in the room next to hers, a regular, comforting sound like someone pulling their boot out of a pool of mud over and over again. Noxy groped on the table beside her bed for her mug, remembered that she hadn't refilled it, and rolled over, annoyed at herself but not enough to get up. Within moments, she was asleep again.</p>
<p>She remembered her dream in the morning. If her mother hadn't looked as bleary as Noxy felt, she would have told her about it. As it was, they ate their porridge and drank their tea in a silence broken only by the occasional yawn.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; Indy finally said. &quot;Let's go see what's going to fall on our heads today.&quot;</p>
<p>But the day passed without incident. The villagers washed their clothes, weeded their vegetable gardens, mucked out their yaks' stalls, and scolded their children as usual. The soldiers tended to their wounded and their equipment with an occasional word of praise or thanks from Sergeant Dorbu. The commander was back in bed, the sergeant told Indy, but his fever was much reduced, and he apologized if he had scared Noxy yesterday.</p>
<p>By the middle of the afternoon, though, the sky started to darken over the peaks to the north of the village. The older villagers looked up from their chores ever more frequently, exchanging quiet observations and worried looks. Nobody knew how the clouds and the forest spoke to each other, but when the forest was hurt or angry, a storm was never long in following. In ones and twos people put aside what they were doing and began to make ready.</p>
<p>Stale was no stranger to storms. When bulls battled each other in the dead of winter, the snow fell so thick and so fast that people had to string ropes between the houses to find their way. And in the summer, when nimbus clouds that had stayed in the north to give birth flew south to rejoin their herds, the sky could darken in the time it took to sing a nursery rhyme. When that happened, the villagers knew it was time to tie their shutters closed and get the yaks into their pens, because the rain was going to come down in sheets instead of drops. Storm shutters that had been taken down at winter's end were put back in place. Children chased protesting chickens back into coops or hauled the morning's laundry off clotheslines to be re-hung in the sauna.</p>
<p>Amidst the preparations, Indy sent Noxy to the trading hall to invite the commander, Sergeant Dorbu, and Kulbinder to dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;Tonight?&quot; Noxy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I should have done it last night,&quot; she said, rooting through the vegetable bin in the kitchen. &quot;It won't be anything special, just---I thought we had some parsnips left. And did we use the last of the cayenne?&quot; She was still muttering as Noxy quietly closed the door behind herself.</p>
<p>She walked past the vegetable garden, where Little Gas was pulling apart strips of cedar bark so that Sensy could lay them along the irrigation trenches in the vegetable garden, and found Sergeant Dorbu sitting on the steps of the trading hall with a small brown pipe smoldering in his hand. &quot;Thank you, we'd be honored,&quot; he said in answer to the invitation. &quot;Though I'm afraid it will just be myself and Kulbinder. The commander is still...&quot; He waggled a hand.</p>
<p>Noxy hesitated. &quot;Would---I mean, if the commander can't come, would Thokmay like to instead? I mean, since the tiger is coming...&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu's polite smile broadened into something more genuine. &quot;I'm sure he'd like that.&quot;</p>
<p>The northern sky was as dark as a day-old bruise by the time Noxy got home. Diced onions were sizzling in a pot, and Indy was peeling what might well have been the last knob of ginger in Stale. Granna Fee had come by to help, and was busy assembling something out of oats, apples, and honeycomb on the kitchen table. When Noxy asked if she'd be joining them, she said, &quot;Oh no. Gas and I have plans for the evening.&quot; She nudged her daughter with her elbow and stage-whispered, &quot;He loves a good storm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Granna!&quot; Noxy and Indy protested in unison.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu knocked on their door just as the rain began to fall. His freshly-shaven scalp gleamed in the light of the dayglass lamp Indy had hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Kulbinder and Thokmay entered quietly behind him while he said his hellos. Thokmay stood uncertainly by the door until Noxy waved him toward a stool. Meanwhile, the tiger flowed up onto the chair across from Noxy without waiting for an invitation and watched impassively as she swept the last scraps of potato off the table. &quot;Thank you for the blanket,&quot; he said without premable.</p>
<p>Noxy jumped slightly. &quot;You're welcome. It's pretty dangerous, getting dunked in frozen water like that. It happened to one of the yaks a couple of years ago. She got out of their pen and tried to get across the---um. It doesn't matter. But I'm glad you're all right. And Thokmay too.&quot; She could feel her cheeks burning under the tiger's cool stare.</p>
<p>Her cheeks heated up even more when she saw Sergeant Dorbu's grin. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; he said cheerfully. &quot;He has that effect on everyone. Saints, I almost swallowed my fork the first time I met him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a spoon,&quot; Kulbinder corrected. &quot;And it was more than 'almost'.&quot;</p>
<p>And just like that the rhythm of the meal took shape. Sergeant Dorbu had a seemingly inexhaustible supply of stories about his own foolishness, clumsiness, and bad choices. Indy asked just enough questions to keep the stories coming, while Kulbinder's dry comments provoked protests of innocence and occasional snorts of laughter. Even Thokmay smiled, though he said little more than please and thank you.</p>
<p>As she tabled a tray bearing slabs of grilled cheese, fried onions, and gingered potatoes, Noxy realized with a start that she was actually enjoying herself. The mood was only slightly dampened by the tiger sniffing at the cheese and then saying thank you, but it would probably upset his digestion, he would find something in the forest after the storm was over.</p>
<p>Conversation became more serious after the dishes were cleared. The commander had declared for Shudarga the moment she raised her banner, and had been fighting ever since. &quot;Or getting to a fight, or getting away from one, or trying to get enough food in our bellies to keep us fighting,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu added.</p>
<p>&quot;So why did you choose her side?&quot; Indy asked as she splashed some dark mountain <em>rak</em> into a glass and passed it to him. Catching Noxy's eye, she poured a thimbleworth into another glass and handed it to her daughter. The pungent fumes tingled in Noxy's nose as she tasted it gingerly.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu rolled his glass between his hands. &quot;My family used to have land. Not much---just a farm with a couple of tenants to work it---but it was enough to keep us. Then one of our neighbors decided she wanted it. She honeyed up the local <em>tralpa</em>, promised him a slice of the takings, and then found an excuse to drag us into court.&quot; He spread his hands. &quot;By the time we got there, she had rented all the laws that would have saved us. We had a week to clear out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That must have been horrible,&quot; Indy said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&quot;It is foolishness,&quot; Kulbinder rumbled. &quot;The law in Thind is not something to be hired like a bullock. There are rules for each station. It is...simpler&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simpler <em>and</em> fairer,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu added with a quiet intensity that hadn't been there a moment earlier. &quot;And that's what Shudarga's fighting for. Laws should be there for everyone, all the time, not just for whoever has the most money on the day of a trial.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it worth killing for?&quot; Indy asked quietly.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu's voice was steady. &quot;I believe it's worth my life. And if it's worth mine, it's worth others'.&quot;</p>
<p>A shiver ran up Noxy's back at the quiet certainty in his voice. From the look on Thokmay's face, she knew he felt it too, and she suddenly understood why Sergeant Dorbu's men followed him. When he raised his glass of <em>rak</em> and drained it in one quick gulp, everyone else at the table did the same.</p>
<p>The thick black liquid felt like fiery smoke as it went down Noxy's throat. She clenched her jaw, but a strangled wheeze managed to escape. &quot;And that's enough for <em>you</em> tonight,&quot; her mother said in mock-disapproval.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, <em>anna</em>,&quot; Noxy said, gasping for air as her mother reached across the table and took the glass from her. Thokmay, Noxy noticed, hadn't even blinked when he swallowed his own mouthful.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu started to rise. &quot;We should probably---oh, thank you.&quot; He sat down again as Indy poured him a second glass of <em>rak</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Daffodil, could you go up to your room and get the spare blankets out from under your bed?&quot; Indy said, pouring more for herself as well. &quot;I'm sure the commander would appreciate them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure he would,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu agreed, his eyes on Indy. &quot;Thokmay, could you give her a hand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can manage a few blankets,&quot; Noxy protested, but she recognized the tone the two adults had used. She exchanged a look with Thokmay, who shrugged slightly as if to say, &quot;Grownups---what can you do?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy climbed the steep stairs with Thokmay behind her and pulled aside the curtain that hung in her bedroom doorway. Thokmay squeezed past her with a polite, &quot;Thank you,&quot; and ducked his head to enter. Inside, the dayglass that hung beside the skylight shed a warm orange glow as the sunshine it had trapped during the day slowly leaked out. The far wall was taken up by a narrow bed that Noxy suddenly wished she had remembered to make that morning. Three shelves at the foot of the bed held everything she possessed: her clothes, her little rock collection, half a dozen books she had borrowed from the village's library, and---</p>
<p>&quot;Where did you get these?&quot; Thokmay asked, picking up one of Noxy's knitted dolls curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;They were nameday presents when I was little,&quot; Noxy said, instantly hating the defensive tone in her voice.</p>
<p>Thokmay smiled at the soft little blue and white figure in his hand. &quot;My sister has dolls like these.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy frowned. &quot;I thought you said you were an orphan?&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay's smile instantly disappeared. He set the doll down exactly where it had been. &quot;Are these the blankets?&quot; Without waiting for an answer, he stooped to pick up the two winter blankets lying on the bottom shelf.</p>
<p>&quot;That was quick,&quot; Indy said as the two teenagers came back down the stairs. The bottle of <em>rak</em> was half empty, Noxy noticed, and the smiles on her mother's face and Sergeant Dorbu's seemed--- No. Her mother was just being the mayor, that was all.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's Kulbinder, honored?&quot; Thokmay asked.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu pointed his thumb over his shoulder at the door. &quot;Said he ought to do some patrolling. I think he's hoping to find a rabbit or something.&quot; He had undone the top button of his jacket, Noxy noticed. And her mother had untied the ribbon that held her hair back.</p>
<p>Thokmay hefted the blankets. &quot;With your permission, shall I take these to the commander?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good idea. Thank you again,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu added to Indy.</p>
<p>&quot;Happy to help. And you, young lady.&quot; Indy nodded back up the stairs. &quot;It's been a long day.&quot;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Indy lay on her bed, still in her clothes, staring up at the storm through her skylight with her dolls cradled in her arms. Her mother and the sergeant were still talking, quietly enough that she could only make out a occasional word. The tone said enough, though. She closed her eyes and hugged her dolls tight, but that didn't make her sudden loneliness go away.</p>
<p>She counted to a hundred after she heard the door close, then got up and went back downstairs. Her mother was still sitting at the table. The bottle of <em>rak</em> was empty, and the dayglass lamp was starting to dim.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you still doing up?&quot; Indy asked, opening her arms to give her daughter a hug.</p>
<p>&quot;Couldn't sleep,&quot; Noxy said, her voice muffled in her mother's shoulder.</p>
<p>Indy gave her a squeeze. &quot;Well then, why don't we make some tea? Here.&quot; She took the kettle off the stove and passed it Noxy. &quot;How about you go and fill that? It sounds like the rain's dying down, and a bit of air will help you clear your head.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded, not trusting herself to speak. She slipped her feet into her boots without bothering to do up the laces, pulled on her coat, and went out into the night.</p>
<p>Rain was still falling, but Indy had been right---most of the storm clouds had passed, and the few stragglers chasing them were already south of Stale, heading toward the plains. She watched them for a moment, then closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Idiot,&quot; she muttered a moment later. Of <em>course</em> she hadn't been able to mind-hear anything. What had happened with Thokmay had been a coincidence. She shouldn't---</p>
<p>Something clattered in the narrow jitty between her house and the yarning shed next door. She set the kettle down quietly on the front step of her house and tiptoed gingerly toward the narrow gap between the two buildings. Holding her breath, she leaned forward and peeked around the corner, just in time to see a shadow disappear out the other end. Who would be out in the rain? Curious, she hurried to follow.</p>
<p>&quot;Ow!&quot; Ten steps in, her foot connected with a pile of cobblestones that she and Sensy had put there as part of some long-forgotten game. The stones clattered as they tumbled over. Cursing under her breath, she stepped over them, wishing that she had taken a moment earlier to do up her laces. Some of the broken cobbles had sharp edges, and if she lost a boot now, she'd never catch up.</p>
<p>She reached the other end of the jitty just in time to see the shadow disappear around the edge of the tannery. She hesitated for only a moment before sprinting after it, her boots splashing in shallow puddles of rainwater. Whoever she was chasing was bound to hear her---the only question was whether she could catch them first.</p>
<p>She rounded the corner of the tanning shed a moment later. Her quarry was nowhere to be seen. &quot;Rot,&quot; she cursed. Left toward the trading hall, straight on toward the square, or right toward the vegetable patches and the gate?</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em> She shrieked with surprise as a bolt of lightning split the sky. <em>Crack!</em> A second bolt of lightning left a dazzling scar on the night. That one had been close---too close. The lightnings must be nipping at the clouds that had fallen behind their herd.</p>
<p><em>CRACK! BOOM!</em> Noxy shrieked as the third bolt of lightning struck the weather vane spinning madly next to the fortress gate and shattered its wooden pole. Splinters flew in all directions to clatter off roofs and cobblestones.</p>
<p>A door banged open beside her. &quot;Saints!&quot; Aft hurried over to Noxy, his coat held over his head to keep the rain off. &quot;Are you all right? What in the name of all that rots are you doing out in this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Anna</em> wanted me to fill the kettle,&quot; Noxy said stupidly. &quot;But---the lightning. It hit---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can see what the lightning hit,&quot; Aft said testily. &quot;Come on, let's get you back to---wait.&quot; He sniffed. &quot;What's burning?&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy grabbed his arm and pointed. &quot;There! Upstairs!&quot; A bright lick of flame was suddenly dancing in a window. Another joined it as the familiar herby smell of burning moss caught in Noxy's nostrils. One of the burning splinters had fallen into the piles of dried moss the villagers used to stuff mattresses and pillows.</p>
<p>&quot;Get your mother!&quot; Aft ordered, then cupped his hands around his mouth. &quot;Fire! Fire! Fire!&quot;</p>
<p>The village was lucky. That's what everyone told themselves half an hour later. They were lucky that the rain had made everything so wet, that there had been so little of the autumn moss left to burn, that Aft had spotted the fire so quickly. They were lucky the soldiers had been there to fill and pass buckets---with most of the grownups gone, well, the elders and children would have done the best they could, but things could have been a lot worse.</p>
<p>&quot;But what were you doing <em>there</em>?&quot; Indy demanded as she and her daughter walked home arm in arm. &quot;You were just supposed to refill the kettle!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I saw something.&quot; Noxy shook her head. &quot;I didn't get a good look at it.&quot; Which wasn't exactly a lie, but was an uncomfortable distance from the truth. As the soldiers had arrived to help with the fire, only one of them had been the height of the figure she had seen. But why would Thokmay have been out in the rain? And what had he been doing in the jitty beside her house?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Stale woke to the muffled stillness that comes after storms and minor disasters. The air was damp and chill, but the sky was so clear that the peaks around the village almost sparkled. A sharp-edged whiff of charred wood hung everywhere, sweetened slightly by the potpourri of the moss that the brief fire had consumed.</p>
<p>It was a day for dawdling: for taking a little longer than usual to get out of bed, for letting the kettle boil a few heartbeats longer than it needed to, for discussing the day's chores in a little more detail than absolutely necessary rather than getting up from breakfast to start doing them. No one wanted to hurry, not even the soldiers sent to patrol the road below Stale.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu spread his hands helplessly when Indy asked if the patrols were strictly necessary. &quot;Commander's orders,&quot; he said apologetically.</p>
<p>Aft nodded firmly. &quot;That's right. Have to stick to routine if you don't want people to go slack.&quot; Indy and Noxy had found the two of them in the square, sharing strong cups of tea and talking about the fire and how the moss-drying shed might be rebuilt, though Noxy was willing to bet that Sergeant Dorbu had done more listening than talking. The sergeant smiled when he saw Indy, and Noxy tried not to notice how her mother tucked her hair back over her ear when she smiled back.</p>
<p>A shutter clattered open above them. Noxy glanced up to see Grappa Gas glaring down at them, his own mug clenched in his hand. When he realized she had seen him, he scowled and disappeared from the window.</p>
<p>Indy followed her daughter's gaze. &quot;All right,&quot; she told the sergeant. &quot;If you think it's necessary.&quot; She put her hand on Noxy's shoulder. &quot;Why don't you round up Sensy and Rash and see if you can keep the littles busy this morning? We need to clean up the mess from last night, and they'd just be under foot.&quot;</p>
<p>By the time the soldiers and Kulbinder left twenty minutes later, Aft and Indy were working with a dozen elders to tear apart the ruined upper floor of the burned storage shed. Charred beams were knocked free with heavy hammers and set in a pile to have their precious metal nails pulled for re-use. In a moment of inspiration, Noxy had Rash and Sensy drag a few of the least-damaged timbers to the other side of the square and lay them out in a zig-zag pattern for the littles to walk along. Were they a tightrope? A secret path through a jungle? Or a bridge over a pit full of lava, and if you fell off, you'd be burned alive? The littles seemed to be happy to believe all three at once, and as far as Noxy was concerned, anything that kept them from interrupting her repeated yawns was fine.</p>
<p>It was shaping up to be a perfect morning until one of the soldiers who had gone on patrol came running through the gate with his sword in his hands and bellowed, &quot;At arms! At arms! They've found us!&quot;</p>
<p>The commander had been sitting on a stool in front of the trading hall making notes in a small ledger. At the sound of the soldier's voice he snapped the ledger shut and stood. &quot;Report!&quot; he snapped.</p>
<p>The soldier pulled up short and thumped his fist to his chest in salute. His left hand was still in bandages, and the stitches holding the gash on his check closed were crusty with scabs. &quot;Honored!&quot; he wheezed. &quot;They... they...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Catch your breath, soldier.&quot; The commander pulled a whistle from his pocket and blew it long and hard. The shrill double tone made Noxy jump. One of the children who had been walking the zig-zag of beams stumbled, then started to cry because she had stepped in the lava and had to go back to the beginning. Sensy shushed her, eyes as wide as Noxy's as the soldiers who had stayed behind tumbled out of the trading hall door, some on crutches, others still pulling on clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;Honored!&quot; The soldier straightened up and saluted again. &quot;Royalist rangers, honored. Two of 'em, light packs, with forest bows and short swords. The tiger got 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alive?&quot; the commander demanded.</p>
<p>The soldier nodded. &quot;Yes, honored. Chased 'em into us, just like we practiced.&quot; He gulped. &quot;But there was a bird with 'em, honored. A hawk or the like.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damn,&quot; the commander swore. &quot;Was it Gifted?&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier shook his head. &quot;Dunno, honored.&quot;</p>
<p>Indy cut in. &quot;Commander, does this mean there's an army coming?&quot; The question sent Sensy's hands flying to her mouth. Before Noxy could say anything to comfort her, Rash put his arm over her shoulders and gave her a squeeze. On any other day, Noxy would have been shocked and said something sarcastic. Right then, her only thought was a slightly bewildered, <em>But I'm scared too.</em></p>
<p>The commander shook his head. &quot;Unlikely, mayor. Rangers usually stay a day or two ahead of regulars. My bet is a regiment has settled in at the foot of the pass to hold it closed now that the snow is clearing.&quot; He scowled. &quot;But if these two don't report back---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;---someone's going to come looking for them,&quot; Grappa Gas said loudly, striding across the square to join the growing crowd. &quot;I told you, Indy. I <em>told</em> you.&quot;</p>
<p>The next few minutes were filled with the purposeful chaos of people who have long practice handling unexpected bad news. The commander headed to the Quick Tower, taking two soldiers at Sergeant Dorbu's deferential but unyielding insistence. &quot;Make sure he doesn't kill himself,&quot; the sergeant muttered to one of the men.</p>
<p>As they left, the sergeant picked a dozen men by name and told them to get their gear on. He sent the rest back to bed---they could still barely walk, and if there <em>was</em> going to be a fight, he wanted them out of it. But no, he didn't think there'd be a fight---not today, anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;And tomorrow?&quot; Grappa Gas asked. &quot;What are we all supposed to while you lot are chopping each other to pieces in the square? No, I <em>won't</em> shush!&quot; he snapped at Indy as she opened her mouth. &quot;Saying good riddance to the <em>tralpa</em> is one thing, but sheltering rebels, that's another, and if you think we won't be held to answer for it when the king's men show up---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It won't come to that,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu interrupted. &quot;I promise.&quot; He raised his voice. &quot;If the king's men show up in force, we'll either take our chances getting through the pass, or surrender. We won't put you in danger.&quot; He drew his knife and laid it across his palm. &quot;On my blood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No need for that,&quot; Indy said hastily, putting her hand on his arm to stop him. &quot;We're happy to take your word. Aren't we?&quot; She shot a stern look at Grappa Gas.</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so,&quot; the old man grumbled.</p>
<p>The patrol arrived back in Stale a few minutes later with its two prisoners, but without Kulbinder, who was combing the woods for other rangers. &quot;Or that damn bird,&quot; one of the soldiers said. &quot;I'm sorry, honored, I should have got an arrow off, but it was just so rotting quick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry about it,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu said, clapping him on the shoulder. &quot;Now, who do we have here?&quot;</p>
<p>The royalist soldiers wore the same kilts and armor as the rebels, but with blue ribbons sewn onto their cuffs. Both men had weathered faces and close-trimmed beards, though the larger one's was going gray while the smaller's was still as black as his skin. Both wore expressions of stoic resignation, and neither seemed inclined to answer the sergeant's questions.</p>
<p>He waited a moment, then sighed. &quot;All right. Mayor, is there a shed of some sort we could borrow with a door that locks?&quot;</p>
<p>Indy blinked. &quot;I don't think any of our doors lock. Oh, except the sugar cabinet in the trading hall, to keep the children out, but they'd never fit in there.&quot;</p>
<p>Beside her, Aft snapped his fingers. &quot;What about the tunnels by the yak pens? We could put them in there and nail some boards across to stop them running off.&quot; He gestured at the salvaged timber beside them.</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu blinked. &quot;What tunnels?&quot;</p>
<p>He blinked again when Aft showed him. &quot;Not that one,&quot; Indy said hastily in front of the one that Noxy had shown Thokmay the day before. &quot;It's too filthy even for prisoners.&quot;</p>
<p>They wound up choosing one next to the yak pens. As the two prisoners pried the old wooden grill off its entrance under the watchful eyes of the sergeant, half a dozen of his men, and a handful of villagers, Noxy studied the younger ranger. He was a head shorter than his partner---had it been him in the rain last night rather than Thokmay?</p>
<p>The grill clattered to the ground. &quot;Right, in you go,&quot; Aft growled. He had been holding a spare piece of wood like a club while the prisoners worked, clearly not trusting them not to bolt or the rebel soldiers to stop them if they did.</p>
<p>The older ranger spoke for the first time. &quot;What about the necessaries?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll get you a bucket,&quot; Sergeant Dorbu. He cocked an eyebrow at Indy. &quot;And something to eat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; she replied.</p>
<p>The two captured soldiers lifted a salvaged beam for Aft to nail into place. The older captive watched him bang the first couple of nails into place, then snorted and looked away. &quot;What?&quot; the cloudherd asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't say anything,&quot; the royalist muttered.</p>
<p>Aft put his hands on his hips. &quot;Well, you didn't say it pretty loudly. You mind speaking up?&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier shrugged. &quot;Just don't like seeing a job done poorly, is all,&quot; he said, his lowland accent turning 'seeing' to 'saying' and 'all' to 'ale'.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, poorly?&quot; Aft blustered. Some of the villagers hid smiles.</p>
<p>The soldier shrugged again. &quot;Don't mind me, I'm just here to hold the heavy stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmph!&quot; Aft placed the next nail and lined up the hammer with exaggerated care. As he swung it back, the soldier snorted again. The hammer came down squarely on Aft's thumb.</p>
<p>&quot;Ow! Rot and damnation, man!&quot; Aft stuck his thumb in his mouth, glaring at the soldier.</p>
<p>&quot;Leave him be,&quot; the younger soldier said. &quot;Worse he does, the sooner as we're quit of here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, that's it.&quot; Aft strode forward and held out the hammer. &quot;You're so crafty, you show us how it's done.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldier glanced at the hammer, then at Sergeant Dorbu, who spread his hands. &quot;As long as the job gets done,&quot; he said, struggling to keep a straight face. Some of the villagers weren't even struggling any more, and Grappa Gas was grinning outright at his son's embarrassment.</p>
<p>The soldier shrugged once more. &quot;Sure. Here, you take this.&quot; Grunting, the two men swapped places.</p>
<p>&quot;A little higher. Yup. That's it. Nope, in closer to the wall. Hold it.&quot; The soldier eyed the beam's position critically. &quot;Good enough.&quot;</p>
<p>And with no more warning than that he spun around and swung the hammer at Sergeant Dorbu's head. The sergeant barely flung his arm to block the blow. <em>Thud!</em> The hammer made an ugly meaty sound as it connected with his forearm.</p>
<p>At the same instant, the younger soldier flung his end of the beam at Aft. Aft jumped back with a curse so that the beam clattered to the ground at his feet instead of crushing his toes. &quot;Run!&quot; he shouted needlessly as the older soldier charged through the crowd.</p>
<p>Someone shrieked. The rebel soldiers chased after the escaping prisoners. The younger ranger feinted left, then lunged right to go in the opposite direction. Without thinking, Noxy stuck out her foot. &quot;Oof!&quot; The soldier sprawled facelong on the ground, and &quot;Owf!&quot; as Aft landed on top of him.</p>
<p>The two scrabbled for a moment in the dirt before the soldier suddenly relaxed. &quot;I yield!&quot; he said. &quot;I yield, damn it! Get off me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like hell,&quot; Aft grunted, twisting the soldier's arm up behind his back. He got up on one knee, then rose to his feet without relaxing his grip. &quot;What do you want done with him?&quot;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu was cradling the arm that had taken the hammer blow. His jaw was set and his eyes cold. &quot;Put him in the hole,&quot; he said curtly. &quot;You!&quot; He nodded at Noxy. &quot;Get to the gate. Tell whoever's there what's happened, but keep your distance, you hear? Don't try to stop him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Indy exclaimed. &quot;Wait! She's not a---&quot; But Noxy was already gone.</p>
<p>The escaped soldier had gone back the way they had come, but Noxy knew the village like her tongue knew her teeth. She vaulted over a crate someone had left out through the winter, skidded on a cobblestone that was still crusted with winter ice, dodged around Sensy's startled granna and grappa with a shout of, &quot;Look out, he's escaped!&quot;, and practically flew into the narrow jitty between their house and their neighbors.</p>
<p>Her boots splashed in a puddle left behind by the previous night's storm. As she burst out the other end, she plowed straight into Thokmay and knocked him off his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry!&quot; Noxy exclaimed, reaching down to help him back to his feet. &quot;Did you hear? One of the soldiers escaped! We've got to tell whoever's at the gate!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go,&quot; Thokmay gasped, waving her on as he tried to re-fill his lungs. &quot;I'll find Kulbinder.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy was already in motion again. She raced along the side of the trading hall and sprinted across the square to the gate. Three soldiers were standing there, two on their own feet and one on crutches. She quickly explained what had happened.</p>
<p>&quot;Hasn't come by here,&quot; the one on crutches said. He had a single yellow ribbon around his sleeve, and a thick bandage wrapped around his shin.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet,&quot; another added grimly, drawing his sword and hefting it in his hand. &quot;Best for him he doesn't, either.&quot;</p>
<p>Boots clomped on the cobblestones as Thokmay trotted up to join them. &quot;Is there any other way out?&quot; he asked Noxy.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &quot;Not unless he can fly.&quot; She hesitated. &quot;But if he gets up onto the wall, he might be able to jump into a tree. I've seen people do that.&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay nodded. &quot;The tiger is on patrol,&quot; he told the three soldiers crisply. &quot;I'll go find him and let him know about the escape.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll come with you,&quot; Noxy said.</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; Thokmay said. &quot;It's too dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy stared at him in disbelief. &quot;Too dangerous? I know the forest a lot better than you do!&quot;</p>
<p>Thokmay patted the sword at his hip. &quot;And I know a lot more about fighting than you do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take her with you,&quot; the soldier on crutches ordered.</p>
<p>&quot;But---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's an order,&quot; the soldier said sternly, pointing at the ribbon around his sleeve.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, honored,&quot; Thokmay replied woodenly.</p>
<p>The air was colder and damper in the forest gloom. Noxy rubbed her arms to warm them as she walked. Thokmay didn't seem to mind. <em>But he wouldn't with that thick coat on,</em> she thought sourly. It didn't look like it had gotten wet the night before, but if he'd been wearing a rain cape... And it would have had plenty of time to dry if he'd hung it up near one of the big fireplace stoves in the trading hall---their thick stone sides stayed warm all night.</p>
<p>Thokmay raised a hand. &quot;Hold.&quot; He pointed the forest floor in front of them. &quot;This must be where they fought. See where the branches are broken?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you say so,&quot; Noxy said, rubbing her arms more vigorously. Cloudherds learned how to read the sky before they learned how to read books, but woodcraft was mystery to her. Truth be told, she had never really liked being in the forest. The trees always seemed to loom over her. It wasn't too bad when the birds were singing, but when it was silent---</p>
<p>&quot;Why is it so quiet?&quot; she asked, suddenly realizing that she hadn't heard anything for the last hundred heartbeats except the soft pitter-pat of water dripping from the branches around them.</p>
<p>&quot;Sh...&quot; Thokmay made a cutting gesture with his hand. &quot;Something's watching us.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy shivered. &quot;Is it the tiger?&quot; she whispered. She glanced over her shoulder. They were only a couple of hundred strides from the fortress gate, but it felt like home and sunlight and safety were a world away. The forest didn't want them there. It didn't want their voices or their boots or the short sword that was suddenly in Thokmay's hand.</p>
<p>She pressed the heels of her hands to her temples. What was happening? She couldn't be mind-hearing the forest---could she? She must be going crazy. It was too much---it couldn't all fit. Her head was going to burst.</p>
<p>&quot;It's too big...&quot; Noxy whimpered.</p>
<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; Thokmay hissed urgently. &quot;Be quiet!&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy put a hand on a nearby tree to steady herself. The bark was cold and damp but reassuringly solid. The little beads of sap under her palm were frozen nearly solid but still sticky. She took a deep, shaky breath. She wasn't going to throw up. She wasn't. &quot;I'm all right,&quot; she said, though she couldn't have said whether she was talking to herself or Thokmay. &quot;Just... just a headache.&quot; Somewhere nearby, a sapsucker chirped. A squirrel chattered in response, and from right behind her, the tiger spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Kulbinder demanded. Noxy shrieked and spun around. The tiger ignored her. &quot;You should be in the village!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One of the prisoners escaped, honored,&quot; Thokmay replied. &quot;The older one. Took a hammer to the sergeant, but he'll be all right. He's probably still inside the walls, and Corporal Choegyal at the gate is watching for him.&quot;</p>
<p>The tiger growled. &quot;I've seen nothing. But you were foolish to come here.&quot; He glanced at Noxy. &quot;And doubly foolish to bring her.&quot;</p>
<p>Noxy opened her mouth to protest that he hadn't brought her, she had volunteered, but a now-familiar twinge stopped her. She squeezed her eyes shut, and suddenly she could <em>see</em>, really see, everything all at once through dozens of eyes. She was looking at her put her hand on the back of her own head from the branch of a tree behind her. She was motionless in the bushes, looking over Kulbinder at her own drawn face as she crumpled to the ground. She was a fifty strides away with one paw in the fast, freezing water of a little brook as the ranger slipped by on nearly-silent feet.</p>

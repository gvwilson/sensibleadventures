<td valign="top"><em>Bottle of Light</em> was published by Scholastic Canada in 2008 as part of their <a href="http://www.scholastic.ca/education/movingupwithliteracyplace/popups/g5-guidedreading.html">Grade 5 Guided Reading</a> series. It isn't available for general sale, since Scholastic wants readers to encounter it for the first time with a teacher there to help them read it, but I hope that I'll be able to share it with you some day.</td>

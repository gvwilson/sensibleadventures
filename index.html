      Take a mountain, lift it into the air, and set it adrift: that
      is Avaunt.  But look closer—there, in a village on its starboard
      flank. A girl is running for her life. She just felt the
      mountain shake for the first time in centuries, but that's not
      what she's afraid of. She's afraid of what the boy chasing her
      will do if he catches her…

      In the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless
      squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms, a girl is dreaming about
      riding on clouds while she does her chores.  She is no longer a
      child but not yet an adult, and has no idea that her world is
      about to change forever…

      Once upon a time, a young puppet named Still lived in a city
      full of wonders.  This is the story of the worst thing that ever
      happened to her: about violins and gargoyles, glass rats and
      friendship, and in the end, about—ah, but that would be telling…

      In the beginning there was a great Big Bang, so powerful that
      the whole universe is still expanding.  This is the story of
      what happened afterward, of the Earth and life and civilization
      and maybe, just maybe, of what comes next.

# And Should I Fall Behind
# Greg Wilson

*"They're coming," the younger warned,
eyes closed in concentration as he stretched his eldritch senses to their limits.*

*"Oh really?" the older snapped.
He shifted his alien black sword to his left hand and drew his blaster with his right.
It only had a dozen charges left,
and who knew how effective it would be against the half-dimensional horrors pursuing them,
but its weight was comforting.*

*Not for the first time,
he wished his brother was just a little less smart.
Just a little.
Just less-smart enough to not be able to piece together
the strangely-cold shards of a map made when the sun was still yellow
and–*

"Spoiler."
Robbie struggled to sit up.
"That's a spoiler.
We don't know how old the map is yet, do we?"

"Um…"
George flipped back a couple of pages and nodded.
"Okay, good catch.
That'll be easy to fix–it's just a bit of pencil work.
You want to keep going?"
He carefully didn't glance at his brother as he asked.

Robbie settled back on the bed that had been his home for the last two months.
He claimed he didn't notice the drip tube stuck in his arm any more,
but whenever George came to visit,
it always seemed to catch the corner of his eye.
It,
and the quiet machine it was connected to,
and the faint under-smell of sweat and antiseptic
that reminded him of their mother's final illness in the same room
twenty years before.

"'Sokay if we take a break?"
Robbie yawned.
He gestured at the laptop waiting on the bed tray in his lap.
"I had a couple of ideas for tweaking the congestion algorithms."

"Sure.
I'm supposed to get home soon anyway,"
his brother lied.
He tucked the loose pages he'd drawn that morning back into his folder and stood up.
"You need anything?"

Robbie shook his head,
already opening the laptop.
"I'm good.
Say hi to Boots for me."

"'Course.
She'll come by on the weekend."
George hesitated,
just as he always did when the time came to leave.
They had never been a huggy family,
but the one time he and Robbie had bumped fists,
they had both burst out laughing at how ridiculous it felt.
As far as George could remember,
that was the last time either of them had laughed.
"You sure you'll be okay?"

Robbie looked up from the dense tangle of simulation statistics on his screen.
"You mean, am I going to have another episode?
No idea.
But I'm recording my screen and the router is dumping all my traffic off site,
so if I do,
maybe I'll be able to figure out what I'm looking for.
You know,
when I'm not actually me."
And then he smiled their mother's smile,
the smile that meant,
"I love you but I'd like to get back to work now."

George closed the door quietly behind him,
went downstairs,
and slumped into an overstuffed blue chair that had been
one of Robbie's few additions to the decor.
He closed his eyes and waited for the tears to come.
When they finished,
he wiped his eyes on his sleeve and got shakily to his feet.
Six pages a day was a punishing pace,
but this was one deadline he wasn't going to miss.

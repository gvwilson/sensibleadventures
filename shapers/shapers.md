# Shapers

Shapers is a fantasy role-playing game for children aged 8-80.
It is inspired by my fond memories of *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
countless stories of talking animals,
and my daughter.

## Characters

1. Every character has three scores:

   * **Size**: how large are you?

   * **Health**: how healthy are you?

   * **Coordination**: how coordinated are you?

   An average fully-grown human has a score of 10 for each,
   but there aren't any "average humans" left in the world.
   Averages for other kinds of characters are listed later.

2. Every character has one extra score that depends on these three:

   * **Strength**: how strong are you?
     A character's Strength is equal to her Size,
     plus or minus *one* point for every *two* points her Health differs from 10.

3. Every character also has Sight, Hearing, and Smell scores.
   These are all 10 (average) unless otherwise noted,
   so they don't need to be written down except in special cases.

4. Every character has Shaping scores for different elements.
   These are all zero (no ability) unless otherwise noted,
   since most characters aren't Shapers.

5. Non-player characters (NPCs) may have three extra scores:

   * **Intelligence**: ability to solve puzzles, do arithmetic, etc.

   * **Courage**: how brave the character is.

   * **Honesty**: how likely the character is to tell the truth.

   Player characters (PCs) don't have scores for these
   because it's up to the player to decide when to be brave,
   when to tell truth,
   and to solve puzzles.
   NPCs only need to be given scores for these things
   when it's important to the game.

## Species

People are all part-animal.
Each species has its own "normal" Size and Coordination scores,
but all of them have an average Health of 10,
and all of them use the same score for calculating Strength.
Different Species also have different scores for Sight, Hearing, and Smell.

Species   Size   Coordination   Senses                Special
-------  -----  -------------  -------                -------
elephant    14              8   Sight=9               prehensile trunk
tiger       10             12   Smell=12, Hearing=11  carnivore
lion        10             12   Smell=12, Hearing=11  carnivore
bear        12              9   Sight=8, Smell=12
fox          8             12   Smell=12
wolf         9             11   Smell=12
cow         12              9   Sight=9               horns
monkey       8             13                         prehensile tail

Example:
Madica is a teenage fox girl.
She's a bit on the small side,
but she has worked on her parents' fishing boat every day since she was a child,
so she is very strong.
She is also good with her hands
(she's had a lot of practice tying knots and mending nets)
and has a keen nose.

Score         Value
-----        ------
Size              7
Health           12
Coordination     13
Strength          8
Smell            12

## Shaping

Shaping is the ability to manipulate one of the eight elements.
Most people cannot do this at all;
those who can have an average score of 10.

*  **Earth**: dirt and stone, but *not* metal.

*  **Air**: wind.

*  **Fire**: flames.

*  **Water**: including ice.

*  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.  (Nobody can stop time, or see the future.)

*  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.

*  **Truth**: knowledge.

*  **Dream**: dreams and feelings.

It is very rare for someone to be able to shape more than one element,
and no one can shape opposite elements:
Earth and Air,
Fire and Water,
Time and Luck,
Truth and Dream.

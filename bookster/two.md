The day started like any other.  Sunshine meant it was
morning. Morning meant Erileine had to get out of bed. She rubbed the
grit from her eyes and rolled over, luxuriating in a last few moments
of warmth.

The gumminess in her mouth told her that she had read past midnight
once again. The book responsible sat on the stool beside her
low-framed bed; the thumb-sized piece of dayglass that had been her
nightlight when she was little lay on top of it, still glowing faintly
with the remains of the previous day's sunlight.

She yawned and sat up, wrapping the quilt around her shoulders.
Vaszlav would arrive soon, if he wasn't already in his usual spot
outside Mamaere Mayeule's. Erileine groped under the quilt for her
pants and shirt on, then slipped the book she'd borrowed on the
peddler's previous visit into her satchel and went downstairs.

"Morning," her father Laeuc said.

"Morning," Erileine sreplied, yawning again. Her father had already
been up for hour or more carving fine curlicue details on the shaft of
a bamboo flute.

"You going to see Vaszlav?"

"Mm hm." Erileine eyed the heel of potato bread that lay forgotten on
a plate at her father's elbow. "Are you going to eat that?"

"No, go ahead." Laeuc scored a quarter circle in the flute, then held it
up and squinted at it critically. "Don't forget you have to finish the
fence today."

"I won't." Slipping the bread into his pocket, Erileine headed out the
front door.

She stood blinking for a moment in the sharp light of the mountain
morning. It was earlier than she'd thought---Slip Street was almost
empty.  She was tempted to go back to bed, or to sit and watch her
father carve, but then she heard a rooster crow from Armaend and
Donaien's yard.  Her mother would be up soon, and would undoubtedly be
able to find chores for an idle child. If her sister Queçenne was the
only one in the house...  She took a deep breath. Wood smoke, the tang
of pine, and a hint of spring---it was a fine day for her sister to do
chores.

Slip Street ran the length of Starboard Town, as crooked as a dropped
piece of string. It was paved from top to bottom with rounded gray
cobblestones, each as large as Erileine's two hands put together.
Weeding them was the bosun's favorite punishments for minor offenses,
which meant that Erileine had pulled up more burlicks and snowdelions
than most of Starboard Town's children, invariably muttering, "But I
didn't mean to," under her breath.

The houses crowded shoulder-to-shoulder on either side of the street
had steep roofs for the snows of northern winters and large shuttered
windows to let in the breeze during the hot southern summers. Their
whitewashed walls were spackled with brightly-painted doors, each
unique: orange and gray, blue and red, a diamond pattern of black on
gold. A man-tall door soldier made of wood and straw stood guard
beside each, each in a carefully-mended uniform whose colors matched
those of the door. Every storyteller on the mountain had a different
explanation for the custom; all anyone really knew was that they made
them because their grandparents had.

Above the narrow street flew the town's kites. The townspeople
launched them when the mountain left Mau Ngapcha, with wishes written
on their bamboo cross-struts. A few had already fallen, or been blown
away by storms, but most still dipped and swayed in the steady breeze
of the mountain's northward journey.

Erileine touched two fingers to her lips and pointed them at the blue,
orange, and yellow paper diamond holding station downwind from her
family's chimney. "Next year in Gandan," she whispered. Next year in
the greatest school in the world, surrounded by books and scholars, a
place where no one thought you were strange if you knew what
"loquacious" meant...

A cream-and-chocolate goat bleated at Erileine from a nearby rooftop,
then lowered its head to nibble the moss between its feet. Two
startled irvings fluttered away like leaves in a sudden hurricane,
returning a heartbeat later to peck at the goat's leavings. Hitching
her satchel's strap higher on her shoulder, she ambled up the street
to Mamaere Mayeule's.

Vaszlav was just starting to set up when Erileine arrived. "Clear day,
young *sra*," the old Hett tinker puffed, slipping his heavy pack off
his shoulders and touching his hairline respectfully.

"'Day, Vaszlav," Erileine replied. "Did you find the other Farberre
book?"

"Ah, that..." Vaszlav shrugged apologitically.  "I'm sorry, but the
fellow wouldn't lend it out.  Offered him half a quarter-ring, like
you said, and promised he'd get the full worth of it if there was so
much as a smudge on the back page, but he said it was the only copy he
had."

"Oh." Downcast, but also somewhat relieved that she wouldn't have to
spend a week's allowance on something she would probably read in a
single evening, Erileine leaned against Mamaere Mayeule's and watched
the old man ttake his pack's bamboo frame apart with a speed born of
long practice.

She turned at the sound of footsteps on the cobblestones to find a
second Hett had come up behind her. "Clear day," Erileine said
politely.

The Hett nodded. "And to you." He was younger than Vaszlav---perhaps
in his twenties, or early thirties. Where the older Hett was wiry, the
newcomer looked as sturdy as a cart ox, with the top two buttons of
his shirt undone, and a sleeveless vest over top of it instead of the
full coat that Vaszlav wore no matter what weather the mountain was
flying through. His curly hair and dark eyes were as unremarkable as
his homespun clothes, but there was a stillness about him that
unsettled Erileine.

Vaszlav cleared his throat. "This is Jaromir, my new apprentice.  And
this *sra* is Erileine Elaiene é Laeuc, the most voracious reader on
Avaunt."

The Hett nodded. It was definitely a nod, not Vaszlav's deferential dip
of the head. "Shall I set up here?" he asked the older Hett.

"Please." Vaszlav handed his apprentice two pieces of bamboo.  "Here.
Idiot things must have warped with the wet. See if you can sort them
out."

A small knot of people gathered while the two Hett put Vaszlav's stall
together and set out his wares, each explaining to the next who
Jaromir was. Bored, Erileine counted the cobblestones beneath her
feet. Two, four, six... eighteen, twenty---Slip Street was twenty
cobblestones wide. She frowned. How many there were on the whole
street?  Her papaere or the bookster would have thought it would be
fun to figure it out. Not the townspeople around her, though---they
would just roll their eyes and trade amused looks with each other.

Or worse. Her stomach sank as he saw Fraederiq and Niquolas coming
toward him. The three of htem had been friends when they were younger,
but then Fraederiq's mother had run off, intoxicated (some said) by
the whispered poetry of a Bantangui cinnamon merchant, and weary of
her husband's endless arguments. Now sixteen, Fraederiq hadn't just
grown taller and stronger: he'd grown angry too, angry at the whole
world. As always, Niquolas had followed suit, rolling up his sleeves
the way Fraederiq did, throwing stones when Fraederiq threw them, and
sneering at whatever stirred the older boy's displeasure that day.

As the only other child their age in Starboard Town, and with a head
full of odd facts, Erileine was resigned to being their favorite
target.  Lately, though, it had seemed as if Fraederiq was trying to
be nice to her. That worried Erileine more than the surreptitious
trippings and knucklings she'd grown used to. She slid behind Armaend
and Donaien, who were lost in one of their interminable discussions
about cooking, but it was too late.

"Day." Fraederiq's greeting was just a grunt.

"Day." Erileine stuck her hands in her pockets. The less she said...

Fraederiq jerked his chin at Vaszlav's stall. "Anything better than the
usual junk this time?"

Erileine shrugged.  "I dunno."

Fraederiq's eyes narrowed. "Who's he?" he asked, pointing at Jaromir.

"Vaszlav's apprentice."

"Huh. Another stupid newcomer. My paere says there's too many new Hett
on the mountain."

Erileine shrugged again. Fraederiq's father, Gaeston, said many
things, few of them kind.  She was saved from having to think of
another noncommittal answer by the ringing of Vaszlav's chime. "Clear
day, good morning, *mingala ba*," he said, as he always did. "Please,
good *sra*, how many I help you today?"

Erileine cast a quick eye over the odds and ends on display, seeing
nothing she hadn't seen before. As she turned to go, Fraederiq caught
her arm. She stiffened, waiting for a knuckle-twist in her ribs.
Instead, Fraederiq nodded brusquely at Vaszlav's shelves. "What do you
think of that barrette?" he asked.

"What?"

"That barrette," Fraederiq repeated impatiently. "Think it's any good?
My paere says a lot of what the Hett sell is junk.  I don't want to
waste good money on junk."

Bemused, Erileine looked at the little hair clip. It didn't look like
much of anything to her, just two fingers of polished wood held
together by a bent tin spring. "I guess it's all right to me."

"I think it's junk," Niquolas sneered.

Fraederiq silenced him with a look. "You think someone like Queçenne
would like it?"

Erileine blinked. "Um... I don't know," she said weakly.

Fraederiq scowled. "Come on. She's your sister, you ought to know."

Erileine shrugged helplessly. Sharing a house with Queçenne didn't
mean she knew how her sister *thought*. "I don't know," she
repeated. "Why don't you ask her?" *Or jump off the mountain,* she
added to herself.  The thought that Fraederiq might care what Queçenne
liked and didn't like was deeply unsettling.

"Pfah. You're useless." Fraederiq let go of her arm and slipped past
Armaend and Donaien, who were still arguing about the best way to chop
onions when making curry. "How much is that?" he asked Vaszlav,
pointing at the barrette.

"This?" Vaszlav handed it to Fraederiq. "It's quite the pretty, isn't
it? Thindi, not Bantangui---on my blood, that's real mahogany. I could
let you have it for three quarter rings."

"What? For this trash?" Fraederiq scowled. "It's not worth half that.
Here." He pulled a string of coins out of his pocket, untied it, and
held out a pair of quarter-ring coins. "I'll give you half a ring for
it, how's that?"

Vaszlav spread his hands helplessly. "I am sorry, *sra*, but I
cannot. I paid two quarters five pence for it myself, and---"

"What about goods in trade?" Niquolas interrupted. He elbowed
Fraederiq.  "We've been doing some carving, haven't we?  We figure
they'll fetch half a ring each. Give you three now, that's..." He
paused, his fingers moving against his trouser leg.

"A ring and a half," Erileine supplied automatically.

Before Vaszlav could reply, Jaromir spoke up.  "What kind of carvings
these are?"

Niquolas glanced around. "Heads," he said conspiratorially. "For door
soldiers. We're making them out of coconut shells. They're really
scary---still have all the hair on and everything. People are going to
pay a fortune for them, you'll see."

"That sounds interesting," Jaromir said, his tone saying more than his
words. "Perhaps we could take a look at some before making any
agreement?"

"Hells, keep the damned thing." Fraederiq tossed the barrette at
Vaszlav.

As quick as a cobra, Jaromir snatched it out of the air and put it
back in its place on the stall.

Erileine caught her breath.  What Fraederiq had done had been rude,
but what Jaromir had done had been a challenge, and Hett didn't
challenge Avauntois, not if they knew what was good for them.

She glanced at Fraederiq, expecting to see the glare she had been on
the receiving end of so many times herself. Instead, the corner of
Fraederiq's mouth had curled up. "Nice catch," he said.  Without
another word he turned and walked away, whistling.

Erileine's heart sank. She knew that whistle. It meant that Fraederiq
had a plan, and that was never good news.

* * *

Erileine spent the rest of the morning mending the bamboo fence that
kept the rabbits out of her family's vegetable garden.  When the
Hett's chimes sounded at noon to signal that his visit was over, she
hung her hammer on the fence and squeezed into the narrow gap between
her house and the one next to it.

The sweat on Erileine's face and arms chilled instantly in the cool
shadows. She inched toward Slip Street. If she stopped just *here*,
she could see Fraederiq's house without being seen herself.

Vaszlav and Jaromir trudged past with their packs on their backs. A
heartbeat later, the door Erileine was watching opened.  Fraederiq
stepped onto the street and set off after the two Hett.

"Great," Erileine muttered. Now what was she going to do? Tell the
bosun that she didn't like the look Fraederiq had on his face three
hours ago?  Wishing she could whisper in someone's ear from halfway
across the world like a magician, she followed Fraederiq.

At the top of Slip Street, the Hett turned right onto Forecastle Road.
Fifty strides behind them, Fraederiq hopped the fence into Papaere
Badette's bedraggled front garden. Erileine's heart sank. That was the
shortcut to the upper goast pasture---Fraederiq was definitely trying to
catch up with the Hett, out of sight of the rest of the town.

"Afternoon, young bookster. Shouldn't you be up at the captain's
house?" The booming voice made Erileine jump.

"Afternoon, bosun." She touched her fingers to his hairline in a
hurried salute. "I'm, um, I'm mending the fence."

The bosun raised his eyebrows. "Really? Looked to me like you were
standing in the middle of the street."

"Yes, bosun." Erileine swallowed. "It's just..." *Fraederiq will kill me,*
she thought bleakly. "It's just, I think there's a problem."

If Erileine hadn't sounded so miserable, the bosun wouldn't have
believed her.  After all, this was the girl who once claimed that
she'd been kidnapped by a pack of banana trolls.  But when Erileine
mentioned Jaromir catching the thrown barrette, the bosun
nodded. "Heard about that," he grunted. "Damn cheeky of him."

"Yes, *sra*," Erileine said, not sure whether the bosun was referring to
Fraederiq or Jaromir.

Bosun Uyves sucked on his front teeth for a moment. "Up to the goat
pasture, eh? All right. Let's go see what's happening."

"But---"

The bosun raised a finger. Just one, but it was enough. Erileine
closed her mouth with a snap. How did she get herself into these
things?

There was an even shorter shortcut to the pasture, one that involved
scrambling up a near-vertical rock face near the pit where the
villagers dumped the gleanings from their toilets. Once at the top,
the bosun reached down, grabbed Erileine's wrist, and pulled her up
like a sack of yams. He tapped his finger to his lips, then slipped
into the trees. Erileine followed helplessly.

The dense carpet of fallen needles underfoot muffled their steps.
Suddenly Erileine heard voices ahead.  "Actually, I'm saving you
money," Fraederiq said. "I mean, the fine would be what, two crowns?
Maybe three? Hells, the bosun might even shackle you for a
week. Giving me that piece of trash seems cheap by comparison, doesn't
it?"

Erileine and the bosun were close enough to hear Vaszlav clear his
throat. "If you put it that way..."

"No," Jaromir said firmly.

Erileine gingerly moved a branch out of her way.  Fraederiq was
standing in the middle of the road with his back to the bushes
Erileine and the bosun were hiding behind. The Hett were facing him,
their oversized packs on their shoulders. A frightened smile was fixed
on Vaszlav's face, but Jaromir's arms were crossed, and his expression
stony.

Fraederiq tsk'd. "Well then, I suppose there's nothing I can do except
go and tell the bosun."

"Tell me what?" Uyves asked, stepping onto the road. As Fraederiq
whirled around, Erileine saw Jaromir flick his hand to toss something
into the bushes beside him.

"Clear day, bosun," Vaszlav said nervously. "We, um, we were just---"

"Tell me what?" the bosun repeated, ignoring him.

Fraederiq jerked his thumb over his shoulder at Jaromir. "He's wearing a
homestone. I saw it when they were in town."

"Did you now?" Uyves' eyes never left Fraederiq's face. "Funny you
didn't mention it then."

Fraederiq shrugged. "I just wanted to be sure."

The bosun's hand shot out to grab Fraederiq's collar and yank him up
onto his toes.  "You want to be sure of something, be sure of this,"
the bosun growled into the struggling boy's ear.  "Taking fines is the
captain's business, and no one else's. I ever catch you doing it under
your own sail, you will be chopping wood until your hands
bleed. Understood?"

"Yes, *sra*," Fraederiq said sullenly, touching his finger to his
hairline.

The bosun pushed him away. "Good. Now be off with you."

"Yes, *sra*," he repeated.  As he turned to go, he shot Erileine a
look that was as cold as a dead snake's heart.

"So," the bosun said to the Hett. "What's this about a homestone?"

Jaromir shrugged without uncrossing his arms. "I am not wearing one,
*sra*."

"Mm hm." The bosun beckoned him forward. "Open your shirt."

Wordlessly, the Hett undid his vest, then his shirt, and held them open.
Other than a healthy crop of chest hair, there was nothing to see.

"So where is it?" the bosun asked.

Jaromir lowered his arms and began buttoning his shirt.

"I said, where is it?" the bosun repeated sharply.

Vaszlav wrung his hands. "*Sra*, if my apprentice---"

"Quiet, old man. I'm not talking to you." The bosun cracked a knuckle.
"Hells. All right, you're not wearing one, but I don't think the boy
would have made it up out of nothing. Half a crown, or ten days, take
your pick."

Vaszlav opened his mouth to protest, but Jaromir cut him off. "As you
say, bosun. May I pay in parts?"

"Just as long as I have it before we berth," Uyves replied.

The Hett dipped his head. "On my blood."

Uyves waited a heartbeak for the '*sra*' that should have followed. When
it didn't, he glanced at Vaszlav. "Pretty sure of himself, isn't he?"

The older Hett dipped his head nervously in apology. "He is still new
to the mountain, *sra*. He means no offense."

"Mm. Well, best be on your way."  Uyves turned to Erileine and clapped
her on the shoulder. "Good work, lass."

"Thanks," Erileine mumbled. She could already imagine Fraederiq's
hands around her throat...

With a final nod to Vaszlav, Uyves turned back toward Starboard
Town. As soon as he rounded the corner, Jaromir set his pack down and
and fished his homestone out of the bushes where he'd thrown it.

"Wonderful," Vaszlav said tiredly. "Perhaps you could have waited until
the young *sra* was not here?"

Jaromir glanced at Erileine as he hung the homestone around his neck. It
was a flat lozenge of polished granite, half again as tall as it was
wide, with a hole drilled near the top for a cord. Many of the Hett who
had come to the mountain the past few years wore them. For luck, for
good health, because it had been their grandmother's, because all the
other Hett were doing it---there were as many explanations as there were
stones, and as many complaints about the practice as there were
Avauntois who would rather not have any Hett on the mountain at all.

As a sop to the more outspoken among them, the captain had ordered a
handful of homestones tested for magic. When none was found, he banned
them anyway, ordering a fine for a first offense, and expulsion from the
mountain for a second. *And here I am looking at one*, Erileine thought.
She should have stuck to mending the fence.

"Don't worry," she said aloud to Vaszlav. "I won't say anything."

"Thank you, young *sra*," the Hett replied gratefully. "Now, if you
will excuse us? We will be two days to Forecastle with these packs."

"Sure. See you in two weeks." She raised a hand in farewell.

Suddenly aware that she was going to be late for her lesson at the
captain's house, Erileine walked quickly. She jumped as a macaw
squawked at her from a branch overhead, instantly angry at it for
making her heart pound.  Stooping, she picked up a stone and threw it
at the brightly colored bird. "Go home," she said loudly. The macaw
squawked again and flapped away, wondering in its little bird mind why
the trees smelled so strange and why the nights were so cold. A few
jungle creatures were always caught on the mountain when it left Mau
Ngapcha. Sometimes the townspeople caught them and sold them as pets
or delicacies at Gandan Berth. Better that than letting them starve or
freeze to death, they told one another.

Erileine heaved a sigh of relief when she reached Slip Street. People
were stringing beans and weeding potatoes in the terraced fields on
either side of town. He waved hello to the few who noticed her, but
didn't stop to chat.

The Captain's House watched over Starboard Town from the top of Slip
Street like a shepherd watching her flock. The old captain had still
been living there when Erileine was born. After his death, it had been
empty until Razi had arrived to catalog its eclectic collection of old
books and yellowing papers.

That morning, the walled garden in front of the house was a riot of
purple and orange flowers. Bees buzzed back and forth among them in
busy ecstasy. Erileine paused at its front gate---the only iron gate
in Starboard Town---to catch her breath. As she reached for the latch,
a meaty fist struck the side of her head.

She yelped, staggering under the blow. Strong hands grabbed her jacket
and pulled her into the shadowed alley next to the garden wall.

Erileine oophed as Fraederiq slammed her against the stone wall. "You
little slug," he hissed, his face so close that Erileine could feel
the moist warmth of his breath. "Who the hells do you think you are?
Eh? You think you're better than the rest of us because of all that
cake you read?"

"Let go of me!" Erileine struggled helplessly. Fraederiq jerked her
toward him and slammed her back into the wall.

"Didn't anyone ever tell you to mind your own business?" Fraederiq
twisted Erileine's collar tight with his left hand and punched her in
the ribs with his right. "Eh? Didn't anyone... ever... tell you...
not... to stick...  your nose... where it doesn't... belong?"  Fresh
blows punctuated the sentence.

"Let me go! Let me go or I'll tell!" Erileine threw a desperate punch of
her own. He was as surprised as Fraederiq when it grazed the older boy's
cheek.

Fraederiq caught Erileine's wrist and drove Erileine's hand into her own
face. "Ow! Oh, stop, Erileine! Stop, please, you'll hurt yourself!" Again
and again Fraederiq punched Erileine in the face with her own fist. Hot
tears stung Erileine's eyes. She opened his mouth to yell for help.

And without warning, the mountain lurched beneath them.

## Prolog

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight
thousand gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to
west.  Its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great
ocean, whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet
speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilot Angels, and nearly ended with
them as well.  Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a long
Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of
glass, and littered the land with strange magic.  When it was over the
Pilot Angels were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it
could.*

*Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above
the endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms and a girl is doing her
chores.  She is no longer a child but not yet an adult, and has no
idea that her world is about to change forever...*

## Chapter 1: Soldiers

Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale.
Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a
clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the
shadows of the twisted mountain pines.

"Shoo."  She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick.  It waved
its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a
new home.  Noxy cut its web's anchor threads with two practiced twists
of her knife and began winding it onto a stick.

"Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?" Sensy asked.

Noxy glanced at her.  "Why? Are those ones coming loose?"

"No." Sensy looked down at her soft brown goofskin coat critically.
"They're just kind of plain.  Granna Fee has some really nice red
ones.  She said she'd give them to me if I picked the stones out of
her pepper garden."

"Her whole garden? That would take forever." Noxy shook the dew off
the spider's web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over
her shoulder.  "Why would you do all that work for buttons you don't
need?"

"Oh, you're no help," Sensy pouted.  She had spent the winter
embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar.
All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes, and her
hair, and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't
possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale.  Especially
Rash---practically *anyone* would be more fun to be around than Rash.

"A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes," Granna Fee
had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who
seemed to have taken her best friend's place.

"Not me!" Noxy had declared.

Her grandmother had laughed.  "No, daffodil, not you."

Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted,
"Soldiers! Soldiers!"

"Oh, wonderful," she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy.  The whole
point of going out to collect spiderwebs that morning had been to get
*away* from the younger children for a few hours.

Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked
himself up and ran over to the two girls.  "There's soldiers in the
village!" he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve.  "And
they've been fighting!  And there's a *tiger* with them!"

"Sure," Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away.  "And there's a
dragon under your bed."  The mountains that lined the pass below Stale
were still covered in snow.  Avalanches happened almost every
day---someone would have to be foolish *and* desperate to be on the
road this early in the spring.

"But they're *real*!" Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to
another.  "They've got swords, and some of them are bleeding!  And the
tiger can *talk*!"

Noxy opened her mouth to say, "Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?"
but a deep *doom doom* cut her off.  She and Sensy looked at each
other wide-eyed.  *Doom doom*, pause.  *Doom doom*, pause.  It was
Stale's home drum.  It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had
wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed
help to find their way home.  It meant trouble.

Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch.  "Come on!" she told Sensy.

"I told you!" Young Gas shouted behind them. "Hey, wait for me!"

The path was one of dozens that wound through the evergreen forest
that surrounded Stale.  Mud made it slippery where it wasn't slick
with ice, but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the ridge above
the village.

She paused to catch her breath.  Below her lay the ancient walls of
the fortress of Stale.  Centuries of rain and snow had rounded the
edges off the Pilot Angels' stonework, making it look like a snow fort
that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as the
mountains themselves.  The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered
inside the walls like ducklings in a nest.  Thin licks of smoke rose
from their slate chimneys, while goof pens, vegetable plots, and racks
laden with drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.

To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.  A
net woven from squirrel spider thread was stretched over its top, as
light as a dream but as strong as steel.  Another net hung down at the
gorge's mouth to make a gate.  Inside, just visible from the ridge,
two gray clouds floated half-asleep.

Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds,
riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them.
Grownups said this pair were slow and lazy, but they were the most
exciting things in Noxy's world.  They, and the herd of half-wild
clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance, were the reason
Stale existed.

Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her.  "Wait!" her
friend hissed, pointing into the trees.  For a moment all Noxy saw was
branches.  Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and her mouth suddenly
went dry.

As she and Sensy started to back up, one slow step at a time, Little
Gas came pelting down the path behind them and ran straight into Noxy,
nearly knocking her off her feet.  "Whoa!" he exclaimed, "What's
happening?  Why did you---mmph!"

"Don't move!" Noxy whispered, her hand clamped over his mouth.
"Just... don't move."

Before Young Gas could protest, the hairy creature who had been
watching leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up into the
tree.  He paused for a moment to study the trio again, his fur more
gray than brown and his eyes old and sad, then disappeared into the
greenery.

Sensy was the first to speak.  "Wh-what's a troll doing *here*?" she
asked shakily.

Noxy shook her head.  "Worry about that later.  Come on!"

The drum had stopped booming by the time the three children reached
the gap in the wall where an enormous counterbalanced stone door had
hung centuries ago.  The wooden replacement that Stale's current human
inhabitants had put up in its place was as solid as they could make
it, but still looked like a child's toy next to the Pilot Angels'
ancient work.

Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the cobbled
square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who
had left a week ago for the snowfields to collect Stale's clouds from
their winter pasture.  Three hundred people, from babies in their
mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, stood in a half-circle on
one side of the square.  A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front
of them.  They wore steel helmets with yellow feathers on their
crests, and stiffened leather armor as thick as bootsoles that reached
from their shoulders to their waists.  Heavy wool kilts brushed
against the tops of their sturdy knee-high leather boots.  Each
soldier had a sword in a scabbard on his hip and a pack on his back.

And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting.  One man's hand
was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling.
None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard
faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.

But Noxy didn't see any of that right away.  What she saw instead was
the tiger.  His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes, not
orange and black like the picture in the book that three generations
of village children had passed around.  A pair of golden earrings hung
from his left ear, and his tail twitched slightly, as if the assembled
villagers reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.

A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack
as large as any of theirs.  When he turned his head, Noxy saw four
half-healed scars on his cheek, angry red against his near-black skin.
His back was straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was
because of the cold, weariness, fear, or all three, Noxy couldn't
tell.

Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve.  "Who *are* they?"

"Sh!" Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know.
"I'm trying to hear!"

Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and
stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the
square.  "Friends," she said in a loud voice, patting the air with her
hands to quiet the villagers.  "Friends, please.  Thank you all for
coming.  I know it is early in the year for travellers, but please,
bid welcome to Sergeant Dorbu, of the Angry Canary troop."  The
soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers.

"And to the Gifted Kulbinder, also of the Angry Canaries," Indy
continued, gesturing toward the tiger.  "They and their companions
will be our guests for the next little while."

"How long's a little while?" Aft asked loudly.  Noxy winced.  Aft had
stayed in the village instead of going to round up other adults
because his wife was expecting a baby.  He was the best cloudherd in
the village, at least in his own estimation, but had the manners of a
constipated goof.

"Until they are ready to travel again," Indy reassured him.  Her eyes
swept across the crowd.  "Their journey has been a hard one---they
hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans.
Sergeant?  Would you like to say a few words?"

The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as
Indy stepped down.  Like the rest of the soldiers, his skin was black
compared to the villagers' dark brown, and his wiry hair was trimmed
to a thin fuzz.  Two yellow ribbons, exactly the same color as the
feathers in his helmet, ringed his left sleeve.

He smiled at the villagers and opened his mouth to speak, but Aft
spoke again before he could get a word out.  "You lot loyalists?"  the
cloudherd asked loudly.

"Give the man a chance to speak!" Grappa Gas said just as loudly,
rapping his cane against his wooden leg.  He and his son glared at
each other.

"You two behave," Granna Fee scolded them.  Noxy's grandmother was a
head shorter than either of the men, but the iron in her voice quieted
them both down.  She nodded at the sergeant.  "Go ahead, young man."

"Um, thank you, respected" the soldier said gratefully.  "And thank
you, people of Stale.  As your mayor said, my comrades and I were
trying to see if the pass to Chaghan was clear yet.  We---" He paused
for a moment before continuing.  "We were attacked three days ago and
driven off the road into the forest.  Everything seemed all right at
first, but then the forest must have spoken to the trolls and..."  He
shrugged.  "Well, you can probably guess what happened next."

Voices murmured.  The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso Mountains from
wheat fields of Uws in the south to Garheim's frigid shores in the
north and the Ninety Kingdoms in the west.  It wasn't as cruel as the
Jungle of Thind, but it guarded its territory and privileges as
jealously as a bear guarded her cubs.  Gifted creatures that wanted to
live in the forest had to do her bidding.  And humans were not welcome
inside its borders at all, not unless they stuck to the handful of
roads built long ago by the Pilot Angels.  Travellers who strayed were
rarely given warnings, and *never* given second chances.

A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he
continued.  "We finally made it back to the road, but the worst of our
hurt couldn't keep going, so we left them in camp with a few of the
able-bodied and came here looking for help.  They won't be able to
keep the trolls at bay for long."

Aft broke the silence that followed.  "So which side of the fight
*are* you on?" he asked, his voice still belligerent but three notches
less rude than it had been.

"I have the privilege of serving Her Highness, Princess Shudarga,"
Sergeant Dorbu said calmly.

"Rebels..." breathed a voice behind Noxy.  She and Sensy jumped and
spun around.  Rash had sidled up behind the two girls, but instead of
poking them in the ribs as he usually would, he had been listening to
the soldiers.

"Goof," Sensy muttered, punching his arm before turning her back on
him.  Rash grinned at Noxy, who scowled in return and pointedly turned
her back on him as well.

"Does that mean King Denpa's boys are going to come calling after
you?"  Grappa Gas demanded, waving down his son before Aft could speak
again.  As with everything else, they had chosen opposite sides when
Princess Shudarga raised her flag the previous summer.  "Because if
they do, these walls won't keep 'em out for long, and neither will
we."

The smile slipped from the sergeant's face.  Noxy suddenly saw how
weary he was.  "We didn't choose Stale for its walls, respected.  We
didn't choose it at all.  We just washed up here because we couldn't
go any further.  Our friends need help.  If you're afraid that'll
bring trouble, we'll understand if you send us on our way."

"Nobody is turning anyone away," Indy said firmly.  "We mountain folk
take pride in our hospitality.  We may not have much, but I'm sure we
can find some spare blankets to keep you warm and stretch our stores
enough to feed you for a few days."

"Thank you, respected," the sergeant said, bowing again.  "But what we
really want right now is a couple of clouds so we can go and rescue
our friends."

## Chapter 2: Not Quite What We Were Expecting

The next five minutes were chaos.  Out of the question, Grappa Gas
said, whacking his wooden leg with his cane to emphasize his points.
The law might forgive them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who
wandered in out of the cold, even if they were rebels, but flying off
to rescue their friends?  Why, when the *tralpa* came back---

---they'd show him the gate and send him on his way, Aft cut in, arms
crossed and brows knotted.  The lazy good-for-nothing had run for the
capital the day word of the rebellion had reached the mountains, and
hadn't been seen since.  As far as Aft was concerned, he'd given up
any right he might once have had to rent laws to anyone.  Anyway, if
they were going to shelter rebels, the king wouldn't care if they'd
come to Stale or Stale had gone to them.  And anyway again, what would
other cloudherds say if they heard that Stalers had left men in the
forest to die?  Angels' names, what would their own folk say when they
got back from up the mountain?

The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones.  Little
whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart
as people overheard neighbors they disagreed with, or turned around to
agree with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet
another "but what if?"

"This is going to go on forever," Noxy said sourly.  "They all know
they're going to do whatever my *amma* want to do in the end---why
don't they just get on with it?"  She, Sensy, and Rash had stayed
aloof on the sidelines, old enough that they hadn't grown bored and
run off with Young Gas and the other children, but young enough that
the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.

Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a
mustache.  It had become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had
told him countless times he ought to break before *someone* broke his
stupid finger.  "What I want to know is whether we're going to get to
go, or if we're going to be stuck here with the littles.  Again."

"Of course we'll get to go!" Noxy exclaimed.

"Are you sure?"  Rash raised an eyebrow, another annoying trick he had
developed while his broken leg had been healing through the winter.

Noxy puffed an annoyed breath, biting off her "of course I'm sure!"
when she caught Sensy's uncertain look.  "Wait here," she said with a
scowl.

She strode toward the center of the square, slowing as she neared the
speaker's stone.  Her mother was speaking intently with the sergeant.
The tiger sat impassively on his haunches next to them, his tail
twitching occasionally.  The boy with the scarred face still stood
beside him, his pack on the ground.  He looked like he was beyond
exhausted, but when his eyelids started to droop, the tiger growled
quietly and he snapped to attention again.

Noxy's mother caught sight of her.  "Oh, and this is my daughter,
Probably Noxious."

"Respected Noxious."  The sergeant bowed slightly.

Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was
immediately annoyed at herself.  Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a
silly lowlander custom.  "Just call me Noxy," she told him.  "*Amma*,
which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on?  We can go and start
getting them ready while everyone's still jawing."

Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well.  "Who said
anything about you three going?"

But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and
had assembled her arguments as she crossed the square.  They were
definitely old enough---why, they were all going to be riding *real*
clouds in a few weeks, not just tame old pair floating about in the
cloud pen.  And they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down
the pass, and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do
rescues, wasn't it?  And---

"Stop."  Her mother held up a hand, not noticing or just ignoring the
grin that had quirked the corner of Sergeant Dorbu's mouth.  "You can
go.  But!" she continued, "But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna
Fee, and that's all you do---ride.  Understood?"

Noxy nodded obediently.  "Yes, *amma*."  She had learned the hard way
not to keep asking for a whole orange when she'd already talked her
mother into a half.

It only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed.
Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and more than
one tinker or trader had needed to be lifted out of a difficult spot
after running into a bear or being set upon by trolls.  Coils of hemp
rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the
cloud pen, and everyone kept an extra goofskin cap somewhere handy,
just in case.

"You look ridiculous," Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the
wooden steps to the mounting platform.  He had been learning to
embroider during that winter's enforced idleness, and had stitched
what he claimed were eagle's wings onto the side flaps of his cap.

Rash looked her up and down.  "Really?  Because I think you look
amazing.  Excuse me."  He winked at Noxy and stepped around the
speechless 13-year-old to take his place on the platform.

"Ears all!" Aft called out, clapping his hands.  Despite the cold, he
was only wearing a sleeveless goofskin vest, knee-length wool shorts,
and a sturdy pair of boots.  His hair was pulled back in a thick club
braid, a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven into it for
luck.  "You know how this is done.  I'm fore on Big Blue, Gas and Fee
will have Pillow for spotter.  We'll down, lift, and out, quick and
simple, and get our new friends back here for soup before you can
sneeze.  No adventures, right?"  He turned a steely glare toward Noxy,
Sensy, and Rash, who nodded and mumbled, "No adventures."

"Right!"  And without anything more than that he walked out to the end
of the plank that stuck out three strides from the platform, looked
down to check that Big Blue was below him, and jumped.

Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath.  One, two,
three... Big Blue dimpled under Aft's weight as the burly cloudherd
hit him dead center.  Gray waves rippled out across the cloud's back
as Aft rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly.
Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in
concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount, rousing it from its
winter half-sleep.

Something twinged in the back of her head.  She blinked, momentarily
disoriented.  "Did you say something?" she asked Sensy.

"What?"  She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.

"I said---never mind."  Noxy shook her head.  "Look, he's coming up."

Big Blue rose slowly toward the platform, bunching up into a firmer
mass as he came.  Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the
cloud's back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.  A
silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, cawing its
displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away.

Aft looked up and smiled the smile he only ever wore when he was on
cloudback or had his arm around his wife.  "You want me to get Pillow
for you?" he called up to his father.

"No need, I can---damn that boy!"  Grappa Gas harrumphed as Aft took
three long steps across Big Blue's back and launched himself into the
air again.

Rash whistled.  "Nice leap," he said appreciatively as Aft landed
right in the middle of Pillow.  "And blind, too."

"It's not such a trick," Noxy said dismissively, though she was
secretly impressed.  "He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she
was."

"Sure, but would you trust a cloud's directions that much?"  Rash
challenged her.  "Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out
of what they say."

Noxy shrugged.  She had realized early in their training that
mind-talking was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash,
or even for some of the olders who were already riding.  She had
stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing
off.  The only person she shared her progress with now was Granna Fee,
and even she didn't---

*Twinge.* She winced and put her hand on the back of her head.  There
it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?

This time Sensy noticed.  "Are you all right?"

"Sure," Noxy lied.  One of the few things Aft and Grappa Gas agreed on
was that cloudherds shouldn't fly if they were sick, but she wasn't
going to admit anything that might mean being left behind.  "Come on,
let's go."

Grappa Gas made everyone wait until Big Blue was only a couple of
strides below the mounting platform before he let them jump on.  The
three teenagers had been doing it since they were little children, but
the brief moment of flight and *poof!* as they landed still made them
all whoop.  Grappa Gas landed beside them a moment later, and Granna
Fee a moment after that.  "Oof," she grunted, rolling over and sitting
up.  "That's not as soft as it used to be."  But then she smiled like
the girl she had once been and put her arm around Noxy so that her
granddaughter could lean against her the way she had so many times
before.

Behind them, Rash nudged Sensy with his elbow.  "You can lean on me if
you get cold, you know."

Sensy sniffed.  "I don't expect I'll ever get *that* cold."

Granna Fee pressed her hand against Big Blue and closed her eyes.  The
cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the spiderweb gate
that hung down over mouth of the gorge.  As he moved away from the
platform, Pillow rose to take his place.  Two of Stale's other
oldsters clambered aboard, too stiff or serious to jump.

"I'll take lead," Aft called.

"Yes, I heard you the first time," Granna Fee muttered under her
breath.  She slowed Big Blue so that Pillow could pass.  As she did
so, Aft took the ox horn from his belt and blew three loud notes, low
high low.

Indy blew an answering note from her seat above the cloud pen gate.
"Now comes the hard part," she told Sergeant Dorbu.  He, the tiger,
and the tiger's boy had come with her to see off the rescue party.
Instead of taking them with the others, she had led them up a steep
flight of stairs cut into the rock to a smaller square platform, where
she had seated herself on a sturdy little stool supported by a single
post.  As the clouds approached the gate, she put her feet on the
pedals that stuck out of the post and began pumping.

With a long squeak of protest, the spiderweb gate drew back so that
the clouds could get by.  "Saves us having to re-frib the curtain
every time someone comes in or out," she puffed.  "And it's half the
time."  She paused to wave Pillow and Big Blue's riders as they
drifted out of the pen and turned upwind.

"But twice the work, I'm guessing," Sergeant Dorbu said
sympathetically.  "Want me to wind it back?"

"What?  Oh, no, that's all right."  Indy started pedalling again.
"The exercise keeps me fit."

"Mm," the sergeant said, eyeing her.  When the tiger rumbled deep in
his throat, Sergeant Dorbu put on his most innocent expression.  The
tiger's boy just rolled his eyes.

Cloudherding is cold work, even in the summer.  In the spring, in the
mountains, when breath still fogs and the wind pokes its fingers
through every loose seam and down every collar, it's beyond freezing.
A hundred heartbeats after they left the cloud pen, Granna Fee had
wrapped a fleece around herself and her granddaughter, leaving only
their faces exposed.  Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy
said, he might be a goof, but at least he was a *warm* goof.

Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected.  "Saints and their inventions, but
I miss this," he sighed.  He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden
leg on so that it wouldn't poke into Big Blue, but was dressed in the
same long coat and scarf that he had been wearing when the soldiers
arrived.  "Look, the condors are back in their nest!  We should invite
them them to visit some time."

"They're not really the most sociable of creatures," Granna Fee said
dryly.

Grappa Gas harrumphed.  "You just have to get to know them.  I wonder
if any of their chicks will be Gifted this year?  That would be a
thing, wouldn't it?  Oh, and down there, is that---saints, is that a
person down there?"

"Where?"  Noxy pushed the heavy fleece aside and scrambled to the
cloud's leading edge.  "I don't see, where?"

Grappa Gas shook his head.  "Sorry, girl, it was just a troll."  He
patted her shoulder.

"Someone needs to remember to wear his glasses when he's out and
about," Granna Fee sniffed pointedly.  Grappa Gas harrumphed again,
but didn't reply.

It had taken Sergeant Dorbu and his men a day to hike up the pass to
Stale Leftovers.  The Staler cloudherds covered the same distance in
less than half an hour, even with the headwind.  "There," Granna Fee
said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.

Grappa Gas frowned.  "I thought he said there were just a few of
them."

Granna Fee frowned too.  "Maybe 'a few' means something different to
lowlanders."

The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that
rose like an island out of the forest.  Two dozen drab gray tents
huddled around a small fire.  Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw
a handful of men moving about, some propped against one another to
stay upright.

Grappa Gas gave a low whistle.  "Aft's not going to like this," he
said.

"Neither is my daughter," Granna Fee replied, shaking her head.

One of the injured soldiers spotted the clouds a few minutes later.
The cloudherds were too far away to hear his shouts, but there was no
mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms.  Other soldiers
crawled out of their tents and began waving and shouting as well as
Aft steered Pillow in a long arc to the upwind side of the rocky
outcrop.  After a brief discussion that mostly consisted of
interrupting each other, Granna Fee and Grappa Gas had Big Blue hover
directly above the camp.

"You lot keep your eyes wide," Grappa Gas ordered the teenagers
curtly.  "Forest might be happy to have us take them, or it might
not."

Pillow descended until she bumped against the northern edge of the
rock, her upper side level with its top.  The two older cloudherds
riding with Aft stayed on board while he strode forward, barking
orders to hurry the soldiers along.  Only a few wind-borne words
reached Noxy, but that was enough for her to know that he was telling
the injured men to leave their gear, to leave their tents, to leave
everything they couldn't pick up *right away*.

Limping and stumbling in singles and pairs, the men began to clamber
onto Pillow's back.  The older cloudherds helped the worst injured,
and had others move apart to keep their weight balanced.  As they were
doing this, one of the soldiers stopped in front of Aft and began to
argue, pointing at a larger tent set up a short distance away from the
others.  Other soldiers joined in, until Aft was partly surrounded by
a half-circle of angry men.

Finally he threw up his hands in surrender.  Taking the horn from his
belt, he blew two long notes, then windmilled his arm and pointed to
Pillow.

"No no no," Grappa Gas muttered.  "You can take them all, lad, just
get them loaded up and get out of there."

"What?  What's happening?" Noxy asked.

"He wants us to come in behind him and take some of them," Grappa Gas
told her angrily.  "But look---over there!"

Something brown flashed between two trees a dozen strides into the
forest.  Something else---something much larger---briefly let itself
be seen a few strides further away.  In singles and pairs and packs,
the forest was mustering its servants.

Grappa Gas spat over Big Blue's side.  "Forest is holding back for
now," he said.  "But we go in, it'll be on us like an avalanche."

"It's not your decision to make," Granna Fee told him.  "Aft's riding
fore on this one, and---"

"---and you follow your fore.  I know, I know.  Saints."  Grappa Gas
looked like he wanted to spit again, but instead he placed his palm on
Big Blue and closed his eyes.  A moment later the cloud began to
descend.

Granna Fee looked at the three teenagers.  "You shout as soon as you
see anything, you hear me?"

"Yes, granna," Sensy said as Rash and Noxy nodded.

Five heartbeats, ten... They were level with the camp.  Grappa Gas
steered them slowly across the wind toward Pillow's side.  The
soldiers watched them approach without expression, too weak and weary
to be amazed at the sight.  "Hurry it up!" Aft bellowed at the half
dozen who had dragged long canvas-wrapped packages out of the large
tent and were staggering back through camp with them over their
shoulders.  He leaped onto Pillow.  A moment later the cloud lifted
off, clearing space for Big Blue.

The larger cloud touched down with a bump.  An instant later something
roared in the forest behind them.  Noxy jumped.  Sensy shrieked and
Grappa Gas cursed as a brown bear charged out of the trees and halted
a stone's throw away.  It reared up on its hind legs and roared again.
Another bear joined it, then a cougar, and then---

"Oh no," Noxy breathed.  There were trolls in the trees, a dozen, two,
three, a whole troop of them.  They began hooting, shaking the
branches around them until it looked like the entire forest had come
alive.

The first of the soldiers reached them.  He stumbled at the edge of
the rocky outcrop and fell forward onto Big Blue, the package on his
shoulder landing heavily beside him.  The others were right behind
him.  "Come on come on come *on*!" Grappa Gas urged them.

A stone flew through the air, then another.  Suddenly the air was full
of flying rocks.  A soldier staggered and went down as one hit his
head.  Another struck Noxy hard in the back.  She ducked and covered
her head.

"Hang on!" Grappa Gas shouted.  Big Blue surged upward so suddenly
that Noxy was knocked off her feet.

"Look out!" Rash yelled, grabbing Sensy's arm and pulling her back as
the cougar leaped up at them.  The two teens fell together in a heap
on the cloud.  The cougar snarled with disappointment as it missed the
edge of the cloud by a palm's width.

Higher, higher... Noxy let out her breath, only then realizing that
she'd been holding it.  "That was close," she said shakily.

"Too close.  Too *damned* close!"  Grappa Gas rounded on the nearest
soldier.  "We could have been dinner, all of us, and for what?  What
was so aching important you just couldn't leave it behind!?"  He poked
at the long bundle beside the soldier with his cane.

The soldier looked at him bleakly.  "Our mates.  Those as didn't make
it.  We promised we'd give 'em a decent send-off."

Grappa Gas froze, then lowered his cane.  "Ah.  Sorry, lad.  I'm
sorry."

The soldier nodded.  "Me too."  Behind them, the forest's creatures
had already started tearing every man-made thing in the camp to
pieces.

## Chapter 3: Arguments and Pursuit

They hardly said a word on the way back to Stale.  One of the soldiers
even fell asleep, snoring on one of his companions' shoulders.  The
others watched the mountains go by with only an occasional flicker of
interest.

With her hand on Big Blue's back, Noxy could feel how unhappy the
cloud was.  It wasn't just that he was carrying strangers, or that
those strangers were bleeding and miserable.  When clouds died, they
just spread out into nothing.  The thought that something could end
but still be there---that it could go from being alive to being like a
rock or a log---made the five canvas-wrapped bodies frightening in a
way that storm winds and lightning couldn't match.

*Sh, sh, sh,* Noxy mind-spoke soothingly, stroking the cloud as if he
was an overgrown house cat.  *Home soon, then rest.* At that moment,
she wanted it just as much as the skittish cloud.

Aft brought Pillow down in a clearing in front of the village's main
gate.  It hadn't been cut back since the previous autumn, but only a
few ferns and flowers stuck up out of the rocky soil.  The soldiers he
had picked up slid off the cloud in ones and twos.  Some managed to
keep their feet under themselves, but others stumbled onto one knee or
landed on their backsides.  Under normal circumstances, the villagers
would have made jokes or applauded particularly clumsy dismounts.
There was no joking this time, though.  Instead, people came forward
to offer them men blankets and fleeces, or helped them stand and then
stepped back, unsure what to do next.

Indy didn't let the Stalers stand idle for long---she never did.  "Get
these ones up to the traders' hall," she ordered one group crisply.
"And get a couple of pots of stew going---and some tea.  You do drink
tea, don't you?"  She moved on without waiting for an answer.

Sergeant Dorbu was there as well.  He had traded his helmet for a
knitted cap, black with a pair of yellow stripes to match those on his
sleeves, but still wore his armor.  He clapped one man on the
shoulder, steadied a second leaning on a makeshift crutch, and bowed
his head when a third told him who hadn't made it through the night.

"Where's the tiger?" Rash asked, shading his eyes with his hand.

"Up on the wall," Sensy said, pointing.

Noxy shaded her own eyes.  Kulbinder was sitting on his hindquarters
high above the crowd with his boy beside him.  Suddenly the tiger
raised his head and looked straight at them---straight at *her*.  She
shivered with more than just the cold.

As the last soldier exchanged a salute with Sergeant Dorbu, Aft blew a
long note on his signal horn.  Pillow lifted off a moment later and
turned toward the cloud pen.

"Back up, you lot," Grappa Gas ordered.  "I'm going to bring this one
down."  He gave the three teenagers a moment, then closed his eyes and
ordered Big Blue down.

They bumped once as they landed.  "Whoops," Grappa Gas muttered,
coloring slightly at the look Granna Fee gave him.  "All right.  What
do you say we get this done and go find something warm to drink?"

It took a few moments for the soldiers to slide the bodies they had
brought down the cloud's flank into their waiting comrades' arms.
When a couple of villagers offered to help, Sergeant Dorbu shook his
head politely but firmly.  "These are ours," he said firmly.  "Though
we'd be grateful if you could gather some wood for a pyre---we'd like
to send them off tonight."

And then suddenly it was over.  Noxy found herself standing next to
her friends, both feet on the ground, watching Grappa Gas and Granna
Fee lift off to take Big Blue back to the cloud pen.  A handful of
Stalers were milling about, but the soldiers and everyone else was
already back inside the walls.  Even the tiger and his boy had
disappeared off the wall.

"Well," Noxy said awkwardly, not sure what to do next.  "I guess I'll
go see if my *amma* has any chores for me."

"If she doesn't, you can do some of mine," Rash replied, as he had a
hundred times before.  He glanced at Sensy.  "I guess we should to be
useful too."

"I guess," she said casually.  "See you later."

"You too."  Whatever else Noxy might have said was cut off by a
now-familiar twinge in the back of her head.  A heartbeat later she
head the staccato blatting of Aft's horn, the quick, angry pattern
that meant 'back away and give me some room'.  She caught her breath.
She had *known* one of the clouds was upset even before she'd heard
the horn---but how?

Her mother was still organizing people in the square.  Yes, the
soldiers would stay in the trading hall, she'd already said that.
Yes, the wounded---where else would they go?  And yes, there *were* a
lot more than 'a few' of them, but there was nothing they could do
about that now.

Indy caught sight of her daughter.  "It will have to wait, daffodil,"
she said as Noxy opened her mouth.  "Right now I want you to go home
and make some tea.  Use the big pot, and all the honey we have left.
I have the feeling we're going to have lots of visitors..."

The water hadn't even boiled before Grappa Gas showed up.  He rapped
on the door with his cane and entered without waiting for a hello.
"Hey, lass.  Where's your mother?"

"She should be back soon," Noxy said.  She added a handful of tea
leaves to the cinnamon bark and green cardamom pods already in the
pot.  It was an extravagance---the pack traders who brought such
delicacies to the village wouldn't start visiting until the last of
the snow had melted, which was at least another month away---but
Granna Fee had always said that a good cup of tea was worth a thousand
words.

"Mind if I sit?" Grappa Gas settled himself on a stool that was at
least as old as he was and watched Noxy drizzle the last of the honey
into the pot.

"What did you find out?" Noxy asked after a moment.

The old man snorted.  "Just like your mother, aren't you? And your
granna, too.  Always thinking one step ahead of everyone else." He
smiled.  "You know, if your granna hadn't been so smart, I might've
wound up being your grappa.  I remember once when---"

"Grappa!" Noxy cut him off, exasperated and amused at the same time.
"Tell me what the soldiers said!"

"And how do you know they said anything?" Grappa Gas challenged her.

"Because they're a long way from home, and tired, and sore, and want
us all to like them," Indy answered, closing the front door behind her
as she came in.  "And because I saw you duck into the trading hall on
your way down from the cloud pen.  Now, what did you find out?" She
kissed the old man on his grizzled cheek and sat on the other stool.

For a moment all Grappa Gas could think of was how alike mother and
daughter were.  Noxy's hair might be brown and wavy instead of
straight and black, and her face square instead of round, but they had
the same quick minds.  When Indy had turned ten, he had predicted that
she would be mayor before she was thirty.  *Better start telling
everyone that Noxy's going to take the job too,* he thought.

"The king's men hit them while they were crossing the ford near Tastes
Like Duck Droppings," he told Indy.  "Just bad luck, but they were
split between the two sides of the river when they were attacked."
His face darkened.  "Fellow I spoke to said the king's troops must
have had a magician with them, because their tiger didn't catch wind
of them until it was too late.  He doesn't expect expect he'll see
many of his friends again."

Indy glanced at Noxy.  "This doesn't go out of this house," she
warned.  Noxy nodded, turning to the stove as the lid on the kettle
began to whistle.  She lifted it carefully with a pair of sticks to
pour the boiling water into the tea, then replaced it on the stove and
set the teapot on the table to steep.

"Was there anything else?" Indy asked.

Grappa Gas frowned.  "They didn't say it, but King Denpa's winning.
And about time, too---he's got help now from half his neighbors, all
worried that Shudarga's craziness might be contagious.  If you ask
me---"

The front door banged open.  Aft strode in and glared at Indy.  "How
soon are they leaving?" he demanded.

"Well, good day to you too," Grappa Gas muttered.

Aft ignored his father.  "How soon, Indy? You know you can't let them
stay."

Indy stood up slowly.  "Make yourself comfortable," she said,
gesturing at her stool.  "Noxy, go get the peeling stool from out
back.  Brush it off before you bring it in the house."

Aft glowered at Indy a moment longer, then sat down opposite his
father.  The short stool creaked in protest under his weight.  Noxy
set down the peeling stool she had fetched for her mother, then began
pouring tea as inconspicuously as she could while Aft counted off the
reasons the rebels couldn't stay.  What if the king sent an army after
them? Wait, what did he mean "if", of course he would.  There were
only three hundred people in Stale, and only half a dozen of them had
ever held a sword.  Not that they *had* any swords.  And even if they
had---

"I'm surprised to hear you say all this," Indy interrupted.  "I
thought if anyone would take their side, it would be you."

"Well, yes, of course I do," Aft blustered.  "The sooner leeches like
the *tralpa* have to start earning an honest living like the rest of
us, the better.  But---"

"But it's different when someone's actually on your doorstep, isn't
it?"  Grappa Gas shook his head pityingly.

Aft clenched his hands into fists.  "Of course it's different.  The
baby could come any day now.  If the king's men come looking for this
lot--- if there's a fight---"

"Enough!"  Indy slapped the table with her hand.  "Enough, both of
you.  We have a stormload of trouble to fly through, and I will *not*
have you two making it worse with your bickering."

Noxy set a steaming mug of tea in front of her and two others in front
of Grappa Gas and his son.  Indy stared into hers as if hoping the
tiny swirling leaves might spell out some answers.  "I know it's a big
thing," she went on quietly.  "And I did think about turning them
away, but look at them.  They look like they've been through the
Blight.  If a storm caught them in the pass, they wouldn't even make
it as far as Makes Your Breath Rancid.  How would that make us look?"

Aft scowled.  "What people think won't matter much if we've all had
our throats cut.  No, wait, hear me out."  He slurped his tea and set
the cup down with a clatter.  "What we just did, saving travellers who
got caught on the mountain, we can explain that if we have to.  But
letting them stay here---saints and all their gifts, Indy, we can't.
We just can't.  It wouldn't be safe."

"For once, I agree with you."  Grappa Gas slurped his own tea with a
scowl.  "Never mind the trouble it'll bring when the king wins---yes,
I said *when*, and you know as well as I do that's what's going to
happen---never mind the trouble, it's three dozen mouths to feed when
we're already down to dried apples and barley."

Aft snorted.  "Never mind the tiger.  What are we supposed to feed it?
Or should I ask 'who'?"

"Disgusting Aftertaste!" Indy snapped.  "I will *not* have that kind
of talk about one of the Gifted.  Especially not in front of my
daughter."

"Hmph!" Aft snorted.  "All I can say is, let's hope there isn't a late
storm, because if there is, *I'm* going to be keeping *my* family
behind a good strong door." He swallowed the rest of his tea in one
gulp, stood, and nodded a curt goodbye to Noxy, and slammed the door
as he left.

"Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if you were right!" Grappa Gas
called out.  "Maybe we'd have some peace and quiet around here if a
few of us *did* get eaten!"  He turned back to Indy.  "Don't worry
about him---he's just worried about the baby."

"I know," Indy smiled.  "But I appreciate you saying it."

Grappa Gas drained the last of his tea in one long gulp.  "It's good,"
he said to Noxy.  "Maybe wants more cinnamon next time, though."

"I'll try to remember," Noxy promised.

Indy stood when Grappa Gas did.  "Will you stay for dinner?"

He shook his head.  "Thanks, girl, but I promised your mother I'd help
her, um, peel some potatoes."  He winked, ignoring Noxy's little 'eww'
of disgust.  Indy smiled and kissed him on the cheek again.  He was
humming as he left.

Noxy waited until her mother said down again before saying,
"*Amma*...?"

"Yes, daffodil?"

Noxy hesitated.  She didn't know where to start.  "Do you think the
king really is going to come looking for them?"

Indy sighed.  "I hope not.  But what I really hope is that they aren't
here long enough for us to have to worry about that."

When Princess Shudarga had marched on the capital the previous summer,
Grappa Gas had demanded that the cloudherds do their best to drown her
troops.  Aft had argued just as loudly that they should support the
rebellion.  After all, what had the king's *tralpa* done for them
except take half of what they brought home at the end of every summer
and tell them they couldn't build a bigger fishpond?  As the arguments
grew more heated, Indy had put on her collar, called everyone
together, and laid down the law.  This was the lowlanders' fight. The
people of Stale Leftovers were *not* going to take either side, not
while she was mayor, and if anyone didn't like it, they could have an
election right then and there to sort it out.  Anyone?  No?  All
right, then, why didn't everyone get back to their chores, because
they weren't going to do themselves.

The two sat in silence for a moment.  Finally Indy stretched.  "So
tell me, did you collect some spiderwebs, or did you and Sensy spend
the whole day mooning after Rash?"

"*Amma*! And how can you think about spiderwebs on a day like this?
And anyway, Sensy's the one who's mooning after Rash and that stupid
moustache he's trying to grow.  *I* think it's dumb."

"If you say so."  Indy raised her arms and stretched.  "Now, what are
we---"

*Crash!* Mother and daughter jumped as something landed on the roof
above their heads, sending tiles skittering down to shatter on the
cobblestones outside.  A low, menacing yowl sent ice up Noxy's spine.

"What in the names...?"  Indy crossed the floor in three steps and
threw open the door just in time to see a troll land in the narrow
street in front of their house.  She yelped and flung herself to the
side as the hairy creature lunged past her and raced up the stairs on
all fours.

The tiger hit the cobblestones a heartbeat later.  "Which way did it
go?" he demanded, his ears back and his tail lashing.

The sound of a window shutter being flung open upstairs answered his
question before Indy could.  "Wait, stop!"  She held up a hand before
the tiger could move.  "What in the saints' names are you *doing*?"

"He was spying on us!" the tiger snarled.  "Now let me pass!"

"No!"  As the tiger came forward, Indy stepped into the doorway to
block him.

He pulled up short with a snarl.  "I said *let me pass!*"

"And I said *no!*" The mayor of Stale glared at the cat, her eyes
flashing with the same angry light that lit his.  "This is *our*
village, and you will *not* race around like a madman unless *I* say
so, is that clear?"

It was the bravest thing Noxy had ever seen her mother do, and for one
long moment, she was sure it would be the last.  The muscles in the
tiger's shoulders bunched.  He braced his legs to charge---and then,
just as suddenly, relaxed.

"As you say," he growled, his tail still twitching.  "But I still want
to know who that damn chimpanzee was spying for."

"We call them 'trolls' here," Indy said, her voice still full of
steel.  "They're our neighbors.  And I imagine he was doing what any
neighbor would do if a bunch of strangers showed up next door---having
a look to see what's going on."

"There was a troll up by the spiderweb orchard this morning," Noxy
said, immediately wishing she hadn't when two heads turned to stare at
her.  "Sensy and I---we saw it when were coming back down."

"How come you didn't tell me?" her mother demanded.

"It's been kind of busy!" Noxy said defensively.  "Anyway, it wasn't
the same one.  It was older.  A lot older."

The tiger sat on his haunches.  "Is this normal here?
Chimp---*trolls* coming this close to a human settlement?  Because
they very much keep to themselves in Thind."

"No, it's not normal," Indy said.  She uncrossed her arms and
gestured.  "But if we're going to talk about it, would you like to
come in?"

The tiger regarded her coolly for a moment, then blinked and looked
away.  "Thank you," he said, his voice calm once again.  "Perhaps some
other time.  I should see if the sergeant needs me."  And without any
more goodbye than that, he rose and loped away.

Noxy let out her breath in a long whoosh.  "Well," she said shakily.
"That wasn't scary at all."

Her mother sat back down on her stool and squeezed her daughter's
hand.  "Hardly at all," she agreed.  "Are you all right?"

Noxy nodded.  "Sure," she lied.

Indy squeezed her hand again, then got up to close the door.  "Good.
Let's scramble some eggs and call it a day."  She took down their one
frying pan and set it on the stove beside the kettle.  "Tomorrow, I'm
going to see if I can get to know the sergeant a little better.  And I
think you ought to get to know the tiger's boy.  Let's see if we can
find out if they have any other surprises tucked away."

## Chapter 4: Getting To Know You

"Oh Noxy, brush your hair!" Indy set her tea down on the table and
began to stand.

"I can do it," Noxy protested. "I'm not a baby." She dragged the brush
she and her mother shared through her hair another few times. "Is that
better?"

Her mother sighed, just as her own mother once had. "Yes, I suppose.
Honestly, someone would think you'd been possessed by lightning.  Now
let's get going.  We don't want to keep them waiting."

They walked through the village together, squinting against the
sharp-edged morning sun.  The air smelled of pine smoke and fried
eggs.  People were sitting in twos and threes on stools outside their
houses wearing goofskin jackets or thick sweaters above sturdy
trousers and sturdier boots.  The men knitted or peeled potatoes while
the women picked spiderwebs apart apart and wound the strands onto
spools.

Indy had to stop to answer the same questions every dozen strides.
How were the soldiers getting on? What did they think of the village?
"We're on our way to ask," she replied over and over again.

Many of the village's elders didn't bother to hide their unhappiness
about their guests, but the only really sour face was Aft's.  "Has
that tiger eaten anyone yet?" he asked, forcing an awl through a scrap
of leather.  "Or is he too busy racing around on rooftops?"

Noxy felt nearly frantic with impatience by the time she and her
mother reached the trading hall where the soldiers had spent the
night.  She knew that talking to people was the most important part of
being mayor, and her mother liked doing it anyway, but what if someone
else was already showing the tiger's boy around the village?

She needn't have worried.  Sergeant Dorbu was sitting on the
guesthouse steps with the village's children cross-legged on the
stones in front of him.  Sensy and Rash looked up as Noxy arrived.
Noxy blinked.  Had they been holding hands?

"And this is called a greave," the sergeant said, pointing at the
armored front of his boot.  "It's to protect me from vampire mice.
See?" He tapped it with his fingernail, *clunk*.  "They could bite
that if they wanted, but all they'd do is blunt their teeth."

"What if they climbed up your leg?" asked Sensy.  Noxy rolled her
eyes.  Sensy could always be counted on to ask the questions grownups
wanted to hear.

"Ah, well, then I'd---oh, hello, mayor." The sergeant stood up,
brushing his hands on his kilt.  "The boy will be out in a heartbeat."

"Thank you, sergeant," said Indy.  "My daughter is looking forward to
showing him the village.  I trust you slept well?"

"Yes, thank you," said the sergeant.  "Although I..." He blinked, then
sniffed, then started to say, "Excuse me," but the sneeze came first.
*Hwah!* One of the younger children giggled, then clapped her hand
over her mouth.  The sergeant blinked and sniffed again.  "Sorry---too
many nights in the rain."

"Visitors from down below often catch colds in our thin air," said
Indy sympathetically.  "I hope it passes quickly."

The guesthouse door opened before the sergeant could reply.  The
children scrambled to their feet and stepped back as the tiger padded
out into the sunlight.  He wasn't as big as he'd been in Noxy's
troubled dreams during the night, but she still had to stop herself
from reaching for her mother's hand.

Almost unnoticed, his boy slipped out behind him and closed the door.
Instead of his armor, he wore a plain brown rain cape over his kilt
and boots.  He kept his eyes downcast as the tiger said, "Good
morning, mayor."

"Good morning, respected," Indy replied.  "I trust you slept well?"

"Thank you, I did." The tiger seemed not to notice that thirty pairs
of eyes were staring at him.  *He must be used to it,* Noxy thought.

Indy waited a moment to see if he would say anything more.  When he
didn't, she smiled and said, "My daughter has asked if you could spare
your boy for an hour so that she could show him our village while the
other children do their chores."  Noxy heard Rash mutter something at
that.  "If he would like to---oh dear." She stopped mid-sentence as
the sergeant took a deep breath and scrunched up his face.  "Nope," he
whooshed a moment later, blinking.  "That one's not ripe yet."

"You'd be better in bed than tramping around the countryside,
sergeant," Kulbinder rumbled.

"I agree," said Indy firmly.  "My mother will make you some lemon
ginger tea.  That will set you right in no time."

"Thang you," the sergeant said stuffily.  "Respected, will you---"

"I am going to explore the forest," the tiger declared.  "I would
rather we were not...surprised...as we were at the ford."  And with no
more ceremony than that, the tiger stood, stretched, and padded off
toward the main gate.

Indy clapped her hands.  "Right.  Everyone else, time for chores."  As
the children groaned and got to their feet, the tiger's boy finally
raised his eyes to look at Noxy.

"Hello," he said, stepping down to the cobblestones and bowing ever so
slightly.  "My name is Thokmay.  I'm pleased to meet you."

Noxy stuck out her hand.  "Hi.  I'm Probably Noxious, but call me
Noxy---everyone does."

The boy hesitated for a heartbeat, then took her hand in a grip much
stronger than Noxy had expected.  She was just as surprised to feel
the calluses on his hands.  He released her hand and gestured toward
the gate.  "After you."

Noxy and the tiger's boy walked side by side.  "That's the South
Tower," said Noxy, pointing at six rectangular stories of stone.  "It
still has a roof, but the stairs inside fell down a long time ago.
You used to be able to get up there by climbing a tree, but they cut
it down after Grappa Gas fell out of it for the second time.  That was
before I was born.  And that one's the Round Tower, and the short one
over there is called the Quick Tower, because it's quickest to get
up."

"It's a shame they've been allowed to go to ruin," said Thokmay.
"Princess Shudarga's engineers work year round to keep the walls of
Panday Castle sturdy.  Perhaps when the war is over she could send
some here to fix them."

"That would be nice," Noxy replied vaguely.  She wondered how Grappa
Gas would feel about having rebel engineers clambering around the
village's wall.  "Oh, and that's Granna Fee's house, with the moss
green door.  She's my grandmother.  And she teaches school.  And
that's Grappa Gas's house, the lavender one.  He used to be mayor.
And that's, um, well, they're all just different people's houses."

Noxy fell silent.  Thokmay had a polite but absent look on his face,
just like the one Indy got when Grappa Gas started talking about how
things had been in his day.  *It's probably not much compared to a
real castle,* she thought glumly.  Two-story houses with steep
shingled roofs, little vegetable gardens nestled between logs laid
parallel a stride apart, and all around, sharp mountain peaks looming
over the ancient gray walls...  She wouldn't have believed how strange
it all seemed to the young lowlander beside her.

They walked in silence along the path that ran next to the walls.
Ancient cobblestones showed through the hard-packed dirt in a few
places.  Noxy scuffed crusts of frost off a few absentmindedly,
wondering what else she could say.

Suddenly Thokmay stopped.  "What is that?" he asked.  A heavy wooden
grill lay across a shoulder-high opening in the wall ahead of them.
Behind it, rough stone steps led down into the mountain.

"That's just some old tunnels," said Noxy.  "We're not supposed to go
in."

Thokmay scowled.  "Sergeant Dorbu will want to know about them."

"Why?" Noxy asked.  "Most of them are flooded.  Except for the one
under Grappa Gas's house, and the ones by the drying sheds.  We use
them for cellars."

"Soldiers should know as much as they can about their surroundings,"
Thokmay said, as if repeating a lesson to a slow learner.

Noxy bit back a sharp retort.  "Come on," she said, hurrying ahead.
"We can see more from up top."

The steps lay flush against the side of the wall.  They had been built
for the Pilot Angels, not for human beings, so each one was as high as
Noxy's knee, and so broad that it took her two strides to cross.

Noxy put her left hand on the wall to steady herself each time she
thrust herself up a stair.  Even after hundreds of years, the stones
fit together so snugly that it was hard to tell where one ended and
the next began.  She noticed smugly that Thokmay was puffing and
sweating after only a few steps.

The top of the wall was wide enough for three soldiers to march side
by side.  The parapet along its outer edge was interrupted here and
there by slits for lookouts and archers.  "Makes Your Breath Rancid is
that way," Noxy said, pointing.  "You can't see it because the valley
bends, but sometimes you can see their clouds coming out of their
pen."

"Why do you call your villages things like that?" the young soldier
asked.

Noxy shrugged.  "They're called dragon names.  They're supposed to
make things sound unappetizing, so that when the dragons finally fly,
they'll think twice about eating us."

Thokmay snorted.  "That seems pretty far-fetched."

"Well, where does *your* name come from??" Noxy bristled.

"From the army orphanage," he replied, not looking at her.  "I had
another name before I went there, but they gave me a new one."

Noxy opened her mouth, then closed it.  For once, she had no idea what
to say.

As she was trying to think of something, Thokmay leaned through one of
the slits in the parapet and pointed into the gorge below them.  "Are
those the clouds we were on?"

Noxy glanced through the neighboring slit.  "Yup.  The bull is Big
Blue, and the cow is Pillow.  We've had them forever---they're
practically tame."

The two old clouds were hardly moving, but Noxy could have watched
them for hours.  She loved the way they slowly changed shape as they
drifted about, and how soft they felt when she stroked them.  Being up
in the sky on a cloud was like riding on a grownup's shoulders when
you were little, only a thousand times better.  You could see
everything---deer grazing beneath the twisted pines, mountain goofs
standing on rocky ledges no wider than the heel of your boot,
broad-winged condors making slow circles as they waited for a rabbit
to forget to look up...  When the air was still, and the cloud was
just drifting, it felt like the whole world was a story that was about
to be told for the very first time.

Thokmay stepped back and wrinkled his nose.  "They smell like wet
sheep."

"That's because they haven't rained for a while," Noxy explained
defensively.  "Rash and I will probably take them out tomorrow and let
them rain over the fish pond.  Here, come with me."

Descending the stairs was even harder on her knees than climbing them.
Rather than cutting directly through the village, she led Thokmay on a
roundabout path through the vegetable plots around its edges.  She'd
seen the looks Sensy and Rash had given her when her mother had sent
them off to do chores while she showed their youngest visitor around,
and she wasn't keen to bump into them until they'd had a chance to
cool off.

Once through the gate, she up the trail to the cloud pen.  Big Blue
and Pillow were both floating fifty strides away in the middle of the
gorge.  The bull was almost at their height, while the cow drifted
further down in his shadow.

"Can you call them over?" Thokmay asked.

Noxy shook her head.  "You have to be touching them to mind-speak with
them.  That's what the ropes and cradle seat are for---see?  If
they're not close enough to the edge, someone has to be reeled out
above them so they can jump on from there.  It's pretty dangerous,"
she added airily.

"I suppose," Thokmay said.  He wrinkled his nose.  "But I still think
they smell like wet sheep."

Noxy bit back an angry retort.  They didn't smell anything *like*
sheep, not really, and if he wasn't smart enough to---

*Twinge.* "Ouch," she muttered, putting her hand on the back of her
head.  The pain was strong enough this time that she thought there
would be a lump, but she couldn't feel anything.

"Is everything all right?" Thokmay asked, eyeing her.

"Yes, it's fine," she snapped.  She closed her eyes.  She had hoped
the clouds would be right next to the mounting platform so that he
could stroke one.  Or even get on, though she knew what her mother
would say about *that* if she found out.  Like a thousand cloudherds
before her, she wished the clouds would come when she whistled like
the goofs did.

"Um...  Are they supposed to be doing that?"  She opened her eyes at
Thokmay's words to see Big Blue turning toward them.  Below him,
Pillow was rising as quickly as Noxy had ever seen her move.

Thokmay stepped back instinctively as Big Blue bumped against the
mounting platform.  Noxy stroked the old bull's flank.  "See?" she
said.  "You can pull bits of them this way and that, but it all
settles back into a big lump after a while."  She grabbed a handful of
Big Blue's side and pulled as hard as she could.  When she let go, the
bit she had teased out slowly sank back into the cloud.

The young soldier patted the cloud gingerly.  Noxy grinned wickedly.
"Here, do this."  She backed up, then ran at the cloud and threw
herself up onto his back.  *Poof!* "Come on!" she said when Thokmay
hesitated.  "He won't bite."

"Noxious Aftertaste!  What do you think you're doing?"  Noxy's heart
leaped into her throat.  There, at the top of the steps that led down
to the platform, stood her mother and Sergeant Dorbu.  "You get off
that cloud *right now*, young lady!"

Noxy's stomach was churning by the time they reached the fortress
gate.  Her mother hadn't said a word to her on the walk back.  "Thank
you for the tour," Thokmay said politely, putting out his hand.

"You're welcome," Noxy mumbled.  She shook his hand and then waited
for the storm she knew was coming.

"And thank you as well," Sergeant Dorbu told Indy, smiling.  "It was a
pleasure."

"You're welcome," the mayor said.  If she had been anyone but Noxy's
mother, Noxy would have said she was blushing slightly.

As the sergeant walked away with Thokmay beside him, Indy rounded on
her daughter.  "Tell me," she said coldly, "What exactly would you
have done if he'd slipped off the cloud?"

"He wouldn't have slipped off!" Noxy protested.  "It was Big
Blue---he's as safe as---"

"I don't care if it was Big Blue or the mattress on your bed!" Indy
said angrily.  She didn't seem to care that half a dozen people were
listening just a few strides away.  "Do you know what the soldiers are
doing this afternoon?  Do you?  They're settling all their friends who
died before we could get to them.  What do you think they'd say if we
had to tell them there was one more to settle, just because you wanted
to show off?"

"Yes, mayor," Noxy said wretchedly.

"Don't you 'yes, mayor' me.  Now, Eyesie gave us some thimbleberries
for those old boots you'd outgrown.  I want you to get the seeds out
so that I can make a pie for dinner."

"Thimbleberries?" Noxy said in despair.  "That'll take forever!  Rash
and Sensy and I were going to---"

"Well, you should have thought of that, shouldn't you?"  Indy took
Noxy by the shoulders, wondering yet again when her daughter had grown
so tall.  "Daffodil, listen to me.  *Really* listen to me." She combed
her daughter's hair off her forehead with her fingers.  "Half the
village is already muttering about it being time for a new mayor.  How
can I ask them to behave when my own daughter won't? Now, go get
washed up and start on those thimbleberries."

Noxy nodded glumly.  "Yes, *amma*."

She moped home to collect the bucket full of hard red thimbleberries
and a large bowl, then climbed the steps to the top of the Quick
Tower.  She and Sensy had covered a tumbled-down block of stone with a
bit of gray canvas to make a pretend cloud the year before.  Plopping
herself down on it, she started squeezing bitter grain-sized seeds out
of the thimbleberries one by one.  Why did she have to be the one to
show him around?  Why couldn't the stupid soldiers have washed up
somewhere else?  And why did the sun have to be so...so sunny?

When she heard the first shouts from the main square she ignored them,
thinking that it was just children playing jump-sticks or *kabbadi*.
Then she heard Sergeant Dorbu shout, "Hah! Heeeyah!" She tossed
another berry into the bowl and stood up on her stone seat to look.

She was just in time to see Thokmay duck under the sergeant's
out-thrust sword and lunge with his own blade as he straightened up,
shouting "Hah!" in turn.  Every child in the village was gathered
around watching, and not a few of the adults as well.

The sergeant knocked Thokmay's blade away and spun around, slashing
left and right, one, two, three, as if he was fighting an invisible
opponent.  While his back was turned the young soldier stepped forward
and stabbed the sergeant in the ribs.

The sergeant groaned, pinning Thokmay's sword with his arm so that it
was pulled out of the boy's grip as Dorbu turned.  Thokmay only had
time to open his mouth before the sergeant's sword tapped him lightly
in the chest.  To Noxy's disgust, the children started to clap.

"You must keep your grip even after you strike," Kulbinder grumbled.
"No point giving your man one last blow."

"I know," said Thokmay, panting slightly.  "I forgot." The sergeant
handed his sword back to him.  both his blade and the sergeant's were
wrapped in leather so that they wouldn't cut.  They were smaller than
Noxy had imagined: each was only as long as its owner's arm, and no
thicker than a pottery plate.

Thokmay and the sergeant brought their swords up slowly, touched
blades with one another, and started fighting again.  Thokmay lost
quickly this time, but won the third round when the sergeant pretended
to stumble over a loose cobblestone.

They practiced for almost half an hour.  While the children clapped
and cheered, some of the older villagers shook their heads and swapped
disapproving looks.  Still, they kept watching.

By the time the sergeant and his young opponent stopped, they were
both soaked with sweat.  They saluted each other one last time.
"You're getting better every day," Sergeant Dorbu said.  "But we could
both use a wash-up."

Thokmay nodded, still breathing hard.  "Smells like we could both use
one too," he said.  For the first time, Noxy saw him smile.

"Show me, show me!" shouted Little Gas.  He clapped his hands with
excitement.  "I want to play!"

Thokmay's smile froze.  He glanced at the sergeant, who shook his head
almost imperceptibly.  "I'm glad you liked it," the young soldier said
to Little Gas.  His clear voice carried right across the village
square.  "But it's not really a game."

He squatted so that he was no taller than Little Gas.  "But I can show
you something else if you like," he said.  He looked left then right,
as if to make sure no spies or grownups were listening.

"Do you have any spare socks at home?" he asked.  Little Gas nodded.
"Good.  You go and get me three pairs of socks, quick as you can, and
three stones the size of your thumb."

Little Gas bit his lip.  "I only have just one other pair of socks,"
he said.  "They're for when it's winter, so my feet will fit in my
boots."

Thokmay's mouth opened, and closed, and opened again.  "Well," he
said, "Do you think your mother would let you borrow some?  Just for a
little bit?" Little Gas nodded quickly and scurried away.

"Do you want the rest of us to get some socks, too?" Sensy asked
hopefully.  She and Rash had been standing with the younger children,
their chores either done or conveniently forgotten.

"Oh, Sensy!" Noxy said under her breath.

"If you like," Thokmay said, straightening up.  Sensy spun around and
sprinted away.  A handful of other children ran off as well.

Little Gas came puffing back a moment later.  In his hands he had one
pair of green socks, one pair of gray, and one pair with red and white
stripes on them.  "Will these do?" he asked, fishing some stones out
of his pocket.

"They look fine," said Thokmay.  "Now, give me your stones...  Good.
Now, the first thing we do is we roll up the socks like this, with a
stone in the middle, to make a ball.  See? And then the next pair...
And the next...  Now, are you ready?" Little Gas nodded.

Thokmay stepped back, took a deep breath, and threw the balled-up
socks into the air.  His hands darted back and forth like
hummingbirds.  Somehow, he managed to catch each sock ball before it
fell to the ground, and then throw it again in time to catch the next
one.  He caught them overhand, he caught them underhand, he threw two
with his left hand while bouncing the third with his right, and then
he threw them all in the air at once and caught them, one, two, three.

There was a moment of stunned silence.  "That's magic!" Rash said
accusingly.  "You're doing magic!"

"It's not magic," Grappa Gas laughed, looking as delighted as any of
the children.  "It's called 'juggling'! I saw it in Chaghan once,
years ago.  It's just a trick."

"That's right," Thokmay agreed, "It's just a trick.  Here, I'll prove
it.  Sergeant?"

Sergeant Dorbu took the brightly colored sock balls and tossed them in
the air, one, two, three.  He whistled a happy little tune as he
juggled, and even managed to wink at Sensy (who blushed).  By the time
he was finished, Little Gas was laughing and clapping his hands.  "Let
me, let me!" he shrieked.  "I want to!"

"All right, but you have to let me show you how," Thokmay said.  "You
have to start with just two, like this.  Um, Sergeant? Could you show
the older children how it's done? Thank you.  Now, put this one in
this hand, and this one in the other, and..."

Noxy watched Little Gas drop all three pairs of socks, pick them up,
and drop them again.  The little boy laughed.  Seething, she sat back
down on her pretend cloud and glared at the bowl of thimbleberries.
It was going to be a long day...

## Chapter 5: Swimming

Noxy was still on her make-believe cloud an hour later, squeezing
seeds out of thimbleberries so angrily it was amazing the the bucket
didn't take fright and try to run away.  Sensy pretended not to notice
as she plopped herself down beside her friend.  "You should have tried
it!" she burbled.  "I only got them all up a few times, but it was so
much fun! Rash could do it almost right away."

"I'm sure it was wonderful," Noxy grumbled.

Sensy pouted.  "Don't be such a goof."

"I'm not being a goof!  I just think he was showing off.  What did
Rash think about him putting his arms around you like that?" The last
time Noxy had looked at the juggling, Thokmay had been standing right
behind Sensy, reaching around to hold her arms just below the elbows.

Sensy brushed her hair back over her ear and grinned.  "Why should I
care what Rash thinks?" she asked sweetly.  Her grin turned into a
leer.  "Or maybe you're the one who cares?"

"Well, *I* think it was embarrassing," Noxy said primly.  "You were
all following him around like ducklings, just because he knew a stupid
trick."

"Well, at least he didn't make everyone say please nine times, like
you did when I wanted to play with the whirlidoodle Granna Fee got you
for your nameday last year!"

Noxy's mouth fell open.  Sensy had never talked back to her before!

The same thought must have occurred to Sensy.  She looked down at the
bucket by Noxy's feet.  "Wow, you've got a lot done."

"Not enough.  Here." She nudged the bucket with her foot.  "If you
want to gossip, you might as well help."

Sensy brushed her hair back over her ear.  "I wasn't gossiping!  I
just came up to tell you that we're going to teach him how to play
Snakes and Whistles."

"Snakes and Whistles? He must know how to play that!"

"Nuh uh.  We were talking about it while we were juggling, and he said
he'd never even heard of it.  I guess they play different games down
below."

"I guess," Noxy echoed dubiously.  She pursed her lips, then stood up
abruptly.  "Well? What are we waiting for? Let's go show him."

By unspoken agreement, Noxy and Sensy didn't go through the main
square---there was no point drawing anyone's attention to the fact
that Noxy had set her chores aside.  Instead, they picked their way
through the stakes and strings in the village pepper garden, held
their breaths as they snuck past the tannery, and slipped out of the
fortress gate as quietly as shadows.

They reached the clearing where the other children had gathered just
as Rash finished explaining the rules to Thokmay.  "But if you can run
all the way back without getting whistled again, then you're safe," he
said.  "I think that's everything."

"What's out of bounds?" someone asked.

"The heather bush, the ponderosa, the lizard rock, and that pile of
earcones," Rash said, pointing at each landmark in turn.

"Did you tell him about not making two snakes at once?" Noxy asked.

Everyone groaned.  "Oh, we're not going to play like that, are we?"
Sensy pouted.  "It takes forever! Anyway, who's going to be leads?"

"You do one team with Thokmay," Noxy said immediately.  "Rash can be
with me.  Everyone else, pick a side!"

The first game only lasted a few minutes.  Thokmay ran straight for
the middle of the field and was whistled almost at once.  Noxy
whistled Sensy a moment later while she was trying to explain what had
happened.  After that, her team couldn't get more than two or three
children into a snake before being whistled by someone from Noxy's
team.

Then Noxy and her team were the snakes, and the tables were turned.
Thokmay swooped down on people like a hawk on a rabbit.  He whistled
three children in as many breaths, then doubled back and whistled Noxy
before she finished saying, "Hey!"

They played until only Rash and Thokmay were left.  Rash feinted left,
then tried to run right, but Thokmay matched him step for step.  The
other children cheered him on, shouting, "Back up!  Come on, Rash!
Make a hoop!" but he just couldn't find an opening.

Rash feinted left again, hesitated for half a heartbeat as if to go
right, then carried on to the left.  Thokmay stumbled and went down on
one knee.  Rash raced past him, then stopped, walked back, and stuck
out his hand to help him up.  Everybody cheered---everybody except
Noxy.

"Looks like a tie," Rash said, grinning.

"A tie?" Noxy exclaimed.  "There's no such thing as a tie!"

"There is now," Rash replied.  "You're not the only one who gets to
make up rules, you know."

"No, no, she's right," Thokmay panted.  "I'm beaten, fair and square."
He picked up a nearby stick, saluted, and handed it to Rash.

"I'm surrendering," he explained.  "Now you break my sword over your
knee and hand me back the hilt."

Rash snapped the branch, then hesitated.  "Which end is the hilt?"

"It doesn't really matter," Thokmay told him.  Rash gave him the
shorter piece of the stick.  The young soldier accepted it gravely and
tucked it into his belt.  As he did so, Noxy saw him catch Rash's eye
and wink.  Rash winked back, as if sharing a joke.  Noxy could have
punched them both.

"What happens if he doesn't accept your surrender?" Sensy asked.

"He has to," Thokmay assured her.  "Nobody would serve under someone
who didn't."

"Who said anything about serving under you?" Noxy asked petulantly.

"Oh Noxy!" "That's not what he said!" She flushed as the others
rounded on her.

Thokmay looked up at the sun.  "I should get back.  Thank you all for
the game."  He bowed at the village children's answering chorus of
thanks and then walked away, the broken stick still in his hand.
After exchanging glances, Sensy and Rash followed him.  As the rest of
the children followed them, a sinking feeling in the pit of Noxy's
stomach told her that maybe the young soldier actually had won the
game---just not the game she'd thought they were playing.

Indy and Grappa Gas were by the gate when Noxy got back, deep in
conversation with Sergeant Dorbu.  The tiger was there as well,
sitting on his haunches, with Thokmay at his side.  Not for the first
time, Noxy wished there was some other way into Stale that didn't
involve jumping off a low-flying cloud.

"But respected, I promise they'll stay out of everyone's way,"
Sergeant Dorbu was saying.

Indy shook her head.  "Letting you and yours stay here to heal up is
one thing," she said apologetically.  "But if your men start walking
patrols, it'll look an awful lot like we're joining this fight."

"Nothing wrong with that," Grappa Gas muttered, subsiding when Indy
shot him a warning look.

Kulbinder cleared his throat. "May I suggest a compromise?  What if
some of the men were to ride with you when you take the clouds up?
Sure no one could object to you giving them tours?"  He flicked an
ear.  "I'm sure my boy for one would enjoy it."

Ten minutes later Noxy was up in the Quick Tower on her make-believe
cloud, her thimbleberries at her feet and her mother's pointed
reminder still stinging in her ears.  *It's just not fair,* she
thought angrily.  *I have to sit here doing chores, but **he** gets to
go riding.*

She tossed the berries she had picked up back into the bucket and
clambered up to look over the parapet.  Pillow was just leaving the
cloud pen with Grappa Gas and Thokmay on her back.  Noxy could almost
hear Grappa Gas saying, "There's nothing in the world as comfortable
as an old cloud," just like he always did when he took *her* for a
ride.  At least he hadn't brought some maple twists to share with
Thokmay---at least, she *hoped* he hadn't.

*He'll let Pillow rain on the fish pond first,* she thought, *That
way, she won't be fidgety.*

Sure enough, Grappa Gas brought the cloud around in a graceful turn
toward the fishpond.  She didn't need any more instruction than
that. She drifted to a stop, then started to rain contentedly.  The
pair of elders sitting on log benches beside the pond returned Grappa
Gas's wave.

Noxy closed her eyes.  She could practically mind-hear the old cow's
contentment as she slowly began to lighten.  *Why don't you just drop
him in the pond?* she thought despondently.

*Bad,* she imagined Pillow replying.  *Bad hurt.*

*Oh, he'd be all right,* she replied in her head.  *The pond's pretty
deep.  And it'd serve him right for showing off with all his juggling
and his surrendering and stuff.* She imagined Pillow thinning out
underneath Thokmay little by little.  He wouldn't notice right away,
not on his second-ever flight with Grappa Gas talking a gallop a
breath beside him.

She opened her eyes in shock.  There, a hundred strides below her, she
saw Thokmay sink slightly, then some more. He yelped as he suddenly
realized what was happening.

"Hold on!" Grappa Gas shouted, reaching for him, but it was too
late. Thokmay cried out as he fell through the hole in the cloud and
splashed into the ice-cold fishpond.

His head burst above water a moment later. "Help!" he screamed. "Help
me! I can't---" He thrashed his arms as if he was trying to swim, but
something was pulling him down.

Noxy's hand flew to her mouth. His armor! Thokmay must have put his
armor back on!  She watched in horror as Grappa Gas shouted at the
elders to get help. With two quick steps he reached the edge of the
cloud and jumped.

A moment later he surfaced in the pond, spluttering and shouting,
"I've got you, lad!" The old man wrapped one arm around Thokmay and
began to backstroke toward the edge of the pond with the other.

Noxy pelted down the stairs, shouting that they'd fallen in the pond,
both of them, they were going to freeze!  Like everyone who had grown
up in the mountains, she knew how relentless the cold was.  Even if
Grappa Gas got Thokmay out of the water, it could still---

The tiger surged past her.  "Canaries on me!" he roared.  Stalers
leaped out of his way with startled shouts as he charged across the
square and through the gate.

Grappa Gas and Thokmay had been hauled out of the pond and wrapped in
goofskin coats by the time Noxy got there, but were shivering
uncontrollably.  "How did this happen?" Kulbinder demanded for the
tenth time.  "How could he fall?"

Aft shouldered through the gathering crowd with a pair of round jugs
in his hands.  Handing one to Granna Fee, he twisted the lid off the
other and knelt beside the pond to fill it with water, then screwed
the lid back on.

"You just had to show off, didn't you?" he growled at his father.
Without waiting for a reply, he unscrewed the lid and passed the jug
to his father.  "Drink up."

Grappa Gas pushed the now-steaming water aside weakly.  "G-g-give it
to th-th-the boy," he stuttered.

"I'll take care of the boy," Granna Fee said.  She tipped her jug so
that Thokmay could take a sip.  "There you go.  Nice and slow.
That'll warm you up from the inside."

"Th-th-thank you, resp-p-pected."  Thokmay reached for the jug

Granna Fee shook her head.  "I'll hold onto it for now," she said,
kindly but firmly.  "Ulfmaerr only made the two of them, and if you
knew what this old goof eats, I don't think you'd want to share with
him."

It was another ten minutes before Thokmay and Grappa Gas could stand.
They hobbled up the path toward Stale side by side with a crowd of
villagers and soldiers around them.  As they left the pond, Kulbinder
cut Indy off.  "How could this happen?" His ears were flat against his
head, and his eyes glinted dangerously.  "He could have died!"

"They both could have," the mayor replied steadily.  She matched the
tiger's stare until the big cat blinked and looked away.

"I apologize," he rumbled.  "But that doesn't change my question.  I
thought these clouds were safe."

"They are."  Noxy heard the worry in her mother's voice.  "We've been
riding them forever---Big Blue was Grappa Gas's first ride, and
Pillow's not much younger.  They've never done anything like this."

Standing unnoticed two paces behind her mother, Noxy felt as shaky as
Grappa Gas and Thokmay.  She knew why Pillow had dropped Thokmay in
the pond, but she also knew that it was impossible to mind-speak to a
cloud without touching it.  The only problem was, she had felt herself
do it.

She waited with everyone else by the trading hall until Granna Fee
came out.  "He'll be all right," she reassured her granddaughter.  "We
got the hot water into him before the cold could take root."

"Thanks, *amma*."  Noxy fell into step beside her grandmother.  "Do
you think---I mean, I heard people talking.  Do you think someone
could have made Pillow drop him?"

"What? Who said that?" Granna Fee asked sharply.

"I don't know," Noxy hedged, not meeting her grandmother's eyes.  "I
just---I know Grappa Gas wouldn't have done it, and he was the only
'herd on her, and people can't mind-talk to clouds if they're not on
them---can they?"

Her grandmother stopped abruptly and put her hand on Noxy's arm.  "Why
don't we go have a cup of tea?" she said quietly.  "We can talk then."

Ten minutes later they were sitting at the tiny table in Granna Fee's
two-room house, waiting for the kettle to boil.  "I wish we could have
just used one of the magic jugs," Noxy joked weakly.

Granna Fee smiled.  "Me too.  But it'll take them a couple of days at
least to soak up enough heat to work again."  She spooned some tea
into her chipped brown pot, peered at it, and added another spoonful.
"I asked your father if he could make another one, but he said that
part of him was all used up."

"Did he say what part?" Noxy asked hesitantly.

Her grandmother shook her head.  "I didn't ask.  Here, I'll get that."
She took the whistling kettle off the stove and slowly poured the
steaming water into the teapot.  Setting the kettle on a polished
whorl of ironbark, she winked at Noxy and reached into her knitting
basket to pull out a small jar and opened it.  "Honey?"

"I thought you were out?" Noxy said, taking it.

"Only when Gas comes over.  That man..."  She shook her head in mock
despair.

They sipped their tea and put their cups down in unison, as they had
countless times since Indy had become mayor and Noxy had started
spending more time with her granna than with her mother.  "So what
*do* you think happened?" Noxy asked, hoping Granna Fee couldn't hear
her heart thumping.

The old woman shook her head.  "I don't know.  Your father---" She
stopped herself.  "Do you know how he discovered he could do magic?"

Noxy shrugged.  "*Amma* never said."

Granna Fee settled back in her chair with a wince, warming her hands
with her teacup.  "He was fishing one day---not in a pond like here,
but with a net in the ocean, back where he grew up---and he wished
that he was done for the day.  A heartbeat later the net fell apart in
his hands and..."  She shrugged.  "No net, no fishing.  But when he
got back to land and tried to tie up his boat, he couldn't make a
knot.  Every time he tried, he'd drop the end of the rope or it would
tangle in his fingers or something else would happen.  Something had
heard his wish and taken it as a bargain."

She leaned forward.  "He was lucky.  There was another magician in the
town where he grew up who could teach him how to control it.  But he
still wound up making some bad bargains."

"Like having to live where nobody had ever slept on the sea," Noxy
said.

Granna Fee nodded.  "Like that.  It saved someone from shipwreck, he
said, but he was half-crazy by the time he got here.  Even down in
Duck Droppings there was someone who'd been on a ship once, so he
couldn't stay there more than a couple of nights."

"But what does this have to do with Pillow?" Noxy asked.

Granna Fee shrugged again.  "What if it wasn't Pillow?  What if
someone here can do magic, but doesn't realize it yet?"

Noxy took another sip of tea.  Her mouth suddenly felt dry.  "Who?"

"I don't know," her grandmother admitted.  "It might not even be one
of us.  I heard a couple of the soldiers talking in the trading hall
last night, and some of them are pretty angry at the tiger for not
spotting the ambush that got their friends killed.  Maybe one of
them...  I don't know.  It's all so tangled up, half the king's army
on one side and the rest with the princess.  Who knows how many wound
up on the wrong side?"

They talked about other things after that, normal everyday things like
when it would be time to shear the goofs of their winter wool and how
Sensy only seemed to want to talk about her hair and her clothes and
who they might meet that summer and how many dishes Grappa Gas would
wash for a taste of honey.  It felt warm and comfortable, and was
almost enough to convince Noxy that her grandmother might be
right---that what had happened earlier that day had nothing to do with
her.

"I should go," Noxy finally said, eyeing her empty teacup regretfully.
"If I don't get those thimbleberries done, *amma* will shear *me*."

Granna Fee smiled.  "How about you bring them down here and we'll do
them together?"

"Thanks, *amma*, but I said I'd do it."  She stood, then impulsively
stepped around the table to give her grandmother a hug.  "I love you."

"I love you too, daffodil."  They held each other for a moment, one
wondering when the other had gotten so big, the other wondering when
the first had gotten so small, and then Noxy left.

## Chapter 6: The Coming Storm

Afternoon was flirting with evening by the time Aft returned on
Pillow.  "She was huddled up in the canyon above Tinker's Creek," he
told Indy, his face set in an even deeper scowl than usual.  "She was
skittish like I've never seen her.  Managed to spook a whole graze of
wildings, too.  One poke and it'll turn into a stampede."

Indy nodded.  Aft had found her up on the wall, where she had come to
check on Noxy's progress.  The two adults were looking west, where
sheets of cirrus were gathering above the peaks.  "Then let's hope
nothing pokes them," she said after a moment.  "Although the way this
day's gone..."

Noxy kept her eyes on her thimbleberries.  She had learned a long time
ago that if she didn't draw attention to herself, adults would
sometimes forget that she could hear them.  She had learned a lot
about cloudherding and negotiating with traders that way, along with a
few things about her mother's youthful misadventures that she was
definitely not supposed to know.

After a few more details about the wild clouds he'd seen and a barbed
comment about whether there was anything his father wouldn't do to
impress people, Aft nodded a goodbye and left.  "Finish those later,"
Indy told Noxy, her eyes still on the gathering clouds.  "We have
other chores right now."

Stale was no stranger to storms.  When bulls battled each other in the
dead of winter, the snow fell so thick and so fast that people had to
string ropes between the houses to find their way.  And in the summer,
when nimbus clouds that had stayed in the north to give birth flew
south to rejoin their herds, the sky could darken in the time it took
to sing a nursery rhyme.  When that happened, the villagers knew it
was time to tie their shutters closed and get the goofs indoors,
because the rain was going to come down in sheets instead of drops.

"I am from Thind," Kulbinder growled when Indy told him why she wanted
the soldiers to stay in the trading hall.  "I have lived through
monsoons.  This could not possibly be worse."

"Maybe not, but I bet it'll be a lot colder," Sergeant Dorbu said.  He
and his men had spent the afternoon washing the bodies of their fallen
comrades and patching the holes and tears in their uniforms.  Those
who were well enough had scoured the woods for firewood as well,
stacking it to make a pyre just down the hill from the fortress gate.
Indy and Noxy had found him there, helping as best he could while
three of the village elders laid a spiderweb net over the wood so that
it wouldn't blow away.

Kulbinder sniffed.  "Storm or not, someone should be on patrol.  But I
agree, it would be best if the men stayed warm."

"How---how is Thokmay doing?" Noxy asked hesitantly.

The tiger looked at her for a moment before replying.  "He is well,"
he said.  "He is strong, and Respected Gas got to him quickly.  He
will be well."

The sun had almost disappeared behind the mountains when the first
sharp line of lightning sparked the far-off clouds.  Granna Fee said a
word Noxy wasn't supposed to know.  "Let's not dawdle," she said
briskly, pulling another armload of damp laundry off a drying line and
stuffing it in a sack.  Ten strides away, Little Gas was pulling apart
strips of cedar bark so that Sensy could lay them along the irrigation
trenches in the vegetable garden.  Children, grandparents, and
everyone else who could walk hurried to ready the village, stepping
around soldiers or shooing them out of the way as they watched the
sudden flurry of activity with bemusement.

Noxy carried the last sack of laundry upstairs to her bedroom for want
of anywhere else to put it.  Her mother was chopping onions by the
time she got back downstairs.  "Thanks, daffodil," she said, blinking
away a tear.  "Can you do some potatoes?  And see if the cheese is
still fit to eat.  I hope the tiger isn't too picky."

Noxy pulled up short.  "The tiger?"

Indy sniffled.  "Yes, he's coming for dinner.  So is the sergeant.
His boy's still in bed."  She swept a double handful of diced onions
into the cooking pot with the back of the knife and started peeling
what was probably the last knob of ginger in Stale.  "It's the polite
thing to do," she continued without looking as Noxy opened and then
closed her mouth.

"Yes, *amma*."  Noxy set the loosely-woven bag of potatoes on the
potato and began to scrub the skins off them with a piece of
sandstone.  She had almost decided to tell her mother what had really
happened that morning, but that wasn't a discussion she wanted to
start now---not the way her mother got whenever company was coming.

Sergeant Dorbu knocked on their door just as the rain began to fall.
Noxy had been expecting him to be in his uniform, but he had traded in
his helmet for a plain goofskin cap that any cloudherd might have
worn, and had left his sword behind.

Kulbinder padded in behind him while he and Indy were saying their
hellos.  He flowed up onto the chair across from Noxy and watched
impassively as she swept the last scraps of potato off the table.  "He
is better," the tiger said abruptly.

Noxy jumped slightly.  "Oh.  You mean Thokmay?  Um, I'm glad to hear
it.  It's pretty dangerous, getting dunked in frozen water like that.
It happened to one of the goofs a couple of years ago.  She got out of
their pen and tried to get across the---um.  It doesn't matter.  But
I'm glad he's all right."  She could feel her cheeks burning under the
tiger's cool stare.

Her cheeks heated up even more when she saw Sergeant Dorbu's grin.
"Don't worry," he said cheerfully.  "He does that to everyone.
Saints, I almost swallowed my fork the first time I met him."

"It was a spoon," Kulbinder corrected.  "And it was more than
'almost'."

And just like that the rhythm of the meal took shape.  Sergeant Dorbu
had a seemingly inexhaustible supply of stories about his foolishness,
clumsiness, or bad choices.  Indy asked just enough questions to keep
the stories coming, while Kulbinder's dry comments provoked protests
of innocence and occasional snorts of laughter.  As she table a tray
bearing grilled slabs of cheese, fried onions, and boiled potatoes,
Noxy realized with a start that she was actually enjoying herself.
The mood was only slightly dampened by the tiger sniffing at the
cheese and then saying thank you, but it would probably upset his
digestion, he would hunt in the forest after the storm was over.

Conversation became more serious after the dishes were cleared.  The
Angry Canaries had declared for Princess Shudarga almost as soon as
she raised her banner, and had been fighting ever since.  "Or getting
to a fight, or getting away from one, or trying to get enough food in
our bellies to keep us fighting," Sergeant Dorbu added.  "We were up
north, with the Cut Cards under Colonel Ordshe, right in the middle of
Shudarga's land."

"Is that why you chose her side?" Indy asked as she splashed some dark
mountain *rak* into a glass and passed it to him.  Catching Noxy's
eye, she poured a thimbleworth into another glass and handed it to her
daughter.  The pungent fumes tingled in Noxy's nose as she tasted it
gingerly.

Sergeant Dorbu shook his head.  "Wasn't for that.  My family..."  He
paused, rolling his glass between his hands as if to warm them.  "We
used to have land.  Not much---really just a big farm with a couple of
tenants to work it---but it was enough to keep us.  Then one of our
neighbors decided he wanted it.  She honeyed up the local *tralpa*,
promised him a slice of the takings, and..."  He spread his hands.
"By the time we got to court, she'd rented all the laws that would
have saved us.  We had a week to clear out after living their all our
lives."

"That must have been horrible," Indy said sympathetically.

"It is foolishness," Kulbinder rumbled.  "The law in Thind is not
something to be borrowed for money like a bullock.  There are rules
for each station, and that is that."

"But then how does the king raise money?" Noxy asked.

Kulbinder blinked slowly.  "The emperor takes what he needs when he
needs it.  It is...simpler."

"Simpler *and* fairer," Sergeant Dorbu added with a quiet intensity
that hadn't been there a moment earlier.  "And that's what the
princess wants.  Laws should be there for everyone, all the time, not
just for whoever has the most money on the day of a trial.  And if
that means a bunch of royals have to work for a living instead of
renting out laws some king gave their great-great-grands way back
when, that's fine by me."  He drained his glass in one quick gulp.
When her mother did the same, Noxy held her breath and swallowed the
last of her own *rak*.

The thick black liquid felt like fiery smoke as it went down her
throat.  She clenched her jaw, but a strangled cough managed to
escape.  "And that's enough for *you* tonight," her mother said in
mock-disapproval.

"Yes, *amma*," Noxy said, gasping for air.

"Here."  Her mother pushed the empty kettle across the table.  "How
about you refill that and I'll make tea?  It sounds like the worst of
the storm has passed, and a bit of air will help you clear your head."

Noxy nodded, not trusting herself to speak.  She slipped her feet into
her boots without bothering to do up the laces, pulled a poncho over
her head, and stumbled out into the night.

Rain was still falling, but Indy had been right---most of the panicked
clouds had passed, and the few stragglers chasing them were already
east of Stale, heading toward the plains.  She watched them for a
moment, then closed her eyes.

"Goof," she muttered a moment later.  Of *course* she hadn't been able
to mind-hear anything.  What had happened earlier with Thokmay had
been a coincidence.  She shouldn't---

Something clattered in the narrow jitty between her house and the
yarning shed.  Noxy opened her mouth to ask who was there, but stopped
herself.  What if the troll had come back?  There was no reason it
would, but there was no reason it would have been in the village in
the first place.

She set the kettle down quietly on the front step of her house and
tiptoed gingerly toward the jitty.  Holding her breath, she leaned
forward and peeked around the corner, just in time to see a shadowy
figure disappear out the other end.  It was definitely a person, not a
troll, but who would be out in the rain?

*The soldiers,* she realized.  It had to be one of the soldiers,
except why would they be out in the rain either?  Suspicious, she
hurried to follow.

"Ow!"  Ten steps in, her foot connected with a pile of cobblestones
that she and Sensy had put there as part of some long-forgotten game.
The stones clattered as they tumbled over.  Cursing under her breath,
she stepped over them, wishing that she had taken a moment earlier to
do up her laces.  Some of the broken cobbles had sharp edges, and if
she lost a boot now, she'd never catch up.

She reached the other end of the jitty just in time to see the shadowy
figure disappear around the edge of the tannery.  She hesitated for
only a moment before sprinting after it, her boots splashing in
shallow puddles of rainwater.  Whoever she was chasing was bound to
hear her---the only question was whether she could catch them first.

She rounded the corner of the tanning shed a moment later.  Her quarry
was nowhere to be seen.  "Rot," she cursed.  Left toward the trading
hall, straight on toward the square, or right toward the vegetable
patches and the gate?

*Crack!* She shrieked with surprise as a bolt of lightning split the
sky, then stomped her foot, angry at herself, the rain, and the world
in general.  She'd lost them.  And by the time she got back, her
mother was sure to give her the "what took you so long?" look that she
hated so much.

*Crack!* Another bolt of lightning left a dazzling scar on the night.
That one had been close, she realized uneasily---too close.  The
lightnings must be nipping at the clouds that had fallen behind their
herd.  She was suddenly glad that she wasn't airborne.  She had only
ever been on one night flight, when Granna Fee took her up on her
nameday when she turned ten to show her a passing star.

*CRACK! BOOM!* Noxy shrieked as the third bolt of lightning struck the
weatherduck spinning madly next to the fortress gate and shattered its
wooden pole.  Splinters flew in all directions to clatter off roofs
and cobblestones.

One smoking scrap bounced off a chimney and clattered through a window
whose shutter had been left untied.  As Noxy blinked to clear the
after-dazzle of the lightning strike from her eyes, the sheets of
dried moss that the wood had landed in began to smolder.

A door banged open.  "Saints!" Aft hurried over to Noxy.  "Are you all
right?  What in the name of all that rots are you doing out in this?"

"*Amma* wanted me to fill the kettle," Noxy said stupidly.  She shook
her head.  "It---the lightning it."

"I can see the lightning hit it," Aft said testily.  He took her by
the shoulders and peered into her eyes, then relaxed slightly.
"You'll be all right.  Just a bit of a scare.  Come on, let's get you
back to---wait."  He sniffed.  "What's burning?"

Noxy grabbed his arm and pointed.  "There!  Upstairs!"  A bright lick
of flame was suddenly dancing in a window.  Another joined it as the
familiar herby smell of burning moss caught in Noxy's nostrils.

"Get your mother!" Aft ordered, then cupped his hands around his
mouth.  "Fire!  Fire!  Fire!"

The village was lucky.  That's what everyone told themselves half an
hour later.  They were lucky that the rain had made everything so wet,
that there had been so little of the autumn moss left to burn, that
Aft had spotted the fire so quickly.  They were lucky the soldiers had
been there to fill and pass buckets---with most of the adults gone,
well, the elders and children would have done the best they could, but
things could have been a lot worse.

"But what were you doing *there*?" Indy demanded as she and her
daughter walked home arm in arm.  "You were just supposed to refill
the kettle!"

"I thought I saw something, like a troll."  Noxy shook her head.  "I
didn't get a good look at it."  Which wasn't exactly a lie, but was an
uncomfortable distance from the truth.  The hooded figure had
definitely been a person, but a bit short for an adult.  And as the
soldiers had arrived to help with the fire, only one of them had been
the height of the figure she had seen.  But why would Thokmay have
been out in the rain when he could have been at dinner?  And what had
he been doing in the jitty beside her house?

## Chapter 7: Discovered!

Stale woke to the muffled stillness that only ever comes after storms
and minor disasters.  The air was still damp and chill, but the sky
was so clear that the peaks around the village almost sparkled.  A
sharp-edged whiff of charred wood hung everywhere, sweetened slightly
by the potpourri of the moss that the brief fire had consumed.

It was a day for dawdling: for taking a little longer than usual to
get out of bed, for letting the kettle boil a few heartbeats longer
than it needed to, for discussing the day's chores in a little more
detail than absolutely necessary rather than getting up from breakfast
to start doing them.  No one wanted to hurry, not even the soldiers
whose turn it was to patrol the road leading up to Stale and the paths
through the forest behind it.

Sergeant Dorbu spread his hands helplessly when Indy asked if the
patrols were strictly necessary.  "Regulations," he said
apologetically.

Grappa Gas nodded firmly.  "That's right.  Have to stick to routine if
you don't want people to go slack."  Indy and Noxy had found the two
of them in the square, sharing strong cups of tea and advice about how
best to extend the fishpond (though Noxy suspected the sergeant had
mostly been listening to that part).

A shutter clattered open above them.  Noxy glanced up to see Aft
glaring down at them, his own mug clenched in his hand.  When he
realized she had seen him, he scowled and disappeared from the window.

Indy followed her daughter's gaze.  "All right," she told the sergeant
absently.  "If you think it's necessary."  She put her hand on Noxy's
shoulder.  "Why don't you round up Sensy and Rash and see if you can
keep the littles busy this morning?  We need to clean up the mess from
last night, and they'd just be under foot."

By the time the soldiers and Kulbinder left twenty minutes later, Aft
and Indy were working with a dozen elders to tear apart the ruined
upper floor of the burned storage shed.  Charred beams were knocked
free by heavy hammers and set in a pile to have their nails pulled.
In a moment of inspiration, Noxy had Rash and Sensy drag a few of the
least-damaged timbers to the other side of the square and lay them out
in a zig-zag pattern for the littles to walk along.  Were they a
tightrope?  A secret path through a jungle?  Or a bridge over a pit
full of lava, and if you fell off, you'd be burned alive?  The littles
seemed to be happy to believe all three at once, and as far as Noxy
was concerned, anything that kept them from interrupting her repeated
yawns was fine.

It was shaping up to be a perfect morning until one of the soldiers
who had gone on patrol came running through the gate with his sword in
his hands and bellowed, "At arms!  At arms!  They've found us!"

Sergeant Dorbu dropped the beam he was manhandling and swung down from
the upper story of the ruined shed.  "Soldier! Report!" he snapped.

The soldier pulled up short and thumped his fist to his chest in
salute.  His left hand was still in bandages, and the stitches holding
the gash on his check closed were crusty with scabs.  "Respected!" he
wheezed.  "They... they..."

"Catch your breath, soldier."  Sergeant Dorbu wiped his hand clean on
his kilt and put two fingers in his mouth to whistle.  The shrill
double tone made Noxy jump.  One of the children who had been walking
the zig-zag of beams stumbled, then started to cry because she had
stepped in the lava and had to go back to the beginning.  Sensy
shushed her, eyes as wide as Noxy's as the soldiers who had stayed
behind tumbled out of the trading hall door, some on crutches, others
still pulling on clothes.

"Respected!"  The soldier straightened up and saluted again.
"Royalist rangers, respected.  Two of 'em, light packs, with forest
bows and short swords.  The tiger got 'em."

"Alive?" Sergeant Dorbu demanded.

The soldier nodded.  "Yes respected.  Chased 'em into us, respected,
just like we practiced."  He gulped.  "But there was a bird with 'em,
respected.  A crow.  It got away."

"Rot," Sergeant Dorbu swore.  "Was it Gifted?"

The soldier shook his head.  "Dunno, respected.  Didn't hear it say
anything."

Indy cut in.  "Sergeant, does this mean there's an army coming?"  The
question sent Sensy's hands flying to her mouth.  Before Noxy could
say anything to comfort her, Rash put his arm over her shoulders and
gave her a squeeze.  On any other day, Noxy would have been shocked
and said something sarcastic.  Right then, her only thought was a
slightly bewildered, *But I'm scared too.*

Sergeant Dorbu thought a moment before shaking his head.  "Not likely,
mayor.  Rangers usually stay a day or two out from regular soldiers.
My bet is a regiment has settled in at the foot of the pass to hold it
closed now that it's clear enough to get through."  He scowled.  "But
if these two don't report back---"

"---someone's going to come looking for them," Indy finished bleakly.

The next few minutes were as rushed as the time before had been
relaxed.  Dorbu picked a dozen men by name and told them to get their
gear on.  He sent the rest back to bed---they could still barely walk,
and if there *was* going to be a fight, he wanted them out of it.  But
no, he didn't think there'd be a fight---not today, anyway.

"And tomorrow?" Grappa Gas asked.  "What are we all supposed to while
you lot are chopping each other to pieces in the square?  No, I
*won't* shush!"  he snapped at Indy as she opened her mouth.  "Having
a laugh at the *tralpa* is one thing, but sheltering rebels, that's
another, and if you think we won't be held to answer for it when the
king's men show up---"

"It won't come to that," Sergeant Dorbu interrupted.  "I promise."  He
raised his voice.  "I spoke to the mayor last night.  If the royalists
show up in force, we'll either take our chances getting through the
pass, or surrender.  We won't put you in danger."  He drew his knife
and laid it across his palm.  "On my blood."

"No need for that," Indy said hastily.  "We're happy to just take your
word.  Aren't we?"  She shot a stern look at Grappa Gas.

"Of course," the old man grumbled.  He looked at the handful of nails
he'd accumulated and sighed.  "What a mess."

The patrol arrived back in Stale a few minutes later with its two
prisoners, but without Kulbinder, who was combing the woods for other
rangers.  "Or that damn bird," one of the soldiers said.  "I'm sorry,
respected, I should have got an arrow off, but it was just so rotting
quick."

"Don't worry about it," Sergeant Dorbu said, clapping him on the
shoulder.  "Now, who do we have here?"

The royalist soldiers wore the same kilts and armor as the rebels, but
had red and blue bands on their cuffs.  Glancing at the sergeant's
sleeves, Noxy saw stitch marks where matching bands had been removed.
Both men had weathered faces and close-trimmed beards, though the
larger one's was going gray while the smaller's was still as black as
his skin.  Both wore the same expression of sullen resignation, and
neither seemed inclined to answer the sergeant.

He waited a moment, then sighed.  "All right.  Respected, is there a
shed of some sort we could borrow?  Something with a door that locks?"

Indy blinked.  "I don't think any of our doors lock.  Oh, except the
sugar chests in the trading hall, to keep the children out, but they'd
never fit in there.  Grappa?"

Grappa Gas started to shake his head, then snapped his fingers.  "What
about the tunnels?  We could put them in there and nail some boards
across to stop them running off."  He gestured at the salvaged timber
beside them.

"Tunnels?" Sergeant Dorbu asked.  He turned to Indy.  "What tunnels?"

In the end, he chose the same tunnel that Noxy had shown Thokmay the
day before.  As the two prisoners pried the old wooden grill off the
entrance under the watchful eyes of the sergeant, half a dozen of his
men, an equal number of villagers, and a gaggle of children, Noxy
debated telling someone---her mother, Sergeant Dorbu, *someone*---that
Thokmay had known the tunnel was there.  Why hadn't he told the
sergeant?  And had it been him out in the rain last night, or the
younger ranger?  He was a head shorter than his partner---maybe, in
the dark, she could have mistaken him for a boy?

The old wooden grill clattered to the ground.  "Right, in you go," Aft
growled.  He had been holding a spare piece of wood like a club while
the prisoners worked, clearly not trusting them not to bolt or the
rebel soldiers to stop them if they did.

The older ranger spoke for the first time.  "What about the
necessaries?"

"We'll get you a bucket," Sergeant Dorbu.  "And something to eat."  He
cocked an eyebrow at Indy.  "And maybe a couple of blankets?"

"Yes, respected---and will you want some feather pillows to go with
them?"  she replied, but she smiled as she said it.

The two captured soldiers lifted a salvaged beam for Grappa Gas to
nail into place.  The older captive watched him bang the first couple
of nails into place, then snorted and looked away.  "What?" the
cloudherd asked.

"Didn't say anything," the royalist muttered.

Grappa Gas put his hands on his hips.  "Well, you didn't say it pretty
loudly.  You mind speaking up?"

The soldier shrugged.  "Just don't like seeing a job done poorly, is
all," he said, his lowland accent turning 'seeing' to 'saying' and
'all' to 'ale'.

"Don't like---it's just nailing, man!" Grappa Gas blustered.  Some of
the villagers hid smiles, knowing how proud the old man was of his
handiwork.

The soldier shrugged again.  "Don't mind me, I'm just here to hold the
heavy stuff."

"Hmph!"  Grappa Gas placed the next nail and lined up the hammer with
exaggerated care.  As he swung it back, the soldier snorted again.
The hammer came down squarely on Grappa Gas's thumb.

"Ow!  Rot and damnation, man!"  Grappa Gas stuck his thumb in his
mouth, glaring at the soldier.  "That hurts!"

"Leave him be," the younger soldier said.  "Worse he does, the sooner
as we're quit of here."

"Right, that's it."  Grappa Gas strode forward and held out the
hammer.  "You're so crafty, you show us how it's done."

The soldier glanced at the hammer, then at Sergeant Dorbu, who spread
his hands.  "As long as the job gets done," he said, struggling to
keep a straight face.  Some of the villagers weren't even struggling
any more, and Aft was grinning outright at his father's embarrassment.

The soldier shrugged once more.  "Sure.  Here, you take this."
Grunting, the two men swapped places.

"A little higher.  Yup.  That's it.  Nope, in closer to the wall.
Hold it."  The soldier eyed the beam's position critically.  "Good
enough."

And with no more warning than that he spun around and swung the hammer
at Sergeant Dorbu's head.  The sergeant barely flung his arm to block
the blow. *Thud!* The hammer made an ugly meaty sound as it connected
with his forearm.

At the same instant, the younger soldier flung his end of the beam at
Aft.  Aft jumped back with a curse so that the beam clattered to the
ground at his feet instead of crushing his toes.  "Run!" he shouted
needlessly as the older soldier charged through the crowd.

Someone shrieked.  Grappa Gas yelled, "After him!" and took two steps
before stumbling and falling to his knees, having forgotten about his
wooden leg for the first time in twenty years.

Two of the rebel soldiers were already running after the escaping
prisoner.  The younger one feinted left, then lunged right to go in
the opposite direction.  Without thinking, Noxy stuck out her foot.
"Oof!" The soldier sprawled facelong on the ground.  "Owf!"  Aft
landed on top of him.

The two scrabbled for a moment in the dirt before the soldier suddenly
relaxed.  "I yield!" he said.  "I yield, damn it!  Get off me!"

"Like hell," Aft grunted, twisting the soldier's arm up behind his
back.  He got up on one knee, then rose to his feet without relaxing
his grip.  "What do you want done with him?"

Sergeant Dorbu was cradling the arm that had taken the hammer blow.
His jaw was set and his eyes cold.  "Put him in the hole," he said
curtly.  "You!"  He nodded at Noxy.  "Get to the gate.  Tell whoever's
there what's happened, but keep your distance, you hear?  Don't try to
stop him."

"What?" Indy exclaimed.  "Wait!  She's not a---" But Noxy was already
gone.

The escaped soldier had gone back the way they had come, through the
village.  The path at the base of the wall was longer, but Noxy knew
it like her tongue knew her teeth.  She vaulted over a crate someone
had left out through the winter, skidded on a cobblestone that was
still crusted with winter ice, dodged around Sensy's startled granna
and grappa with a shout of, "Look out, he's escaped!", and practically
flew into the narrow jitty between their house and their neighbors.

Her boots splashed in a puddle left behind by the previous night's
storm.  As she burst out the other end, she plowed straight into
Thokmay and knocked him off his feet.

"Sorry!" Noxy exclaimed, reaching down to help him back to his feet.
"Did you hear?  One of the soldiers escaped!  We've got to tell
whoever's at the gate!"

"Go ahead," Thokmay gasped, waving her on as he tried to re-fill his
lungs.  "I'll catch up."

That was all Noxy needed.  She raced along the side of the trading
hall and sprinted across the square to the gate.  Three soldiers were
standing there, two on their own feet and one on crutches.  She
quickly explained what had happened.

"Hasn't come by here," the one on crutches said.  He had a single
yellow ribbon around his sleeve, and a thick bandage wrapped around
his shin.

"Yet," another added grimly, drawing his sword and hefting it in his
hand.  "Best for him he doesn't, either."

Boots clomped on the cobblestones as Thokmay trotted up to join them.
"Is there any other way out?" he asked Noxy.

She shook her head.  "Not unless he can fly."  She hesitated.  "But if
he finds some rope, and gets up onto the wall, he might be able to
climb down."

Thokmay nodded.  "I'll find Kulbinder and warn him," he told the three
soldiers.

"I'll come with you," Noxy said hurriedly.

"No!" Thokmay told her.  "It's too dangerous."

Noxy stared at him in disbelief.  "Too dangerous?  I know the forest a
lot better than you do!"

Thokmay patted the sword at his hip.  "And I know a lot more about
fighting than you do."

"Take her with you," the soldier on crutches ordered.

"But---"

"That's an order," the soldier said sternly, pointing at the ribbon
around his sleeve.

"Yes respected," Thokmay replied woodenly.  Without looking at Noxy,
he said, "Lead the way."

The air was colder and damper in the forest gloom.  Noxy rubbed her
arms to warm them as she walked.  Thokmay didn't seem to mind.  *But
he wouldn't with that thick coat on,* she thought sourly.  It didn't
look like it had gotten wet the night before, but if he'd been wearing
a rain cape...  And it would have had plenty of time to dry if he'd
hung it up near one of the big fireplace stoves in the trading
hall---their thick stone sides stayed warm all night.

Thokmay raised a hand.  "Hold."  He pointed the forest floor in front
of them.  "This must be where they fought.  See where the branches are
broken?"

"If you say so," Noxy said, rubbing her arms more vigorously.
Cloudherds learned how to read the sky almost before they learned how
to read books, but woodcraft was mystery to her.  Truth be told, she
had never really liked being in the forest.  The trees always seemed
to loom over her.  It wasn't too bad when the birds were singing, but
when it was silent---

"Why is it so quiet?" she asked, suddenly realizing that she hadn't
heard anything for the last hundred heartbeats except the soft
pitter-pat of water dripping from the branches around them.

"Sh..."  Thokmay made a cutting gesture with his hand.  "Something's
watching us."

Noxy shivered.  "Is it the tiger?" she whispered.  She glanced over
her shoulder.  They were only a couple of hundred strides from the
fortress gate, but it felt like home and sunlight and safety were a
world away.  The forest didn't want them there.  It didn't want their
voices or their boots or the short sword that was suddenly in
Thokmay's hand.

She pressed the heels of her hands to her temples.  What was
happening?  She couldn't be mind-hearing the forest---could she?  She
must be going crazy.  It was too much---it couldn't all fit.  Her head
was going to burst.

"It's too big..." Noxy whimpered.  

"Sh!" Thokmay hissed urgently.  "Be quiet!"

Noxy put a hand on a nearby tree to steady herself.  The bark was cold
and damp but reassuringly solid.  The little beads of sap under her
palm were frozen nearly solid but still sticky.  She took a deep,
shaky breath.  She wasn't going to throw up after all.  "I'm all
right," she told Thokmay, smiling weakly.  "Just...  just a headache."
Somewhere nearby, a sapsucker chirped uncertainly.  A squirrel
chattered in response, and from right behind her, a tiger spoke.

"What are you doing here?" Kulbinder demanded.  Noxy shrieked and spun
around.  The tiger ignored her.  "You should be in the village!"

"One of the prisoners escaped, respected.  The older one.  Took a
hammer to the sergeant, but he'll be all right.  He's probably still
inside the walls, and Corporal Choegyal at the gate is watching for
him."

The tiger growled.  "I've seen nothing.  But you were foolish to come
here."  He glanced at Noxy.  "And doubly foolish to bring her."

Noxy opened her mouth to protest that he hadn't brought her, she had
volunteered.  An all-too-familiar twinge in the back of her head
stopped her.  She looked up, but could only see a few tiny patches of
blue.  "We should hurry," she told the others.  There was a cloud
coming---a big one---and it was moving fast.

## Chapter 8: Royalty

The first thing the soldiers at the gate told Kulbinder was that the
escaped royalist was still missing, but hadn't come by them.  The
second was that Sergeant Dorbu's arm hadn't been broken, but it would
be a while before he could swing a sword properly.

"Remain here," Kulbinder ordered the soldiers.  "I will hunt for the
prisoner.  You."  He twitched an ear at Thokmay.  "You have chores, do
you not?"

"Yes, respected."  Thokmay and the other soldiers saluted the tiger's
hindquarters as he padded away.

As he disappeared around a corner, Noxy cleared her throat.  "Um, I'd
better go see if my *amma* needs me."

Thokmay nodded.  "I hope you're feeling better."  He saluted the other
soldiers and headed for the trading hall.

Noxy made a beeline for the wall stairs.  Once up on the parapet, she
scanned the horizon.  There!  The cloud was still so small that she
could have covered it with her thumb, but it was definitely headed
toward Stale.

She found her mother by the tunnel entrance, watching while Grappa Gas
hammered a beam into place.  The younger prisoner sat inside on a
blanket, spooning cold rice into his mouth from a bowl.  Sergeant
Dorbu and Aft were gone, but four extra soldiers stood with the two
holding the beam in place.

Noxy put her hand on her mother's arm.  "*Amma*, there's a cloud
coming.  It'll be here soon."

Indy frowned.  "Who is it?"

Her daughter shook her head.  "I don't know, but it's big.  *Really*
big."

Her mother shook her head despairingly.  "There's never just one
raindrop, is there?  All right.  Go find Aft and your granna.  And
the sergeant too, if you can find him.  He and his men are---oh!"  She
jumped as Kulbinder landed on the ground beside her with a sound like
a wet blanket falling on a floor.

"Sergeant Dorbu is searching the tannery," the tiger said, his ears
back and his tail bristling.  "The smell is truly disgusting.  If the
prisoner is in there, he is welcome to it.  Now, what is this about
raindrops?"

Fifteen minutes later, a small crowd stood on the mounting platform
watching the cloud approach.  Sergeant Dorbu and Kulbinder were front
and center, but a trio of soldiers with bows had split off to take
positions overlooking the canyon.  When Indy and Grappa Gas protested,
the sergeant cut them off.  "They won't do anything unless I tell them
to," he said.  "And I won't tell them to unless it's absolutely
necessary."

"Since when do you get to decide what's necessary?" Grappa Gas
demanded.

"Since someone disappeared without a trace in a village the size of a
bathtub," the sergeant shot back.  Then he shook his head and said,
"I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said that."

The cloud descended as it approached.  The soldiers on the platform
loosened their swords in their scabbards.  Grappa Gas rapped his
knuckles against his wooden leg, three and two, three and two, until
Indy quietly asked him to stop.  Below them, Big Blue and Pillow
stirred restlessly, pushing themselves from one side of the pen to the
other as the strange cloud approached.

Noxy closed her eyes and tried to slow her thumping heart.  After what
had happened in the forest, she was scared to try to mind-talk at all,
much less to a cloud she didn't know.  She jumped a little when her
mother gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.  "Don't worry," Indy said
softly.  "Everything's going to be all right."

Noxy nodded.  The cloud was about to disappear behind the spurs and
ridges that rose above the pass.  She closed her eyes again.  That
grumbling mind-mutter was Big Blue.  And that---that must be Pillow.
So the newcomer was...

Her eyes shot open as Aft cursed, "Rot and ruin.  It had to be him,
didn't it?"

"But who's he carrying?" Grappa Gas, shading his eyes.

"Who's 'he'?" Sergeant Dorbu asked.

Aft's mouth twisted.  "His name's Tasteless.  But you might as well
just call him trouble, because he always is."

The cloud bumped against the mounting platform a minute later.
"Canaries---reeee... spect!" Sergeant Dorbu bellowed in a parade
ground voice.  As one, the assembled soldiers thumped their fists to
their chests in salute.

"Why thank you!"  The bandy-legged man who hopped down from the cloud
sketched a bow.  "It's nice to finally get the welcome I deserve."

"It's not for you, you goof," Aft muttered.

The bandy-legged man's grin widened, but before he could answer,
another man stepped onto the platform and returned Sergeant Dorbu's
salute.  His close-cropped hair was shot through with gray, and his
face was as cold and as hard as the mountains around them.  Where the
sergeant had two ribbons sewn around his sleeve, the newcomer had
three yellow braids.  He returned the Angry Canaries' salute as half a
dozen other soldiers' dismounted beside him, their boots drumming on
the mounting platform.  They all wore spotless uniforms, and all had
the same stony look as their commander.

"Sergeant," the newcomer snapped.  "I trust the archers we saw coming
in are friendly?"

"Yes, colonel."

The colonel nodded.  "Good.  My men will be bringing them down."  He
glanced sideways.  "And the Gifted?"

"He's with us too, respected."  Sergeant Dorbu cleared his throat.
"May I asked, respected, what is---oh."  The soldier blinked rapidly,
then inhaled and bellowed, "Canaries---reeee... spect!" once again
as Her Highness Princess Shudarga, formerly *tral-tralpa* of the six
districts that made up the northern quarter of Gandan, now leader of
the rebellion, slid down off the cloud onto the mounting platform.

She was not much taller than Noxy, stocky and broad-shouldered like a
stonemason.  The golden thread in embroidered collar of office around
her neck gleamed against her dark skin.  When she smiled, her teeth
seemed as white as the snow-capped peaks around them.

"Well, this is a pleasant surprise," she said warmly.  "Colonel Bonzon,
could you introduce us please?"

"My apologies, Your Highness.  Sergeant?"

It shouldn't have been possible for Sergeant Dorbu to straighten up
any further, but somehow he managed it.  "Dorbu, respected, acting
commander of fifth troop, second regiment of ordinary foot.  This is
my second and chief scout, the Gifted Kulbinder, and the respected
Literally Indigestible, mayor of Stale Leftovers."

Indy bowed.  The rest of the villagers followed suit---even Grappa
Gas, though he hesitated one rebellious heartbeat before doing so.

The princess acknowledged their bows with a slight nod.  "And how, may
I ask, did the second regiment's fifth troop wind up here?  Aren't you
supposed to be in Chaghan?"

Sergeant Dorbu grimaced.  "About that, Your Highness..."

The villagers might as well not have been there as Colonel Bonzon and
the princess peppered Sergeant Dorbu with questions on the walk back
to Stale.  When he described the ambush, they asked about the makeup
of the royalist forces.  When he told them about being trapped by the
forest, and about the cloudherds rescuing their wounded comrades,
their questions were about the surviving men.  How many were fit
enough to march?  How many would be if they had another day or two to
rest?

And when he told them about the two royalist rangers they had
captured, and that one of them was on the loose, she didn't even break
stride.  "Colonel Bonzon will handle it, I'm sure," she said.

As short as the princess was, she moved briskly, and didn't seem fazed
at all by the thin mountain air.  Colonel Bonzon stayed beside her, his
hand never far from the hilt of his sword, while the half-dozen
soldiers that Noxy now realized were bodyguards kept pace ahead and
behind.  The villagers trailed behind like the tail of a comet, with
Grappa Gas stumping along at the rear, cursing quietly under his
breath as he tried to keep up.  The cloudherd Tasteless kept to the
back as well, either because he couldn't be bothered to rush, or
because he was prudent enough to stay as far away from Aft as
possible.

"Now, what about these trolls?" the princess asked.  "How aggressive
were they?"

"They're mostly not trouble at all, Your Highness," Aft broke in, all
trace of his usual belligerence gone.  "Not so long as we keep to
what's ours and don't disturb what's theirs."

"Good," she said crisply.  "And the forest itself?  How likely are we
to be able to get troops through to Chaghan?"

Sergeant Dorbu shook his head.  "Sorry, Your Highness.  A few rangers
might make it, but nothing more."  She pursed her lips at that, but
didn't reply.

The three archers Sergeant Dorbu had sent up the ridge were waiting at
the fortress gate when they arrived, watched over by twice their
number of the new arrivals.  The archers had the sullen look of
schoolchildren who have just been told their homework isn't good
enough and will have to be redone.  The princess's men had the same
close-trimmed beards and leathered skin of the royalist rangers.  They
all saluted as the princess and her entourage approached.

"Stand easy," she ordered.  "Mayor Indigestible, please let the colonel
know where the men can quarter, and where you'd like me to stay.
Colonel, I want a complete inventory in two hours---everything we still
have, everything we're missing.  And put out some patrols, not that I
need to tell you your job."  She yawned suddenly, then blinked as if
she was as surprised by it as everyone else.  "And mayor, if there's
any chance of a bath, I'd be eternally grateful."

"Of course, Your Highness," Indy said.  "My daughter and her friends
can lay one on for you right away.  But---" she hesitated.  "Forgive
me asking, Your Highness, but what are you doing here?"

Princess Shudarga looked at her bleakly.  "Running away.  The
rebellion is over.  We lost, and the only thing we can do now is live
to fight another day."

Stale's bath house was the second largest building in the village.
One third was the men's sauna, which Noxy had only been in once, on a
dare when she was eight.  The other two thirds held half a dozen tubs
lined with carefully-fitted sheets of slate.  Each one had a small
stove built into its side, topped with a boiler capable of holding
eight large buckets of water.  A squeaky pump at one end drew water
from the long pipe that snaked through the village carrying snowmelt
from the upper pond to the laundry sluices.

Or rather, that carried snowmelt in the warm months.  Sensy worked the
pump fruitlessly a few times before giving up.  "It must have frozen
again," she told Noxy with a frown.  "But it was working a couple of
days ago, and we've had rain since then, not snow."

Noxy shrugged.  "Maybe a baby bearfrog got stuck in it again."  She
nudged a nearby bucket half-heartedly with her boot.  "You stoke, I'll
carry?"

"You carried last time," Sensy pouted.

"Fine, I'll stoke," Noxy sighed, grinning behind Sensy's back as the
other girl picked up a pair of buckets.  There was plenty of kindling
in the box by the window---it was the first thing she had looked for
when they entered---and she had always loved starting fires.

The grin slipped from her face as she laid a few dry twigs in a
criss-cross pattern and tucked a few wisps of dry moss underneath
them.  If the rebellion was over, what was going to happen to rebel
soldiers?  And more importantly, what was happening to *her*?  As much
as she wanted to believe that what had happened in the forest had just
been lightheadedness or the beginnings of a fever, she knew something
more was going on.  Was she becoming a magician like her father?  Or
was she simply going crazy?  She needed to talk to someone, but who?

Something heavy thumped on the floor behind her.  A hand clamped over
her mouth as a strong arm wrapped around her, pinning her own arms to
her sides.  A low voice spoke in her ear, its owner's lowland accent
rounding the long vowels.  "I'm not going to hurt you, young miss, but
I'll need you to be keeping still."  It was the escaped ranger!

"Mmph!"  She struggled anyway, knowing it was hopeless---he was twice
her weight, and as strong as he was lean.  He stank of stale sweat,
woodsmoke, and most of all of urine.  He must have been hiding in the
tanning shed, she realized, her thoughts strangely calm.  It was the
one place where Kulbinder wouldn't be able to smell him.

She bent forward and snapped her head back as hard as she could.
There was a satisfying *crack!* the back of her skull connected with
his jaw.  "Here now!" he grunted, squeezing so tightly so that she
could barely breathe.  She didn't have to escape, she realized.  She
just had to hold on until Sensy got back.  The ranger couldn't hold
onto both of them at once.

The door opened.  The ranger spun around with Noxy still in his arms,
but it wasn't Sensy---it was Thokmay and Kulbinder.

The three humans froze, but not the tiger.  He bounded forward at Noxy
and the ranger with a roar.  She shrieked as the soldier pushed her at
the tiger and snatched up a stick of kindling.  Kulbinder knocked her
aside with his shoulder and pounced on the ranger.  He shouted
something unintelligible as he went down, his makeshift club bouncing
off harmlessly off the tiger shoulder.  There was an awful *crack!* as
the back of his head hit the lip of one of the bathtubs, and then he
was still.

"Go fetch Sergeant Dorbu," Kulbinder snarled. "*Now!*"

Noxy didn't need to be told twice.  She stumbled out the door and down
the steps just in time to collide with Sensy.

"Noxy, what's wrong?"

"The---he---in there," she gasped.  "Don't go in.  The prisoner,
he---the tiger---"  She suddenly realized she was crying.  When had
that started?

Sensy set her buckets down hastily, heedless of the water that sloshed
out of them onto her boots.  She took Noxy by the shoulders.  "Are you
all right?  What happened?"

"It's the soldier," Noxy explained, wiping her face on her sleeve.
"He was hiding, but then he grabbed me, and then the tiger came at
him.  We have to get my *amma*. And, and, the sergeant, and---"

Sensy's eyes widened.  "Come on!"  She tugged Noxy's arm.  Together,
the two girls ran through the village.

It was like kicking a beehive.  Noxy wasn't even a sentence into
stammering out what had happened before Indy pulled her into a hug and
Sergeant Dorbu and Colonel Bonzon were barking orders and running back
to the bath house with the other soldiers right behind them with
swords in their hands and Aft right there with them, yelling about the
back door to the bath house, someone should go around back in case
someone tried to escape that way.  Other soldiers ran for the trading
hall and Princess Shudarga, yelling at villagers to get out of their
way.

"Oh, daffodil," Indy murmured, squeezing her daughter almost as hard
as the ranger had.  "Oh, my beautiful girl, don't scare me like that."
*It wasn't **my** fault,* Noxy thought petulantly.  But she didn't say
it.  Instead, she just snuffled into her mother's coat and tried her
best to lose herself in her mother's arms.

Dinner that night was very different from the one the night before.
Indy, Granna Fee, and Grappa Gas put on their best clothes as if it
was Ancestor's Day and they were all going to give thanks together.
The villagers cleared the big table in the middle of the trading hall
and laid it with the carved Thindi teak cutlery that Aft's
great-granna had left the village as a memorial gift a century ago.
People coated slabs of goof's milk cheese with whatever spices they
could find and threw them into pans of marinade.

Noxy, Sensy, and Rash were pressed into service to round up children,
run frantic errands, and finally as servers.  Sensy and Noxy brushed
the tangles out of each other's hair and swapped tunics with each
other, then swapped them back.  "I don't know if I can do this," Sensy
said, fighting back tears.

Noxy gave her a quick hug.  "I don't either.  But look on the bright
side---for once, we won't be stuck looking after the littles."

Six sat down to dinner, Indy and the two elders from the village and
the princess, Colonel Bonzon, and Sergeant Dorbu in uniform.  "What's
taking so long?" Noxy muttered out of the corner of her mouth.  They
were standing with their backs against the wall next to the kitchen
door, waiting awkwardly as Aft put finishing touches on the evening
meal.  He had put himself in charge of preparations as soon as the
royalist soldier was safely nailed into the tunnel with his companion.
Noxy had no idea what he was doing---like most women in the village,
she was content to leave the cooking to the men---but the smell was
making her stomach rumble.

At the table, Grappa Gas carefully poured his best black *rak* into
small glasses and passed them to the village's guests.  "To your
health," he said, raising his to toast them.

"And to yours," Princess Shudarga said, raising hers in return.  "And
to hospitality.  Finding safe haven here was the first good thing to
happen to us in quite some time."

"So what happened, Your Highness?" Grappa Gas asked, settling back in
his chair.  "Last we heard before the sergeant here showed up, you and
yours had the upper hand."  From where she stood, Noxy could see the
kick her mother aimed at his good leg even if the princess and the two
soldiers couldn't, but Grappa Gas didn't flinch.

The princess didn't seem to mind his directness, though Colonel Bonzon's
eyebrows gathered like a pair of bull clouds getting ready to fight.
"We did.  The people understood what we were fighting for---we were
humbled by their support.  King Denpa's men understood as well, and
more took up our banner every day.  If we had pressed a little harder,
moved a little faster..."  She shook her head, her thoughts far from
Stale's one-story wooden trading hall.

"You wanted to save lives, Your Highness," Colonel Bonzon said.
"There's no dishonor in that."

The corner of her mouth quirked up in a brief half-smile.  "Thank you,
colonel, but I'm long past worrying about honor.  Yes, I wanted to save
lives.  I wanted to give the king's men a chance to see that we
weren't really fighting him, we were fighting rules that have us all
in shackles, nobles and commoners alike.  I wanted to give *him* a
chance to see the justice of our cause and step aside."  She sighed.
"But all I managed to do was give our neighbors time to realize that
if the Gandani stood up, it wouldn't be long before their own people
did too.  Nyengmo, Trunggar, Lhabde... The only one that didn't send
troops was Chaghan."

Grappa Gas nodded.  "So you're going into exile?  With these as your
honor guard?"  Noxy knew the look on his face.  It was the careful
lack of expression he wore whenever they were playing *shibo* and he
had just seen a winning combination.  She wondered if the princess
knew where his sympathies lay, then kicked herself mentally.  Of
course she would---Sergeant Dorbu would have told her.

The princess smiled a proper smile this time.  "There's that word
again, 'honor'."  She set her *rak* down carefully.  "It's a a
conjurer's trick, respected Gas, just like 'tradition'.  Those with
power made it up, then convinced everyone else it was real so that
they wouldn't wonder why the rules always seemed to run against them.
So no, these men aren't my honor guard.  They are my companions, and
my equals.  They don't serve me---we serve a greater cause, together,
and will do so until everyone in the Ninety Kingdoms has the law they
deserve."

Noxy suddenly realized she was holding her breath.  Princess Shudarga
hadn't raised her voice, but somehow she had filled the whole room as
she spoke.  Beside her, Aft stood transfixed, the first plate of
grilled cheese and vegetables forgotten in his arms, his eyes as wide
as a child's.

Grappa Gas cleared his throat.  "I see.  But you *are* all going to
Chaghan together?"

"We are," Colonel Bonzon said, his own glass of *rak* untouched in front
of him.  "Along with the rest of our men."

Grappa Gas leaned back in his chair.  "Really?  How are you going to
get them through the forest?"  He jerked his chin at Sergeant Dorbu.
"That didn't go so well last time."

Colonel Bonzon shook his head.  "We're not going to go through the
forest, respected.  You're going to fly us over it."

## Chapter 9: Choosing Sides

Stale woke to find itself under occupation.  Soldiers patrolled the
streets and the wall in pairs, Canaries paired with newcomers.
Villagers who ventured out were sent back to their homes, the soldiers
brushing aside protests about goofs that needed to be milked or
spiderwebs that needed to be dried and carded.

It was just a precaution, Sergeant Dorbu said, first to a stonefaced
Indy, then to an irate Grappa Gas, and then finally to the small crowd
that Colonel Bonzon finally agreed could gather in the square.  "But
just one person from each household," the sergeant had added
apologetically.  "Everyone else should stay inside for now."

"Precaution against what?" Grappa Gas demanded.  He was angrier than
Noxy had ever seen.  It wasn't the shouting rage he worked himself
into when he was arguing with his son.  This was as big as the
rainstorms that battered the mountains as autumn turned to winter.

Sergeant Dorbu looked the old man in the eye.  "Murder," he said.
"The two rangers we caught might be safely nailed up, but all it would
take is one arrow, and the rebellion really would be over.  The king's
men know that as well as we do."

"Never mind that---what's this foolishness about taking all of our
clouds?"  Where Grappa Gas's voice had been full of thunder, Granna
Fee's seemed made of iron.  She had used the same tone to explain to a
hapless soldier that just because she and Grappa Gas *happened* to be
coming out of the same house that morning *didn't* mean they were part
of the same household, and she would thank him *not* to jump to such
conclusions again.

"As the colonel said last night---" Sergeant Dorbu began.

"Some of us weren't invited last night!" one of the elders yelled.
Others murmured agreement.

"As Colonel Bonzon said last night," the sergeant continued doggedly,
"We have to get the army through to Chaghan.  We can't take them
through the Herd of Trees, not with two royalist regiments and half of
Lhabde's men blocking the entrance to the pass, so we're going to fly
them there."

"You mean *we're* going to fly them there!" Grappa Gas shouted.
"Well, rot that!  We've got *contracts*!  And even if we didn't,
there's farmers down in Gandan depending on us to bring them rain.  If
we go kiting off to wherever, folks are going to go hungry!"

"People are going hungry already."  The princess's voice cut through
the noise, instantly silencing the crowd.  Once again, Noxy wondered
if it was some strange kind of magic, or just a personality that was
three sizes larger than anyone else's.

People stepped aside to make a path for her as she walked to the
speaker's stone, nodding to Sergeant Dorbu as he stepped down to make
space for her.  She was dressed in a plain uniform jacket and kilt
without any marks of rank except the embroidered royal collar around
her neck.

The princess's gaze swept across the crowd.  "People are going hungry
every day," she said.  "And those who aren't live in fear that they
will, that someone with more money than they have will rent some law
they've never heard of and use it to take half their crop or throw
them off their land or have their house knocked down to to improve the
damned view.  You don't see it up here because you've learned to stand
together.  And that's what we need you to do now---stand together,
with us, so that we can keep fighting to put the law in your hands
where it belongs, so you can do what *you* want."

"And how in the rotting hell is that different from what you say
you're fighting?" Grappa Gas shouted, his dark face blotched with
rage.  "How's that different from the *tralpa* telling us we have to
fix up his roof for him and shear his goofs and stir some honey in his
tea because he's too damn lazy to get up out of his big fancy chair?
How much say do we get in this?"

"None," the princess said simply.  "I'm sorry, but this needs to be
done.  As soon as your fellow villagers bring your herd down from the
mountains, you're going to fly down to Duck Droppings to pick up my
men and take them through to Chaghan."

"And if we say no?" Granna Fee asked.

The whole village held its breath, waiting for the answer.  "Then we
will insist," the princess said wearily.  "I'm sorry---I truly
am---but what we are fighting for is bigger than any one village.  One
way or another, you are going to carry my army to Chaghan."

Noxy had always enjoyed math.  After watching her mother do the
village's accounts, she had pestered her grandmother into teaching her
how to add and subtract, and then multiply and divide.  When she was
nine, she had counted how many steps it took her to get from one place
to another in the village and written the numbers down in a small blue
notebook she had found in the bottom of a storage chest in the trading
hall at the end of the season.  She had even thought about becoming a
teacher like Granna Fee one day when her cloudherding days were over.

So as she walked home in silence beside Indy, she did a quick
calculation in her head.  Most of the adults had gone to round up the
village's herd of clouds.  That left about three hundred people in
Stale.  Two thirds of those were children, which meant there were no
more than a hundred villagers, versus almost able-bodied fifty
soldiers, all of whom had actually knew how to fight.  The odds would
change when the other adults came back, but Princess Shudarga was
right: she could insist, and there was nothing the Stalers could do
about it.

*Unless we run away,* she thought suddenly.  But how?  They couldn't
just walk away---the forest wouldn't let them, and with Kulbinder as a
tracker, the rebels would be able to find them in no time.  They
couldn't fly either---it would take half a dozen trips for Pillow and
Big Blue to carry everyone to safety, and they'd surely be caught
before everyone escaped.

"*Amma*," she started.

"Shush," Indy said quietly.  "We'll talk when we're home."

But they didn't.  Her mother nodded at every apprehensive villager
they passed , her best mayor's smile firmly fixed on her face, but
once they were inside and the door was closed, she slumped down at the
table and massaged her temples.  "Can you please make some tea,
daffodil?  I need to think."

"Yes, *amma*."  Noxy hefted the kettle.  Its gurgle told her that
there was enough water for two cups, so she wouldn't have to go back
out.  She stirred the embers in the stove and added a few strips of
kindling.  As she waited for the kettle to boil, she drummed her
fingers on her crossed arms.  She desperately wanted to ask her mother
what they were going to do, but it was clear that Stale's mayor didn't
know.

Someone knocked on the door.  "I'll get it," Noxy said as her mother
started to rise.

It was Sergeant Dorbu.  He had his helmet in his hands, and looked
almost as tired as Stale's mayor.  "Good morning," he said.  "May I
speak with your mother?"

Noxy stepped out of the way.  "*Amma*?" she asked.

Indy gestured at the chair across from her.  "Please," she said
woodenly.  "It's not like I can stop you."

The sergeant stood his ground.  "Yes you can.  I'm sorry that---"

"Did you know?" Indy interrupted, not bothering to try to hide the
hurt in her voice.  "When you first got here, did you know what her
plan was?"

Sergeant Dorbu shook his head.  "On my blood, I did not.  But that
doesn't matter.  I beieve in her, Indy.  She's the first person since
the Angels to stand up for people like us.  If this is what we have to
do to win, it's a small price to pay."

Indy finally looked at him.  "Easy to say when you're not the one
paying it," she said quietly.

Sergeant Dorbu was the first to look away.  "I'm sorry," he repeated.
With a nod to Noxy, he put his helmet back on his head, bowed, and
turned to leave.

Noxy closed the door as gently as she could.  "Kettle's boiled," she
said, and then she couldn't take it any more.  She rushed over and
threw her arms around her mother and buried her face in Indy's hair.
"It'll be all right," she said in a muffled voice.

Indy laughed shakily.  "I'm supposed to say that to you."  Then she
twisted around in her seat and wrapped her arms around Noxy.

Noxy remembered that cup of tea for the rest of her life.  She and her
mother talked about nothing and everything.  Should they replace the
shutter upstairs that always let in the breeze when the wind blew?
Definitely.  And had Indy ever told her daughter about the first time
someone proposed to her?  No?  Well, it was her second trip to
Nyengmo, and Grappa Gas had gone off to re-negotiate a contract for
rain, so she and two of her friends had found themselves free for an
afternoon...

Eventually Indy set her long-empty teacup aside and stretched.
"Well," she said regretfully, "I suppose I ought to go and see just
how much trouble we're in.  Why don't you head over to your granna's
and see if she needs a hand with anything?"

"All right."  Noxy stood up and put the teacups in the washbasin.
"But I'll have to make a stop on the way."

Stale's privies stood beside the tanning shed, on the theory that
everything that stank might as well be in one place.  A pair of
soldiers glanced at Noxy as she crossed the street, but said nothing.
When she was finished, she stepped back into the bright morning light
and then hesitated.  Granna Fee's was on the next street, but the
soldiers wouldn't know that, and she really wanted to talk to Sensy or
Rash or *someone* about everything that was going on.

So she turned right instead of left and walked back toward home.  As
she approached her front door, she glanced over her shoulder.  The
soldiers were still there, but were engrossed in conversation.  With a
quick sidestep, she ducked into the jitty between her house and the
neighbor's.

She stood for a moment, waiting for a shout from behind her.  None
came.  She let out her breath in a long, silent whoosh, then jumped as
a voice hissed, "What are you doing here?"

It was Thokmay.  He had been pressed against the wall---it wasn't
nearly enough to actually conceal him, but in the deep shadows that
filled the jitty, he had been just another patch of darkness.

"Me!? What are *you* doing here?" Noxy hissed back.  "Why aren't you
out there marching around with your friends?"

"They're not my friends," he said shortly.  "And they're not yours
either, not really.  Now keep quiet."  Without waiting for her angry
retort, he stepped up onto the piled-up cobblestones next to his feet
and reached into the gutter over his head.

"What are you doing?" Noxy demanded.

"Sh!"  Something clinked quietly as his fingers bumped into it.  He
cursed under his breath.

"Dont shush me!" Noxy said angrily.  "You tell me what's going on
right now, or I'm going to call the soldiers!"

"No you're not."  Noxy jumped again and spund around.  There, outlined
by the bright light from the street behind him, stood Kulbinder.  The
tiger's ears were flattened against his head, and his tail twitched
from side to side in a way that froze the breath in Noxy's lungs.

"Got it!" Thokmay whispered triumphantly.  The jitty was briefly lit
up by soft yellow light from a small piece of dayglass as he checked
his find.  Darkness returned instantly when he closed the lid on the
small metal box that held it.

"Good," rumbled the tiger.  He took a step toward Noxy.  She backed up
instinctively.  "Don't be afraid," Kulbinder said, making it sound
like a command rather than sympathy.  "We're not going to hurt you,
but we need an hour's head start, and we can't take any chances."

"Wh-what are you doing?"  Noxy asked again.  Her heart was pounding in
her chest.  She couldn't get past the tiger---she'd seen how quickly
he could run.  He'd pounce on her in an instant if she tried to knock
Thokmay down and run out the other way, and nobody was going to come
looking for her, not with the curfew.  She was trapped.

"We're going home," Thokmay said behind her.

"You're---you're deserting?"

"No." Thokmay's voice was quiet but sharp.  "We were never really
rebels in the first place."

"You're royalists?" Noxy gasped.

"He is," the tiger snorted.  "Cats don't partake of such foolishness."

"We got stuck in the middle of everything when Shudarga raised her
banner," Thokmay said.  "We went along with things as long as we
could, waiting for a chance to escape, but now we don't have a choice.
We have to reach the king's army and warn them what Shudarga is
planning."

"Warn them?  Why not just let her go?"

"Because she's not really taking her army to Chaghan," the young
soldier said impatiently.  "That's just what she's telling you all to
keep you quiet.  As soon as the clouds arrive, she's going to make you
carry her army right into the heart of Gandan.  She'll flood what she
can and put the rest to the sword."

Noxy turned to face him.  "My *amma* and the others would never do
that!" she said angrily.  "There are laws---cloudherd laws, not the
kind we have to rent from the *tralpa*.  We've never taken part in
lowlanders' wars, and we never will!"

But even in the dim light, Noxy could see the grim expression on
Thokmay's face.  "She's not going to give you a choice.  Once her
soldiers settle in, she's going to round up all of your children and
hold them hostage until you do what she wants."

Stunned, Noxy could only gape as he continued.  After dinner last
night, Princess Shudarga had talked strategy with Colonel Bonzon,
Sergeant Dorbu, and Kulbinder.  The princess had been the one to
suggest that they use the clouds to go on the offensive.  Sergeant
Dorbu had tried to talk her out of, saying that there was no way the
cloudherds would go along with.  That was when Colonel Bonzon had
proposed that they do to the cloudherds what the king had done to
them and their families.

"What did the king do?" Noxy asked, already knowing the answer.

"He rounded up the families of every officer who joined the rebels and
put them to work making arrows," Thokmay said.  "Any officer who
surrenders can take their place."

Noxy stared at him in disbelief.  "That's horrible!"

Thokmay's scowl deepened.  "He's only doing what he has to do."

"What he has to---now you sound like the princess!" Noxy thumped the
wall beside her with her fist.  "How come whatever you all do 'has to'
hurt someone else?"

"Sh!" Thokmay took a step toward her.  "The soldiers will hear you!"

"I don't---" Noxy bit back the rest of her sentence.  She wished he
had drowned in the fish pond.  No, she wished the soldiers had never
come to Stale, that the forest had devoured them or that they had
surrendered or Princess Shudarga had never rebelled in the first
place.  She wished she was riding a cloud and the only thing she had
to worry about was how long she was allowed to stay up there where she
belonged.

She wiped her face angrily.  "All right," she said.  "How do we stop
them?"

Thokmay looked at her blankly.  "What do you mean, stop them?"

"I mean how are we going to stop them?" Noxy repeated impatiently.
"The grownups will be back in two days, maybe three.  There's no way
you can get through the forest and get back here with the king's army
by then."  She raised a hand to forestall whatever Thokmay had been
about to say.  "And even if you could, they'd still have all of us as
hostages, or doesn't that matter?"

"So what do you propose we do?" the tiger asked.

Noxy's jaw set.  "Take some hostages of our own.  If we capture the
princess---"

"Hey!"  A hard voice shouted down the jitty.  "What are you lot doing
there?  Come out and show yourselves."

Noxy's heart leaped into her throat.  It was the soldiers---they'd
been found!

"It's all right, soldier, it's me," Kulbinder called out.  "I've just
found a little mouse.  I'll bring her out."

"What?" Noxy gasped.

"Just follow my lead," the tiger said quietly.  "And you," he
continued to Thokmay.  "Whatever happens, you must *not* let yourself
be seen."

"Yes, respected," Thokmay said with just a hint of sullen anger in his
voice.

Kulbinder shephered Noxy out of the jitty.  She blinked as the bright
morning sun dazzled her eyes.  The two soldiers standing there looked
annoyed rather than angry.

"What were you doing in there?" one of them demanded, drumming his
fingers on the hilt of his sword.

"Shirking chores," Kulbinder answered before Noxy could speak.
"Apparently it's as common here as it is everywhere else."

The second soldier nudged the first.  His fingers stilled, though his
scowl didn't lighten.  "All right.  Who do you belong to?"

"She's mine," Indy said in a cold, clear voice.  She was standing in
the door with her arms crossed and a scowl twice as dark as the
soldier's on her face.  She pointed at her daughter, then beckoned her
into the house.

Noxy gulped as convincingly as she could---which wasn't hard given the
look on her mother's face---and then glanced at the tiger.  "I think
you have some explaining to do," he said meaningfully.

"Yes, respected," she said meekly.  She kept her head down as she
stepped into the house, and only jumped a tiny bit as her mother
slammed the door closed behind her.

## Chapter 10: Rebellion

The first thing Indy said when Noxy finished telling her what had
happened was, "You can't tell Grappa Gas any of this---it'll throw him
right over the side."  Before Noxy could respond to that, she added,
"Or Aft.  You definitely can't tell him either.  Or your friends.  Oh,
rot."  She slumped down in her chair and swallowed a long, angry slurp
of cold tea.

"Yes, *amma*," Noxy said meekly.

Her mother banged her teacup back down on the table.  "And don't 'yes
*amma*' me.  It always makes me think you're planning something."

"Yes, *amma*," Noxy repeated in exactly the same voice.  Her mother
shot her a dark look, but then her scowl melted into limp smil.

In the end they turned to Granna Fee.  Noxy rummaged through the
pantry and packed whatever she could find into a pair of small wicker
provisions hampers while Indy drummed her fingers on the table and
thought.  Once the food was packed, they each took one and stepped out
into the mid-day light.

"For my mother," Indy explained to the first pair of soldiers they
saw, who just grunted and waved them on.  Noxy kept her head down,
telling herself over and over that nobody could actually *hear* her
heart thumping.

They passed a handful of other villagers on the short walk to Granna
Fee's.  Everyone had a destination---nobody was just out for an amble.
People greeted each other in lowered voices, but didn't stop to chat.
If soldiers were in sight, they didn't even slow down.

They had almost reached Granna Fee's before Noxy realized that she
hadn't seen or heard a single child.  Despite the warm sunlight,
Stale's elders were all keeping their grandchildren indoors.

They had to knock four times before Granna Fee answered.  When she
did, she practically dragged them inside before slamming the door
behind them.  She hugged them both, shushing their assurances that
they were all right.  "I know you are," she said crossly, her arms
still around them.  "But *I'm* not."

Her table was exactly the same size as the one in Indy and Noxy's
house.  It had been made by the same Uwsian carpenter, and been
brought back on the same cloud the summer that Indy was born.  The
nicks were in different places, though, and there was a round,
slightly shiny patch on one side that had been smoothed down by Noxy's
grandfather's elbow over the course of three decades.

Granna Fee fidgeted like a cat who smelled dinner cooking while Noxy
told her story.  "Well," she said brightly when her granddaughter
finished.  "That's going to be a problem, isn't it?"

"A problem?"  Indy and Noxy both jumped at the sound of Grappa Gas's
voice.  "A problem?  It's a rotting catastrophe!"  His wooden leg
clacked loudly on the stairs as he came thumping down dressed in a
nightshirt and fleece vest.

Granna Fee looked at Indy with something close to panic in her eyes.
"Oh, don't be silly," Indy said.  "Everybody knows."

"Knows what?" the old man growled as he kicked over a stool, then
righted it and sat down at the table.  "That this was going to be
trouble right from the start?  I *told* you---they're rebels!  If
they're going to turn on the king---the king!---why wouldn't they turn
on us?"  He banged his fist on the table, angrily shrugging off Granna
Fee's attempt to quiet him and oblivious to Noxy and Indy's amused
looks.

"Well, that's as may be," Granna Fee said, brushing back her hair and
carefully not meeting anyone's eyes.  "But we still have to decide
what we're going to do.  I mean, if they'd really take the littles
hostage..."

"I just can't believe Dorbu would do something like that," Indy
declared.  "I know we've only known him a few days, but---"

"But nothing," Grappa Gas cut in.  "He's a soldier, and he'll do what
he's told.  And if he won't, that corporal, what's his name,
Chogya---"

"Choegyal," Granna Fee corrected.

"Right, him.  If Dorbu won't do it, he will, and if *he* won't,
they'll just promote someone else."  His scowl deepend.  "Like it or
not, we're on our own."

"What about Tasteless?" Noxy asked hesitantly.  "Couldn't we---"

But the three grownups were already shaking their heads.  "I'd trust
Her Highness before I'd trust him," Granna Fee said firmly.

"Well then, what about the two soldiers in the tunnel?" Noxy continued
hurriedly before anyone else could speak.  "If they escaped, it
wouldn't be our fault if they brought the king's army back, would it?"
She trailed off, uncomfortable under the adults' stares.

"That might actually work," Indy said slowly.  "And if the tiger and
his boy help us..."  She exchanged looks with Grappa Gas and Granna
Fee, both of whom nodded reluctantly.

The mayor straightened up.  "All right.  Here's what we're going to
do..."

One of Indy's favorite sayings was that no plan ever survived its
first contact with real life, and so it was that day.  Noxy never had
to use the story she'd carefully rehearsed about needing to go down to
the fishpond to collect hairy turtle eggs for dinner---the soldiers at
the main gate just waved her through.  They were equally uninterested
in her when she returned with two dozen eggs in her hamper.  "I just
need to give these to everyone," she said brightly.  One soldier
grunted.  The others ignored her completely.

The eggs were long past edible, but they gave her an excuse to walk
through the village.  No matter where she went, though, she couldn't
find Kulbinder or Thokmay.  She was starting to think that they had
already made their escape when she heard the tiger's deep voice waft
past on a breath of wind.  She looked up, and her heart sank.  He was
up on the wall with Colonel Bonzon.

She did one more lap of the village before her nerve gave out.  The
soldiers were definitely look at her the second time she passed them,
and sooner or later, someone was going to notice that she still had
all the eggs she had started with.

This time, Granna Fee opened her door at the first knock.  Noxy
quickly explained what had happened.  When she was done, Grappa Gas
shrugged.  "Just means we do it without them," he said flatly,
scratching his stump before buckling his wooden leg back on.

"But---" Granna Fee started to protest.  Grappa Gas leaned over and
kissed her before she could go any further.

"Can't be worse than that trip we did down to Bhuntshorju," he said
gently.

Granna Fee goggled at him.  "But that's when the bearfrog bit your leg
off!"

Grappa Gas grinned.  "Right.  So it can't be worse than that, can it?"

They left the house in pairs.  Grappa Gas and Granna Fee turned right
toward the tunnel where the two royalist soldiers were being held.
Noxy and her mother went left, each carrying bundles of twigs taken
from the communal kindling pile outside Granna Fee's back door.  A few
more people were out, but the first time someone stopped to talk to
the mayor, a nearby soldier cleared his throat meaningfully and shook
his head.

"Keep your head down," Indy muttered.  "If you don't look them in the
eyes, they won't bother you."  Noxy nodded jerkily, making a mental
note to find out when and where her mother had learned that.

They reached the burned-out storage shed without incident.  They were
in luck---no one was was in sight.  While Noxy kept watch, her mother
ducked into the shed, untied her twigs, and quickly laid them in a
cross-hatch pattern.

"Still wet?" she asked her daughter.  Noxy nodded and passed her the
second bundle.  They had torn Grappa Gas's night shirt into strips,
soaked the pieces, and woven them through the twigs.  Noxy had been
afraid the whole way over that one of the soldiers would notice that
her bundle was dripping.

Indy laid the second bundle on top of her pile, then pulled a few
scraps of fire paper out of the top of her sock and tucked them in
among the twigs.  A flint and steel sparker materialized out of the
other sock and made a scraping sound as she twisted it.  Once, twice,
a third time, and a tiny dot of heat landed on the paper and caught.

Stuffing the sparker back in her sock, Indy leaned forward and
breathed gently on the spark.  It brightened and spread, eating a
bright-edged hole in the fire paper.  A moment later the twigs'
needles were alight, and then the twigs themselves.

"Come on," Indy said.  Noxy didn't need to be told twice.  A quick
look around the edge of the door told her that the coast was
clear.  She and her mother hurried away.

They were halfway between Granna Fee's and the makeshift tunnel prison
when they heard the first shout.  Noxy didn't dare look, but at a
second shout, Indy glanced over her shoulder, frowning, then crossed
the street to where a pair of soldiers were standing.  "Excuse me, do
you know what's happening?" she asked.

The soldiers shook their heads.  "No idea, respected," said the one
Noxy recognized as a Canary.

Indy's frown deepend.  "Wonderful," she said, her tone making it sound
anything but.  "I *am* still mayor, you know, and it would be nice if
people told me what was going on in my own village."

"I'm sorry, respected," the soldier said helplessly.  "I don't---"

A shrill whistle cut him off.  "Excuse me," he said.  His partner was
already jogging back the way Indy and Noxy had come.  The Canary
ducked his head and followed him.

This time Noxy risked a look.  A twist of gray smoke was climbing into
the air.  It thickened even as she watched.  *That'll be the rak,* she
thought.  Granna Fee hadn't been happy about sacrificing two whole
bottles of the thick, dark liquid, but she had been right about how
well it would burn.

She and her mother rounded the corner.  Noxy's heart sank.  There were
no soldiers in sight, but Aft was standing in front of the tunnel
mouth, hands on hips and nose to nose with his father.  Granna Fee was
frantically trying to get between them, but the two angry men were
having none of it.

"And *I* want to know what you're doing out when there's a curfew!"
Aft spat angrily.

"Don't take that tone with me, boy." Grappa Gas raised the hammer he
was holding and shook it at him.

Aft knocked the hammer away.  They were just about to start scuffling
when Indy said, "Stop it, both of you!"

Grappa Gas lowered the hammer.  Aft lowered his fists.  Indy lowered
her voice.  "What are you *thinking*?  The last thing we need is you
two butting heads like a couple of goofs!"

"Well then you should remind this buckethead whose side he's supposed
to be on," Grappa Gas snapped, unabashed.  He glanced over his son's
shoulder at the two prisoners, who were watching the proceedings with
unconcealed amusement.  "Playing soldier when his own people are
afraid to be out of their homes---it's a disgrace, that's what it is!"

"*I'm* a disgrace?"  Aft threw up his hands in disgust, almost
clouting Granna Fee on the chin by accident.  "*You're* the one
creeping around like some sort of thief.  Or were you planning to use
that hammer to dig up some daffodils?"

"Stop it!" Indy repeated sharply.  "Now listen to me---no, listen, not
talk."  She quickly explained what Noxy had heard and what they had
decided to do.

His face hardened as she spoke.  "I don't believe it," he said flatly
when she finished.  "Her Highness is on *our* side---on everyone's
side.  She wouldn't do something like that."

"So do you think I just made it up?" Noxy demanded angrily.

Aft shook his head.  "I don't think *you* are.  But what about the
tiger?  All we have is his word, and we have no idea what game he's
playing."  He jerked his thumb over his shoulder.  "Until we've got
something better than that, these two are staying right here."

"Why, you---" Grappa Gas stepped toward him, raising the hammer once
again.

This time it was Indy who stepped between them.  "That's *enough*!"
The scowl on her face was the same one she wore when someone cooked
something with cilantro, and she had to eat it to be polite.  "He's
right.  No, he's right," she continued, raising a hand to Grappa Gas.
"We need some way to check the tiger's story before we do anything
foolish."

She rounded on Aft.  "But your father is right too.  You shouldn't be
here doing the soldiers' work.  If they think they can set us against
each other, we're done for.  So we're *all* going to go home now, is
that understood?  We'll try to find out what's actually going on, and
until we do, we'll leave the soldiering to the soldiers."

Aft clenched and unclenched his fists.  "Fine," he said.  "But we all
leave together."

"Fine," Grappa Gas said in an equally disgusted voice.  With a mock
bow, he waved his son ahead of him.

The five villagers walked back up the street in silence.  At the first
corner, Aft grunted something that might have been, "Bye," and turned
toward his home.

Grappa Gas only made it another dozen steps before bursting out, "I
can't believe it!  You're the mayor, Indy, the *mayor*!  You shouldn't
let him talk back to you like that!"

"It seemed like the simplest thing," Indy said lightly.

Grappa Gas glanced at her.  "What are you grinning about?" he asked
suspiciously.

Indy looked at her mother, who was wearing an identical grin.  Granna
Fee spread her hands.  "Dear me," she said innocently.  "I seem to
have misplaced my hammer.  I suppose I must have dropped it while you
two big strong goofs were shouting at each other."

Grappa Gas gaped at her, then at Indy, and then started to laugh.

They ate dinner together, telling stories they'd all heard before but
enjoying them nonetheless.  Indy and Noxy walked home arm in arm as
the sun was setting, still smiling.  Indy even waved at a couple of
soldiers and wished them a good evening, though her expression froze
when she caught sight of Sergeant Dorbu in the distance.  They made
small talk as they washed their faces, changed into their night
shirts, and went to bed.  Noxy read a few pages by the yellow light of
her little shard of dayglass, but gave up and set her book aside the
third time she realized it had fallen closed in her hands.

She dreamed of clouds that night, of clouds flying free and of the
forest brooding below them.  Snowflakes tickled as they fell through
her, and the north wind felt like drinking an endless cold glass of
water.  She shouted for joy, then woke and realized that the shouts
were real, and not hers.

"*Amma*?" she called out blearily.  "*Amma*, what's going on?"  She
shrugged into the scratchy woolen sweater that Sensy had knit for her
as a Yearagain Eve present and stumbled downstairs.

Her mother was peering out the half-open front door.  She shushed Noxy
as her daughter joined her.  Four soldiers jogged by outside, swords
in their hands.  She heard Sergeant Dorbu shouting orders somewhere
nearby, telling someone to double-check the bath house and someone
else to make sure Colonel Bonzon had men searching the ridge above the
cloud pen, they could be hiding there waiting for daylight.

"Did they escape?" Noxy whispered anxiously.

"They must have," her mother whispered back.  "Stay here."  Before
Noxy could protest, Indy slipped out through the door.

Noxy hesitated only a moment before following her.  "Wait!" she
hissed.

Her mother spun around.  "Get back in the house!" she ordered.  "It's
not safe out here!"

Noxy crossed her arms.  "Well if it's not safe, you shouldn't be here
either, should you?"

Indy glared at her, but whatever she might have said next was cut off
by a sharp, "You! Hold!"

It was Sergeant Dorbu.  He jogged up the street to stop in front of
them with two of his men at his heels.  "Respected mayor, I need to
ask you to return to your home."

Indy snorted.  "That's what I was just telling *her*.  What's going
on?  Are we being attacked?"

The sergeant shook his head.  "No, respected.  The prisoners have
escaped somehow."  He searched her face.  "You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?"

This time it was Indy who crossed her arms.  "To tell you the truth, I
don't want to know anything about any of this any more," she replied
flatly.

Sergeant Dorbu looked away.  "I'm sorry, respected," he said.  "I
truly am.  But please---go back to your house and let us deal with
this."

Just then an angry voice bellowed, "Let *go* of me, or I swear I'm
going to knock you into next Bluesday!"  Two soldiers came around the
corner holding a furiously-struggling Aft between them.  Two others
marched alongside with heavy wooden cudgels in their hands.  All four
were newcomers, and all four looked as angry as Aft.

Indy rounded on Sergeant Dorbu.  "What in the names of all the saints
is going on here?" she demanded.

Sergeant Dorbu had already stepped into the middle of the road.
"Halt!" he said.  "Where are you taking this man, and on whose order?"

The soldiers halted.  One of the cudgel wielders thumped his chest in
salute.  "Colonel Bonzon's orders, sergeant.  We found a hammer in the
tunnel where the prisoners were being held.  Only time it could have
gotten there was when this man was guarding them on his ownsome."

Noxy's hand flew to her mouth.  Her mother's eyes widened.  She looked
at Aft in shock.  The expression his face said that he knew full well
how the hammer had gotten there.  He bared his teeth, and for a
heartbeat Noxy was sure he was going to say something.  Instead, he
snapped his head to the side, cracking his forehead against the nose
of one of the soldiers holding him.  "I said let *go* of me, you
rag-eared stack of goof dung!"

A sudden cudgel blow knocked the wind out of him.  He sagged,
wheezing, then made a sound that could only be described as a growl
and tried to straighten up.  The soldier who had hit him pushed the
end of his cudgel up against Aft's throat.  "Nuh uh," he cautioned.
"Not unless you want another one."

As the four soldiers hauled him away, Aft shot one more look at Indy
and the sergeant.  Noxy couldn't honestly have said which he seemed
angrier at, or which he thought had betrayed him the worst.

## Chapter 11: Flight

Stale woke up sullen and angry the next morning.  The tentative
goodwill that had been growing between the villagers and the Angry
Canaries had evaporated as word of Aft's incarceration spread across
backyard fences and in lowered voices as people milked goofs,
collected eggs from chicken coops, and took care of other essential
chores as quickly as they could.  Everyone moved with a sense of quiet
urgency, as if preparing for an early autumn blizzard.

Noxy was only half surprised when she interrupted Rash and Sensy in
the jitty between their parents' houses.  Her mother had sent her to
check and make sure Rash's grappa was all right---his mind had started
wandering during the winter, and she hadn't seen him the day before.
Head down, she almost walked past the jitty, but a quiet, "Uh oh!"
caught her ear.  She looked up and saw her two best friends standing
there, still holding hands, Rash looking embarrassed and Sensy
defiant.  She stared at them and they stared back until Noxy's mind
caught up with her eyes and she said, "Um, how's your grappa doing?"

Rash cleared his throat.  "Fine.  He's sleeping a lot, but he's fine."

Noxy nodded.  "Good."  And then she repeated, "Good," putting all the
certainty she didn't feel into her voice before setting the small box
of food she was carrying on his house's stoop and turning around to go
home.

She barely saw the soldiers she passed on the way.  Kulbinder's deep
voice from around the next corner brought her back to the world.  "Of
course, respected, as soon as he's back, but I---"

"And when will that be?" Colonel Bonzon interrupted sharply.  "Her
Highness wants to review *all* her troops, *today*, whether it's
convenient for them or not."

Noxy glanced over her shoulder.  The nearest soldiers were three
houses away, and looking in the other direction.  Heart suddenly
pounding, she put her foot up on the steps of the nearest house and
bent over as if tying her bootlace.

"Of course, respected," Kulbinder replied calmly.  "He should be back
this afternoon.  If you would like, I could go to fetch him right
now."

"Do that," the colonel ordered.  "And make sure he's presentable.  Her
Highness is *not* happy about you letting the prisoners get away, and
having your boy show up looking like an unwashed beggar will *not*
improve her mood."

"Understood, respected."

Noxy kept her head bent as the colonel's bootsteps faded into the
distance, then jumped when Kulbinder padded around the corner and
asked, "Did you catch all of that?"

"A-all of what?" she asked, straightening up.

"My conversation with the good colonel," the tiger said impatiently.
His tail twitched.  "He wants Thokmay to be in his little parade this
afternoon for Her Highness, but we can't let that happen."

"Why not?"

The tiger's tail twitched again.  He seemed to reach a decision.  "Go
home," he ordered.  "Put as much food as you can in a small
bag---dried fruit, cheese, a blanket, whatever else you need for
travel.  Meet me back here in half an hour, and don't tell anyone
except the mayor what it's for."  Before Noxy could say that she
couldn't tell anyone because she didn't know herself, the tiger
trotted away.

Her mother wasn't home when Noxy got there.  She dithered for a few
dozen heartbeats, torn between common sense and the need to do
something---anything, so long as it wasn't sitting and waiting for who
knew what.  Then she muttered, "Stop being stupid," and grabbed the
travel pack that Indy and Granna Fee had given her as a Yearagain
present that winter.  It was made of dark blue canvas, with a light
blue lining infused with wax to keep things dry.  She had spent New
Year's morning wrapped in a blanket in front of the stove, daydreaming
about what her first cloudherding trip would be like as she explored
its pockets, flaps, and ties, completely oblivious to her mother and
grandmother's fond looks.

Cheese, dried fruit, a hard bread called *nak* that had to be soaked
in tea before it could be chewed (and even then, there was always a
risk of cracking a tooth)... Her little shard of dayglass, carefully
wrapped in a thick pair of socks, went in on top, and then the little
doctressing kit that Indy always kept at hand.  She hefted the pack to
check its weight, shrugged into her coat, and hurried out the door.

It wasn't until she passed the first pair of soldiers that she
realized she had no way of explaining why she was so obviously dressed
for travel.  What would she say?  How would she explain the supplies
in her pack, never mind the heavy work knife tucked hanging from her
belt?  She had put it on without a second thought, not thinking until
just now that anyone who didn't know how much hard work cloudherding
was, it would look like a weapon, not a tool.

She crossed the narrow street and picked up a pot full of greenflags
that someone had set out as a springtime decoration.  The ragged
rectangular blooms had started to wilt, but if anyone asked she would
say that she was, she was, she didn't know what but she'd think of
something.

Kulbinder was nowhere to be seen when she reached the corner where
they'd spoken.  She set the pot down and wiped her forehead with her
sleeve, only half-pretending to be out of breath.  The pot was heavier
than it looked, and her coat was too warm for heavy work.

"Psst!  Over here!"  Thokmay beckoned to her from a jitty on the other
side of the street.  Leaving the pot where she'd set it down, she
crossed the street and stepped into its shadows.

"Is that all you brought?" he asked, looking at her pack.

Noxy bristled.  "That's all anyone ever takes."

"And I thank you for it," the tiger rumbled from behind her.

Noxy whirled around.  "Stop *doing* that!" she hissed.

The tiger blinked.  "Doing what?"

"Sneaking up on people!  I almost---oh, never mind.  Here."  She
turned back to Thokmay and opened the pack, anger making her fingers
clumsy.  "There's bandages and burn salve, and a bit of dayglass in
the socks---it's probably got about a couple of hours in it, but it's
not very bright.  The rest is food."

She re-tied the pack and held it out to Thokmay.  As he reached out to
take it, a gruff voice said, "Hold there!"

Noxy whirled around again.  There in the entrance to the jitty stood
one of the princess's soldiers, his sword in his hand.  Another
soldier stood behind him.

Kulbinder growled as the first soldier took one step forward.  "Easy
there, respected," the soldier said, patting the air with his free
hand.  "Easy there..."

"What is the meaning of this?" the tiger snarled.

"I was going to ask you the same question."  A chill ran up Noxy's
spine at the cold threat in the speaker's voice.  The second soldier
was Colonel Bonzon.

"No!" Thokmay said to Kulbinder from behind her, but it was too late.
The tiger bounded forward and threw himself at the hapless soldier,
knocking the soldier's sword aside with one swipe of his paw.

His full weight hit the soldier in the chest.  Shouting a curse, the
soldier tumbled backward into Colonel Bonzon.  "With me!" the tiger
roared, lunging at the first of two more soldiers behind the colonel.
"Now!"

"Go!" Thokmay shouted, shoving Noxy forward.  "Go go go!"  Then they
were running, out of the jitty and into the street where the first
soldier and Colonel Bonzon were already back on their feet and another
soldier was down on his knees, clutching his bloodied hand while his
partner swung at the tiger.  Kulbinder ducked under the blow and spun
around to knock the colonel off his feet again, roaring, "Run, boy,
run!"

Noxy and Thokmay ran.  Down the street, around the corner to---no,
there were soldiers there, drawing their swords at the sound of
shouting.  "This way!"  Noxy dodged around Thokmay and ducked into the
jitty beside Rash's house.  Her boots splashed in a puddle and she was
back in daylight, still running, the pack bouncing on her shoulder.

"What---?" squawked an elder as Noxy plowed into her, knocking her
armload of dried moss into the air.

"Sorry!" Noxy shouted over her shoulder.  There!  She took the steps
to the bath house two at a time, yanked the door open, said, "Excuse
me!" to the two half-dressed old men who gaped at her and Thokmay,
yanked the back door open, and slammed it shut behind them.

"We have to get outside the walls," Thokmay panted.

"What do you think I'm trying to do!?" Noxy snapped, equally out of
breath.  She pointed at the pile of firewood stacked against the side
of the bath house.  "Up that."

The quartered logs and kindling shifted under their feet as they
clambered up the woodpile.  Thokmay grabbed the bath house gutter and
tested it with his weight before pulling himself up onto the roof.
Noxy had just pulled herself up behind him when the door burst open.

She froze, not even daring to breathe.  "Clear back here!" a soldier
called.

"I *told* you we didn't see anyone," quavered an elderly voice from
inside the bath house.  The door slammed shut beneath her.

Noxy realized she was shaking.  She looked over at Thokmay, who was
standing with his boots on the gutter and his body pressed against the
steep shingled roof.  "What now?" he hissed.

*Doom doom!*  *Doom doom!*  Stale's home drum echoed off the ancient
fortress walls.  "Oh, wonderful," Noxy muttered.

"What *now*?" Thokmay hissed again.

"I'm thinking!" Noxy snapped.  But even as she said it, an idea took
shape.  She closed her eyes and reached with her mind.

"What are you doing?" Thokmay demanded.  "We have to get moving!"

"Just wait!"  There!  Her lips moved, then she opened her eyes.  "Come
on!"

Children were absolutely, positively *not* allowed on the village's
roofs, which of course meant that Noxy and her friends had found a
dozen opportunities to do just that.  The trick was to walk sideways
like a rock crab, using your hands like an extra pair of feet, and to
not look down, especially not in those heart-stopping moments when one
house ran out and you had to stand up straight and run for a couple of
steps and leap across a jitty to the next roof.

Noxy kept them close to the south wall, out of sight of the other
three, but even so, every moment she expected to hear someone yell,
"There they are!" from above them.  They froze once at the sound of
shouting below them, but it was just a soldier ordering some villagers
back into their home.  They froze again when Noxy's foot hit a loose
shingle and sent it skittering over the roof's edge to land in a
bucket or barrel with a quiet *sploosh!* that only they noticed.  Then
they were moving again, hands and coats and knees made filthy by
scraping against damp muck and moss, legs starting to tremble from the
strain.

It felt like it took forever to reach the end of the row of houses,
though it was probably only a couple of minutes.  The stairs to the
Quick Tower were close enough to jump to, but only just---Noxy had
managed it, but any bragging she might have done had been silenced by
Rash's broken leg.  And she hadn't been wearing a pack at the time.

She tightened its straps.  "Just follow me," she told Thokmay.  Before
her nerve could fail, she straightened up, took three long steps, and
threw herself across the gap to the stairs.

The toe of her right boot clipped the side of the steps.  She tumbled
forward onto the stone, cracking her knee, and scrambled to her feet
just in time to see Thokmay land sure-footed on the step below.

"There they are!"  This time the shout wasn't in her
imagination---they had been spotted!

"Come one!" she yelled.  She sprinted up the steps, desperately hoping
that no one was waiting for her at the top, that the soldiers were all
busy hunting for them down below, that---

Her hopes were half answered.  The soldiers weren't at the top of the
steps---they were halfway along the wall, but they had bows, and the
princess was with them.  Her mouth fell open as they drew and aimed at
her.  *They're going to shoot me!* she thought stupidly.

"Hold!" the princess ordered, raising her hand.  Then Thokmay reached
the top of the stairs and her eyes widened in surprise.  "Prince
Thokmay?  What are *you* doing here?"

He didn't get a chance to answer.  *Twang!* A bottle of *rak* with a
burning rag stuff in its neck flew through the air and shattered
against the stones just a few strides from Princess Shudarga.  "Stick
*my* son in a cage, will you?" Grappa Gas bellowed, loading a second
bottle into his slingshot as the first burst into flame.

One of the archers let fly.  His arrow thunked into the window frame a
handspan from Grappa Gas's head just as the old man loosed his second
shot.  *Twang!* The bottle shattered next to the first, sending a
fresh burst of flame into the air.

"What are you waiting for!?" Grappa Gas yelled.  "Go! Go! Go!"

Noxy's arms and legs unfroze.  Grabbing Thokmay by the arm, she turned
and ran along the parapet.  Behind them, soldiers leaped through the
flames and gave pursuit, shouting for help.

An arrow flew past her with a sound like someone blowing breath in her
ear.  She shrieked and kept running.  *Thunk!* Another suddenly
sprouted from the wooden steps of the firewatch tower in front of her.
*Thunk!* A second one hit beside the first.  They were warning
shots---the archers could hit them any time they wanted.  But it was
too late to think about that.  She took the firewatch tower steps two
at a time, grabbed the rope lying coiled at the base of the flagpole,
and heaved it over the wall.

The rope burned her hands as she slid down.  It didn't reach the
ground, not nearly, but there was nothing she could do about that
now.  She let go.  For one sickening heartbeat she was falling.  Then
the ground punched her feet and her knees folded up and her backside
hit the ground hard enough to jar her teeth but she was all right, she
could roll to the side and stand as Thokmay slithered down the rope
and landed beside her with a thump and a curse.

"Let's go!" she said, grabbing his arm again.

"No!"  He shook her off.  "I'm not leaving without Kulbinder."

"There they are!" someone shouted from the wall above them.  She
looked up to see a soldier pointing at her.  Her heart sank at an
answering shout from around the corner of the wall.

"Come *on*!" she yelled.  Thokmay swallowed another curse and followed
her.

Branches slapped at their faces as they crashed down the narrow,
twisting path through the forest.  Shouts behind them were answered by
others ahead---the princess's soldiers were already at the cloud pen.

Noxy pulled up short.  "Wait!" she ordered, raising a hand to quiet
Thokmay before he could speak.  She closed her eyes and reached with
her mind again.  There!

She opened her eyes.  "This way," she pointed.  She pushed through a
patch of fangberry, ignoring the tiny flowers as they snapped and
snarled at her, and slid down the steep slope toward the mouth of the
cloud pen canyon.

The forest stopped abruptly just a few strides short of the dropoff.
As they burst out of the trees, the only things that stood between
them and the edge of the canyon were a few snowberry bushes, a fallen
tree that someone had rolled into place to use as a bench, and
Sergeant Dorbu with a panting pair of soldiers with swords drawn.

Thokmay and Noxy skidded to a halt.  The sergeant raised his hands.
"Easy there," he said, as if calming a frightened horse.  "Easy...  No
one's going to hurt you.  We just---"

Kulbinder burst out of the trees behind them with a roar.  The
bleeding gash on his flank and the matching cut on his skull only made
him more terrifying.  He threw himself at the soldiers as Sergeant
Dorbu cursed and drew his sword.  One swipe of his paw, and the first
soldier was on the ground.  The second soldier's blade whistled over
his head.  Another quick swipe and the second soldier was down beside
the first, clutching the fresh wounds on his calf.

"Stop!  Kulbinder, stop!" Sergeant Dorbu shouted, hefting his sword.

The tiger stalked forward one pace, then another, his tail twitching.
"Put it down, sergeant," he growled.

Sergeant Dorbu shook his head.  "I can't do that."  He set his feet in
a fighter's stance and raised his blade.

"Wait!"  Noxy threw herself between them.  "Just wait!"

"Out of the way, girl," the tiger growled.

Noxy shook off Thokmay's hand.  "Just wait," she repeated.

"We can't!" Thokmay shouted.  "If we stay here they'll catch us!"

"We're not staying here," Noxy said.  And then she grabbed his arm and
pulled him with her as she jumped off the cliff.

They both screamed as they fell.  One, two, three... Big Blue dimpled
under their weight as they landed on the cloud.  The impact knocked
the wind out of Noxy.  She rolled over and struggled to her knees just
in time to be tumbled onto her back again as Kulbinder hit the cloud
just a stride from its flank.  She caught a momentary glimpse of
Sergeant Dorbu staring in disbelief as Big Blue rose into the sky to
carry them away.

"Are you mad!?" the tiger demanded.  "You could have killed him!"

"You're welcome," Noxy spat back.  She shrugged out of the pack and
threw it down beside Thokmay, who was still struggling to get to his
feet.  "Now shut up and let me steer."  *And please don't ask how I
mind-spoke to the cloud from so far away,* she added silently.

The net across the cloud pen entrance was half-open, just as Big Blue
had told her.  Pillow and the big cloud that Tasteless had arrived on
circled nervously as Big Blue flew through it.  *North,* Noxy told
him.  *Go fast.*  As the wind of their passage began to strengthen,
she opened her eyes and turned to Thokmay and Kulbinder.  The young
man had pulled bandages out of her pack to press against the wound on
the tiger's flank.

"So," she said.  "Would you like to tell me what's really going on?
And don't say, 'What do you mean?', because I heard what the princess
said.  She called you 'Prince Thokmay'."

The tiger and his boy exchanged looks.  The tiger blinked first.
"Probably Noxious of Stale Leftovers," he said formally, "Allow me to
introduce you to His Royal Highness Prince Thokmay, heir to the throne
of Gandan."

## Chapter 12: Abandoned

Noxy burst out laughing.  "Seriously?" she gasped.  "You expect me to
believe that---" And then she started laughing again.

Thokmay and Kulbinder waited patiently for her to get her hysteria
under control.  When she didn't, Thokmay shrugged and began dabbing
the blood on the tiger's flank again.  "I told you," he muttered.  The
tiger closed his eyes and flicked an ear, but said nothing.

Noxy finally wound down.  She felt lightheaded, as if she had woken up
too early from a mid-afternoon nap.  She wrapped her arms around
herself and shivered.  "Really?" she asked.  "You're really a prince?"

Thokmay nodded without looking up.  "Really.  Most noble families send
their children out into the world in disguise for a couple of years so
that they can see what life is like beyond the palace walls.  My
mother was a carpenter's apprentice when she was my age."

He rolled up the blood-soaked bandage and set it down beside him.
"Not on the cloud," Noxy said automatically.  "It spooks them."

"Sorry."  Thokmay stuffed it into the sleeve of his uniform jacket
as if it were a handkerchief.  "Anyway, my father's spymaster was
already suspicious of Princess Shudarga, and wanted to send one of his
agents to have a closer look, so..."  He shruggged again.  "Here we
are."

"So you're a spy as well as a prince?" Noxy asked disbelievingly.

The corner of Thokmay's mouth twitched.  "Not me.  *He's* the spy."
He patted Kulbinder's flank.

"At your service," the tiger rumbled without opening his eyes.  "Now
can we please get on with it?"

There was a needle and some cotton thread in with the bandages, and a
small knife with a very sharp blade.  The prince trimmed the hair
around Kulbinder's wound as short as he could, then put in three
stitches.  Noxy almost threw up the first time he pushed the needle
into the tiger's flesh, but other than twitching his tail, Kulbinder
showed no sign that he even felt it.

When it was over with, Thokmay splashed some water on his hands and
wiped as much blood as he could onto the bandge, careful not to let
any drip on the cloud.  "You look like you've done that before," Noxy
said.

"I guess."  Thokmay looked at the distant peaks.  "I wanted to learn
to be a doctress, not a soldier, but my father said that the men in
our family have always spent their foster years in the army."

"A doctress?"  Noxy blinked.  "Men can't be doctresses."

"Sure they can," Thokmay said defensively.  "Lots of men are
doctresses.  Well, maybe not *lots*, but..."  He shrugged yet again.
"Anyway, that's yesterday's breakfast now.  Once we're back in Gandan,
I'm going to---"

"We're not going to Gandan," Noxy interrupted, crossing her arms.
"We're going up into the mountains.  I'm going to find the grownups
and tell them what's happened and let them decide what to do next.
And don't tell me 'I have to' or anything like that," she added as the
prince opened his mouth.  "Not unless you've suddenly learned how to
mind-speak with clouds, because this one isn't going *anywhere* unless
I tell him to."

She kept her arms crossed through the shouting and somewhat weakened
roaring that followed.  She had to take them to Gandan because only
the royal army could rescue her fellow villagers.  She had to because
if the cloudherds tried to take on Princess Shudarga's troops they'd
be slaughtered.  Because the prince commanded her to.  Because the
*tiger* commanded her.

"I don't 'have to' anything!" she shouted back when her temper finally
snapped.  "If my mother or my granna were here, I'd do whatever they
told me.  Or maybe Grappa Gas---*maybe*---but that's about it.  Like I
said, unless you've magically learned how to cloudherd, we're going to
go and find some grownups.  Now how about both of you shut up for a
little while and let me steer this cloud?  Because all this shouting
is scaring him, and if he decides to drop you, I'm not going to even
*try* to stop him!"

It took her a moment to realize that Kulbinder's wheezing was actually
a chuckle.  "What!?" she demanded.

"You would have made a fine rhinoceros," he said.

"What's a rhinoceros?" she asked suspiciously.

They flew in silence after that, Thokmay next to Kulbinder and Noxy
cross-legged a few strides away.  She was so lost in her own thoughts
and fears that it wasn't until a stray snowflake snagged on her
eyebrow that she realized a storm was coming around the corner of the
pass up ahead.

She swore under her breath as she stood and flexed her foot, which had
gone to sleep, and shaded her eyes with her hand.  They were nimbus
clouds, she realized, her heart sinking.  Big ones, swollen with a
full winter's grazing on the snowfields of the high Brumosos.  If it
was just a few weeks later, her mother would have the villagers up on
their clouds to guide them south to bring much-needed rain to farmers'
fields in the Ninety Kingdoms.  She had no chance of doing that on her
own---no chance of doing anything except get out of their way or go
under them and hope she didn't spook them.

"Get the blanket," she said to Thokmay, belatedly adding, "Your
Highness.  Tuck it in around Kulbinder---it isn't much, but it's all
we have to keep him warm."

"How bad is it going to get?" Thokmay asked, reaching for the pack.

"Bad enough," Noxy replied grimly.

It wasn't bad---it was worse.  The bulls at the front of the herd were
still fighting for leadership.  Every butt and shove threw a flesh
flurry of snow into the air.  The cows and calves behind them picked
up on their agitation and shed snow of their own, until the air was a
soup of wet white flakes whipped every which way by gusts of wind.

The three travelers were soaked in minutes and shivering soon after.
"We'll freeze if we don't get out of this!" Thokmay said, shouting to
be heard.

"I know!"  Noxy shouted back.  "But I don't know how big this herd
is---it could stretch halfway to Chaghan!"

"Then let's turn around!"

She shook her head.  "We can't outrun them!" she said, not sure it was
true but not wanting there to be a reason to head toward Gandan.
"We'll have to set down!"

"But then we'll just freeze on the ground!" the prince protested.

"No we won't.  There's a place up ahead where we can get shelter."  *A
place I wanted to never visit again,* she added to herself grimly, but
it looked like they were out of choices.

Three Springs Canyon was a narrow cut between two brooding mountains
whose names Noxy had never learned.  In summer, the stream that ran
through it was full of diver bees, rock crabs, the stealthy squiddles
that hunted them both, and the occasional bear or troll with a taste
for fresh squiddle.  But summer hadn't come yet, so the dancing water
Noxy was familiar with was instead an angry torrent.  Fog from the hot
springs that gave the canyon its name drifted in the air like scraps
of wool, chilling the already-freezing travelers.

"How can you see in this?" Thokmay asked as a spur of rock suddenly
appeared out of the mist.

"I can't," Noxy said curtly.  "But *he* can."  She patted Big Blue.
"Now shush."  In truth, the cloud she was steering could barely see
further ahead than she could, and wasn't happy about it.

*Home,* Big Blue pleaded.

*Soon,* Noxy mind-spoke back, putting all the comfort and certainty
she didn't feel into her thoughts.  *Soon.*

The air cleared almost instantly once they were past the last hot
spring.  Behind them, the storm still raged in the canyon, but none of
the clouds had turned away from the herd to follow them.  Noxy pulled
her coat tighter around her, eyeing the shivering prince.  "How's he
doing?" she asked, jerking her chin at Kulbinder.

"He needs to be somewhere warm.  And dry."  Thokmay stroked the
tiger's flank.  Kulbinder's tail twitched, but he didn't open his
eyes.  "Wherever you're taking us, I hope we're there soon."

As Noxy opened her mouth to reply, a trickle of smoke stung her
nostrils.  She got to her feet.  "There," she said, pointing.  "We'll
be able to set down there."

'There' was a one-room hut perched on a not-quite-level shoulder of
the canyon.  Its walls were made of piled stones with moss and clay in
the chinks to keep the wind out, and its roof was slats overlain with
branches.  There were no windows, and a bamboo tube with a shingle cap
served as as chimney.  If not for the thin wisp of smoke rising into
the air, Noxy would have said it had been abandoned yeares ago.  Even
with that, part of her hoped that it had...

Big Blue descended gingerly into the cul de sac beneath the hut and
pressed himself against the mountain.  With Thokmay gently urging him
on, Kulbinder struggled to his feet and limped off the cloud and
picked his way uphill through the loose stones and patches of unmelted
snow.  Noxy followed them, the travel pack over her shoulder.

"Hello?" Thokmay called.  "Is anyone there?"  Silence.  "Is anyone
there?" he repeated more loudly.

Suddenly impatient, Noxy strode past him and knocked on the door.
"Hello the house!" she called out, not waiting for an answer before
lifting the little latch and pulling it open.

It was empty.  The dying embers of the morning's fire still glowed in
the little brick fireplace beneath the chimney, and a piece of
yellow-orange dayglass hadn't quite shed the last of the previous
day's sunlight.

Noxy wrinkled her nose at the heavy, unwashed smell of someone who had
done no more through the freezing winter than splash a bit of water on
his face and dab at his armpits.  "Come on in," she said, half glad
and half disappointed and trying to hide both.  She yanked some
blankets off the narrow cot on one side of the hut and made a quick
pile in front of the fireplace.  "Put him down there.  I'll get some
more wood."

Thokmay hesitated, clearly wanting to ask questions, then nodded and
began trying to make Kulbinder comfortable.  Noxy stepped around him
and went back outside.  As soon as she was around the corner, she
sagged against the wall and wiped her eyes.  She had no idea what she
would have said if the hut's resident had been there, but judging from
the fire, she was going to have to think of something soon.

Noxy gathered an armload of the driest wood she could find and carried
it back inside.  Thokmay watched in silence as she stacked it beside
the fireplace, then used her knife to shave some long splinters from
one piece and laid them on the embers.  When they began to smolder,
she added a few more shavings, and finally the whole piece of wood.
The warm smell of burning pine slowly filled the hut.

Thokmay stirred.  "Thank you," he said quietly.

"You're welcome... Your Highness."  Noxy tossed some scraps of bark on
the fire as she added the last phrase.

"I'm sorry for not telling you sooner," the prince said.  "But we
didn't know who we could trust."

"Did the soldiers know?" Noxy asked.  "I mean, the two we captured?"

Thokmay nodded.  "Kulbinder told them.  That's why they made a break
for it.  I should have gone with them."

"No," the tiger said without opening his eyes.  "Using them as a
distraction was our best chance of---"

"I'm tired of using people," Thokmay snapped.  "I'm tired of people
getting hurt because I'm royal and they're not."

The tiger's tail twitched.  "Those almost sound like rebel words, Your
Highness."

Thokmay clambered to his feet.  "I'll take first watch," he told Noxy,
striding to the door and banging it shut behind him.

Noxy sat in silence for a moment, not knowing what to say.  She could
smell the tiger's damp fur, she realized, and for some reason that
stirred her into action.  She took a blue jug from the shelf beside
the cot and shook it.  Water gurgled inside.  "Here," she told
Kulbinder, settling beside him.  "Let me give that a wash."

As she peeled back the makeshift bandage, the tiger said, "You've been
here before."

Noxy nodded.  "Not for a while, though.  Sorry!"  She winced as the
bandage pulled a few hairs away from the tiger's side.

"And the man who lives here?" the tiger asked.

Noxy paused.  "How do you know---oh.  You can smell him?"  The tiger
grunted.  Noxy carefully poured a few more drops of water onto the
bandage to loosen it.  "He's a magician.  He used to live in Stale
when I was little, but then a bunch of people got sick with the
scribbles, and he had to do a spell to save them, and now he can't
sleep in a house that's close to anyone else, so he lives here."  She
shrugged as if it didn't matter.  "Or in a cave down by Duck
Droppings, or sometimes in another hut that's further up the pass.  He
still does magic sometimes for us and the other villages, but my
*amma* says he's getting absent-minded.  Sorry."

The tiger made a sound deep in his throat as the bandage tugged at
some more hairs, but didn't move a muscle.  "Don't be.  You humans are
sorry for too many things, too often."  He yawned.  "Please don't let
the prince stay out there too long."  And then the only sound in the
the hut was his snoring, and the crackling of the fire, and the
whistle of the wind through chinks in the walls.

Noxy must have dozed, because she woke with a start when the door
banged open.  "Trolls," Thokmay said curtly.  "A dozen of them, and
those are just the ones I can see."

Kulbinder struggled to his feet.  "What are they doing?"

"Just watching, but every time I turn around, they've come a little
closer."  The prince knelt in front of the fire and chafed his hands.
Tiny beads of sweat glistened on his dark skin.  As Kulbinder turned
toward the door, Thokmay put out a hand to stop him.

"I need to see for myself, Your Highness," the tiger rumbled.

"You need to rest," the prince replied firmly.  "Noxious and I will
keep an eye on them."

*Thump!* Something heavy landed on the roof above them.  Thokmay drew
his sword with a quiet curse.

"So much for resting," the tiger said.

"I don't understand," Noxy said helplessly.  "We've had a truce with
the trolls for years."

*THUMP!*  Something much heavier came down on the roof.  A deep voice
grunted something that was clearly a command.

"That was no troll," Kulbinder snarled.  "That was an gorilla, or I'm
a rabbit."

"An ogre," Thokmay said before Noxy could ask.  "But what's an ogre
doing here?"  His eyes went wide.  "Working for the princess," he
breathed, answering his own question.

"We need to be elsewhere, *now*," Kulbinder hissed.

It took only a moment to thrust their meager belongings back into the
pack, and to scoop a few coals out of the fireplace into a pan and
douse the rest with water---even with trolls and ogres outside, Noxy
couldn't bring herself to let it go out completely.

She shouldered the pack and picked up a stick of firewood.  It wasn't
much of a club, but hefting it felt better than being empty-handed.
For a moment she wished Grappa Gas and his slingshot were there, or
that she was somewhere else.  Then she looked at the prince and the
tiger and nodded.  "Ready."

*One.*  She yanked open the door.  Thokmay heaved the bundle of blankets
through it.

*Two.*  The ogre dropped onto the blankets with a roar.

*Three.*  With a roar of his own, Kulbinder threw himself onto the
ogre's back and dragged his claws through its thick fur.

*Four.*  As the ogre bellowed and reached back to grab the tiger,
Thokmay and Noxy ran for the dropoff.

*Five.*  A shingle torn from the roof exploded against a rock an arm's
length from Noxy.  "Go!" Kulbinder roared behind them.

*Six.* A troll burst into view from behind a rock ahead of them, its
teeth bared.  "Gandan!" Thokmay shouted, swinging his sword.  The
troll dodged back and went down in a tangle with a second troll.

*Seven.* Noxy threw herself onto Big Blue.  Thokmay landed beside her,
stumbling and falling.  "Hurry!" Noxy shouted to Kulbinder, and,
*Wait!* she mind-shouted at Big Blue, who was already pulling away in
panic.

"Wait!  What are you doing!?" Thokmay demanded.

"I can't stop him!" Noxy shouted.  *Please, wait!* she begged, but the
big cloud ignored her.  She stared helplessly as Kulbinder skidded to
a halt at the edge of the dropoff.

"There!" she shouted, pointing down the narrow canyon toward the pass
to a spur of rock.  "Quickly!"

The tiger didn't need to be told twice.  He turned and ran with an
awkward three-legged gait.  Beyond him, the wounded ogre picked up a
rock and flung it with all its might.  *Crack!*  The rock shattered
against a boulder, flinging dagger-edged shards in all directions.

"Faster faster faster," the prince begged, his sword forgotten in his
hands.  The trolls were scrambling across the loose scree toward the
rock spur, clumsy on the ground compared to their grace in the trees
but still fast, so fast.

*He's not going to make it,* Noxy realized, her heart sinking.  She
dropped to one knee and put her hand on Big Blue's back.  *Go closer!*
she ordered.

The cloud sped up.  Noxy clenched her jaw.  *I said **closer**!*  The
whole cloud jerked to one side like a goof stung by a bee, toppling
Thokmay off his feet.

"Now!" Noxy screamed. "Jump now!"  And as another rock flew through
the air, Kulbinder skidded on the rocks, rolled over, sprinted toward
the cliff's edge, and threw himself into the air.

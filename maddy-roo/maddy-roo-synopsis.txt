Maddy Roo: Synopsis

"Maddy Roo" is set in a world populated by anthropomorphic animals and robots of all shapes and sizes.  Its titular protagonist, Maddy, is a 12-year-old kangaroo whose younger sister, Sindy, is a "throwback" with no fur, no scales, no tail.  Their father was kidnapped by a raiding band of robots two years before the story opens, and they and their mother have struggled to make ends meet since then.

While Maddy is out walking one evening with her best friend, a goat boy named Gumption, they rescue a damaged robot from a stream.  Its regulator has been broken, which allows it to reveal that another raid is about to take place.  Maddy and Gumption rush back to town to warn everyone.  In the fight that follows the raiders are driven off, but not before grabbing Maddy's sister and two other youngsters.

Maddy teams up with the rescued robot, Dockety, to get her back.  The pair manage to catch up with the raiders and free the prisoners; in the confusion that follows, Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety are stranded in a polluted swamp.  They take refuge in an abandoned bunker, only to discover that it is the lair of a mad robot named Patient in Darkness who is responsible for the raiding parties.  The trio escapes by bolting a flying suit onto Dockety and get back to town just moments ahead of a fresh wave of raiders.

In the aftermath of the battle that follows, Maddy realizes that she knows how to free the bots that Patient in Darkness has enslaved.  She uses the flying suit to return to the bunker and manages to break Patient's control just in time.  As the story ends, Dockety reveals that it knows where Maddy's missing father has been taken.

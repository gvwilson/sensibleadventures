## Prolog

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, its single
continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer
shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet speck of life as a
child might cup a drop of water in her hand.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as
well.  Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a century-long
Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of
glass, and littered the land with strange magic.  When it was over the
Pilots were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.*

*Now look there, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless
squabbles of the Ninety-Nine Kingdoms.  A girl is doing her chores.
No longer a child but not yet an adult, she has no idea that her world
is about to change forever...*

## Chapter 1: Soldiers

Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale.
Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a
clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked between the
twisted mountain pines.

"Shoo."  She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick.  It waved
its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away.  Noxy cut
the anchor threads of its with two practiced twists of her knife and
began winding it onto a stick.

"Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?" Sensy asked,
pulling a branch aside to see if another web lay beneath it.

Noxy glanced at her.  "Why? Are those ones coming loose?"

Sensy looked down at her soft brown goofskin coat critically.  "No.
They're just kind of plain."  She sighed wistfully.  "Granna Fee has
some really nice red ones.  She said she'd give them to me if I weeded
her pepper garden."

"Her whole garden?"  Noxy shook the dew off the spider's web and
stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder.
"That's a lot of work for some buttons you don't really need."

"Oh, you're no help," Sensy pouted.  She had spent the winter
embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar.
All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes and her
hair and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't
possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale.  Especially
Rash---practically *anyone* would be more fun to be around than Rash.

"A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes," Granna Fee
had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who
seemed to have taken her best friend's place.

"Not me!" Noxy had declared.

Granna Fee had laughed and ruffled her granddaughter's hair.  "No,
daffodil, not you."

Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted,
"Soldiers! Soldiers!"

"Oh, great," she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy.  The whole point
of going out to collect spiderwebs that morning had been to get *away*
from the younger children for a few hours.

Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked
himself up and ran to the two girls.  "There's soldiers in the
village!" he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve.  "And
they've been fighting!  And there's a *tiger* with them!"

"Sure," Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away.  "And there's a
dragon under your bed."  The pass below Stale were still blanketed in
snow.  Avalanches happened almost every day---someone would have to be
foolish *and* desperate to be on the road this early in the spring.

"But there *are*!" Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to
another with excitement.  "They've got swords, and some of them are
bleeding!  And the tiger can *talk*!"

Noxy opened her mouth to say, "Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?"
but a deep *doom doom* cut her off.  She and Sensy looked at each
other wide-eyed.  *Doom doom*, pause.  *Doom doom*, pause.  It was
Stale's home drum.  It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had
wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed
help to find their way home.  It meant trouble.

Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch.  "Come on!" she told Sensy,
setting off at a run.

"I told you!" Young Gas shouted behind them. "I told you there
was---hey, wait for me!"

Patches of ice made the path slippery underfoot, but Noxy didn't slow
down until she reached the ridge overlooking the village.  There, in a
clearing left by a long-ago lighting strike, she paused to catch her
breath.

The ancient walls of the fortress of Stale lay below her.  Rain and
snow had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look
like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as
solid as the mountains themselves.

The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the walls like
ducklings in a nest.  Thin wisps of smoke rose from their slate
chimneys, while vegetable plots and racks of drying spiderwebs filled
the spaces between them.

To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.  A
net woven from squirrel spiders' webs was stretched over its top, as
light as a dream but as strong as steel.  Another net hung down at the
gorge's mouth to make a gate.  Inside, just visible from the ridge,
two gray clouds drifted half-asleep.

Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds,
riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them.
Grownups called the pair slow and lazy, but they were the most
exciting things in Noxy's world---except, of course, for the herd of
half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance.

Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her hand.  "Wait!"
she hissed, pointing into the trees.  For a moment all Noxy saw was
branches.  Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and suddenly she could
make out a hairy form in the trees.

Noxy's mouth went dry.  She felt Sensy squeezed her hand, and squeezed
back.  As long as they didn't startle it...

Little Gas burst out of the bushes behind them and ran headlong into
Noxy.  "Oof!" he exclaimed, "What are you---mmph!"

"Sh!" Noxy whispered urgently, her hand clamped over his mouth.
"Don't... move..."

Before Young Gas could protest, the troll stepped into the clearing.
His fur was silvered with age, and his eyes seemed as old as the
mountains themselves.  He and Noxy stared at each other for one long
moment before he leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up
into the tree.  After one last look, he disappeared into the greenery.

Sensy was the first to speak.  "Wh-what's a troll doing *here*?" she
asked shakily, still holding Noxy's hand.

Noxy shook her head.  "Worry about that later.  Come on!"

The drum had stopped booming by the time the children reached the
fortress wall.  An enormous stone door stood half-open at the
entrance, its iron hinges melted in some long-ago battle.  The wooden
gate that Stale's current human inhabitants had built to fill the gap
was made of whole tree trunks, but still looked like a child's toy
next to the Pilots' ancient work.

Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the main
square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who
had left a week ago to collect Stale's clouds from their wintering
grounds in the high peaks.  Three hundred people were there, from
babies in their mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, all in an
uncertain muttering half-circle.

A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front of them.  Each one had a
battle mask painted with fierce swirls of red and black pushed up on
top of his head.  Leather armor, as thick as bootsoles and studded
with metal, protected their bodies, while heavy wool kilts reached
from their waists to their knees.  Some had swords in scabbards on
their hips, while others had bows or spears, but each had a heavy pack
on his back.

And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting.  One man's hand
was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling.
None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard
faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.

But Noxy didn't see any of that right away.  What she saw instead was
the tiger.  His stripes were dark brown on tan, not black on orange
like the picture in the story book that three generations of village
children had passed from hand to hand.  A pair of golden earrings hung
from his left ear, and his tail twitched now and again as if the
villagers' murmurs reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.

A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack
as large as any of theirs.  Four half-healed scars ran across his
cheek, glistening redly against his near-black skin.  His back was
straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was from cold,
weariness, or fear, Noxy couldn't tell.

Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve.  "Who *are* they?"

"Sh!" Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know.
"I'm trying to hear!"

Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and
stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the
square.  "Friends," she said in what Noxy thought of as her official
voice, "Friends, please.  I know it is early in the year for
travellers, but please greet Sergeant Dorbu and the Gifted Kulbinder."

The soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers.  The
tiger merely blinked.  "They and their companions will be our guests
for the next little while," Indy continued.  "I trust you will all
make them welcome."

"How long's a little while?" Grappa Gas asked loudly.  Noxy saw her
mother wince.  Everyone loved Grappa Gas---or nearly everyone---but as
Granna Fee said, sometimes the old man had the manners of a
constipated goof.

"Until they are ready to travel again," Indy reassured him.  Her eyes
swept across the crowd.  "Their journey has been a hard one---they
hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans.
Sergeant?  Would you like to say a few words?"

The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as
Indy stepped down.  Like his men, his skin was black compared to the
villagers' brown, and his head was fuzzy with wiry stubble.  The two
yellow ribbons around his sleeve were the only sign of his rank.

Before he could open his mouth, Grappa Gas asked, "So, are you lot
loyalists or rebels?"

"I'm sure he'll tell us if you give him a chance to speak!"  Heads
turned as a burly man, all shoulders and scowl, pushed to the front of
the crowd.

"Uh oh," Noxy said under her breath.  Grappa Gas's son Aft was the
best cloudherd in Stale, at least in his own estimation.  After one
too many arguments over how best to round up the village herd, Indy
had ordered him to stay behind and mend equipment instead of going
with the other adults.  Grappa Gas had happily taken the mayor's side,
and father and son had been squabbling non-stop ever since.

"Behave, both of you!" Indy said sharply.  She was a head shorter than
either of the men, but the iron in her voice left no room for
argument.  She nodded at the sergeant.  "Please, go ahead."

"Um, thank you, honored," the soldier said gratefully.  "And thank
you, people of Stale.  As your mayor said, my comrades and I were
trying to see if the pass to Chaghan was clear so that we could carry
news to Chaghan.  We---" He paused, and for a moment Noxy could see
how exhausted he was.  "There was an avalanche.  Three days ago.  It
drove those of us who survived off the road into the forest.
Everything seemed all right at first, but then the forest took offence
and..."  He shrugged.  "Well, you can probably guess what happened
next."

The villagers murmured.  The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso
Mountains from the rolling plain of Uws in the south to Garheim's
frigid shores in the north and the orchards and farms of Ninety-Nine
Kingdoms in the west.  It wasn't as cruel as the Jungle of Thind, but
it guarded its territory as jealously as a mother bear guarded her
cubs.  Gifted creatures that wanted to live in the forest did so on
sufferance, while humans were not welcome at all, not unless they
stuck to the handful of roads built long ago by the Pilots.
Travellers who strayed off them were rarely given warnings, and
*never* given second chances.

A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he
continued.  "We finally made it back to the road, but the worst of our
wounded couldn't go any further, so we left them in camp with a few of
the able-bodied and came here for help."  All traces of his earlier
smile were gone.  "That was the day before last.  I pray they're still
all right, but if they are, they won't be for much longer."

Grappa Gas broke the silence that followed.  "So which side *are* you
on?" he asked, his voice still loud but a notch less rude.

"I have the privilege of serving Respected Shudarga in this matter,"
Sergeant Dorbu answered calmly.

"Good for you!" Aft said firmly, his look daring anyone to disagree.

Grappa Gas snorted loudly.  "Good for some, maybe, but what about us?"
As with everything else, he and his son had chosen opposite sides when
Shudarga raised her flag.  "If King Denpa's men come looking for you,
these walls won't keep them out for long."

The sergeants shook his head.  "We didn't choose Stale for its walls,
honored.  We didn't really choose it at all.  We just washed up here
because we need help.  If you're afraid that'll bring trouble, we'll
understand if you send us on our way."

"Nobody is sending anyone away," Indy said firmly.  "We mountain folk
take pride in our hospitality.  I'm sure we can find some spare
blankets to keep you warm and stretch our stores enough to feed you
for as long as you need to stay."

"Thank you, honored," the sergeant said, bowing again.  "But what we
really want is a couple of clouds so that we can go and rescue our
friends."

*Shapers and Bots* is a role-playing game for children age 8 and older
inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
and every animal that ever walked upright and wore clothes
(including my daughter).
Each game has one or more **[players](#g:player)** and one **[Director](#g:director)**.
Each player takes on the role of one **[character](#g:character)**,
while the Director plays all the other characters,
who are called **[extras](#g:extra)**.
The Director can be an adult,
but children age 10 and older can also be Directors.

These rules focus on storytelling rather than realism.
Dice rolls are kept simple,
and there are no complicated tables showing how much damage a broadsword does compared to a katana.

## Background

Centuries ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals to create dozens of thinking species,
then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels:
half-human creatures with strange powers,
robots that are now their own masters,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you play a young animal adventurer or a newly-awoken bot
in search of adventure.
You can be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and can travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds.

## How to Play

Before the game begins,
the Director will either create an adventure or find one that someone else has created.
Each player can create a character,
or the Director can create characters for them.

Once the game starts,
each player determines what their character does.
When the player speaks,
the character speaks in the game world;
when the player says, "I'm going to kick down the door,"
their character tries to kick down the door.
There are no takebacks---you can't un-kick down a door---and
if the players spend two minutes arguing about what to do next,
that's what their characters are doing in the game world.

## Character Features

Every character has strengths and weaknesses
that determine what they're good at and what they aren't.
We describe this by giving every character a **[rating](#g:rating)**
for seven **[features](#g:feature)**:

-   **Size** (abbreviated SIZ): how large the character is.
    If the character is exceptionally short or exceptionally skinny,
    the Director may allow the character to list height and weight separately.

-   **Fitness** (FIT): how strong and coordinated she is.
    Characters with a high fitness are good athletes.

-   **Dexterity** (DEX): how good the character is with her hands.
    This determines how well she can pick locks,
    play musical instruments,
    or perform surgery.

-   **Intellect** (IQ): how good she is at book learning and abstract reasoning.
    A character with a low Intellect isn't stupid---she just isn't good at logic puzzles.

-   **Sight** (SGT), **Hearing** (HER), and **Smell** (SML):
    These measure exactly what their names say.
    (Note that smell includes the sense of taste.)

If an extra is important to the plot---for example,
if they are a player character's sidekick---the Director may give them ratings for two more features:

-   **Courage** (CRG): how brave the character is.

-   **Honesty** (HON): how likely the character is to tell the truth.

Player characters don't have ratings for these features
because being brave and telling the truth (or not) are part of the game.

So what is a rating?
It's simply a number:
0 if the character is average,
positive if they're higher than average,
and negative if they're lower.
A positive rating is sometimes called a **[bonus](#g:bonus)**,
and a negative one is sometimes called a **[penalty](#g:penalty)**.

> **Example:**
> Gertrude is big and healthy,
> but not good with her hands and somewhat near-sighted
> (which isn't surprising, considering that she's an elephant).
> Her ratings are:
> - Size: +3
> - Fitness: +1
> - Dexterity: -2
> - Intellect: 0
> - Sight: -2
> - Hearing: 0
> - Smell: 0

Every character also has a feature called **Strength** (abbreviated STR)
which is the sum of their Size and Fitness ratings.
Basically,
big characters tend to be stronger than small ones,
but characters who aren't fit aren't as strong as characters who are.

> **Example:**
> Gertrude's strength is +4.
> Her cousin Norwin, on the other hand,
> has a Size of +4 (he's bigger than Gertrude) but a Fitness of -2 (he never exercises),
> so his Strength is only +2.

## Challenges

A **[challenge](#g:challenge)** is something a character might want to do,
like climb a wall or pick a lock.
Every challenge has a rating as well:
difficult challenges have negative ratings (penalties),
while easy challenges have positive ones (bonuses).

If a character tries to do a challenge,
the player rolls three dice,
adds up their results,
and then adds their rating and the challenges's rating as well.
If the total is 10 or less,
they have failed;
on 11 or more,
they have succeeded.

> **Example:**
> Gertrude is trying to take apart the clockwork timer on a small bomb.
> The challenge's difficulty is -1, and her Dexterity is -2.
> She rolls 3 dice and gets 5, 4, and 2, for a total of 11;
> after subtracting 1 for the difficulty and 2 for her poor Dexterity,
> her total is only 8,
> so she has failed.

People often write "3d+X" or "3d-X" to mean
"three dice plus or minus X",
so the roll above would be written "3d-3".

> **Example:**
> Panicking slightly,
> Gertrude decides to try smashing the timer.
> The Director decides that the difficulty is 0
>(it's neither particularly tough or fairly fragile),
> and her Strength is +4,
> so Gertrude needs to get 11 or more or 3d+4.
> She rolls 3 dice and gets a total of 11 once again.
> After adding 4 for her Strength, her total is 15,
> and the delicate clockwork is now so much scrap metal.

If character's rating plus the challenge's difficulty is greater than 2
and the outcome isn't critical to the game,
the Director can decide that the characer gets an **[automatic success](#g:automatic-success)**.
For example,
suppose Gertrude wants to lift a crate of chocolates.
Gertrude's Strength is +4
and challenge's difficulty is -1 (the crate is larger than average, but not remarkably so)
for a total bonus of +3,
so the Director decides the player can skip the dice roll.
This rule helps keep the game moving.

## Flukes

Sometimes it may seem like a character has no chance at all of doing something,
but since *Shapers and Bots* is a story-telling game,
there is always hope.
If a player rolls 18 on three dice---that is, if they get three 6's---their character automatically succeeds.
If they roll 17---that is, two 6's and a 5---something good happens,
but probably not what they expected.
These are called **[fluke rolls](#g:fluke)**.

> **Example:**
> Zitter had never even *seen* a laser pistol before today,
> but as the deranged one-eyed crocodile pirate charges toward her,
> she picks up the one she just found and frantically starts pushing buttons.
> The Director decides that finding the right combination of buttons has a difficulty of -10.
> Zitter rolls a triple 6:
> somehow,
> her fumbling fingers found the right buttons
> and she put a neat hole through the surprised crocodile.
>
> A moment later,
> another crocodile pirate comes around the corner, sword in hand.
> Zitter rolls again and gets 6-5-6, for a score of 17.
> The Director rules that her lucky shot has gone wild
> and brought a branch crashing down between her and the angry pirate.

Fluke rolls work in reverse as well,
because it's always possible for something to go wrong.
If a player rolls a total of 4 (which is two 1's and a 2),
they automatically fail at whatever they were trying to do.
If they roll a total of 3 (which is three 1's),
then not only have they failed,
but something really bad has happened.

> **Example:**
> Another day, another angry crocodile pirate...
> Zitter still hasn't figured out how to use her laser pistol,
> but when she tries to take a shot,
> her player rolls a 3.
> "Self-destruct initiated", the Director says in a mechanical voice.
> "Ten... nine... eight..."

## Contests

A situation in which one character is trying to out-do another is called a **[contest](#g:contest)**.
In this case,
both players roll dice and add their ratings,
and whoever has the higher score wins.
If there is a tie,
the Director rules on whether the contest continues or whether something unusual happened.

> **Example:**
> Gertrude and Norwin are arm-wrestling.
> Gertrude rolls 8, giving her a total of 12 (since her Strength is +4).
> Norwin rolls 10, giving him the same total (since his Strength is only +2),
> so the Director decides that they are still locked in combat.
> When they re-roll, they both get 11's.
> After adding their Strengths,
> Gertrude's score is higher,
> so she wins.

## Species

Every living character belongs to a **[species](#g:species)**.
They all stand upright, speak, and have hands and fingers,
but they also have fur (or feathers) and their feet look like animals' feet.
Different species have different default values for the seven features,
which are shown below.

All animals are either vegetarian or omnivores;
those marked as "carnivorous" simply have a particularly strong liking for meat.
Eating intelligent animals is considered cannibalism.

### Bear

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| +3  | 0   | -2  | 0   | -2  | 0   | 0   |

Bears are deeply spiritual animals,
apt to halt in the middle of combat and ask,
"But truly, what is the point of such strife?"
Of course,
if you were this big,
you could afford to be philosophical too.

-   Fur counts as natural armor (but without any attack penalty).
-   Claws and bite count as small weapons.

### Bison

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| +3  | 0   | -4  | 0   | -2  | 0   | 0   |

Bison are rarely found on their own---in fact,
most suffer from acute isolophobia (a fear of being alone).
They are naturally protective of weak members of their "herd",
which can include their workmates, neighbors, and fellow adventurers.

-   Thick hide counts as natural armor (but without any attack penalty).
-   Horns count as small weapons.

### Crocodile

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | 0   | -2  | -1  | -2  | -2  | 0   |

Crocodiles are slow moving,
except when they're not,
and incredibly patient---particularly when it comes to their favorite sport: revenge.

-   Carnivorous.
-   Thick hide counts as natural armor.
-   Can hold their breath for 15 minutes.

### Crow

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -4  | +2  | -2  | +2  | 0   | 0   | -2  |

Crows are the fast-talking deal-makers of the animal world.
Their feathered appendages make them somewhat clumsy,
and they are fascinated by shiny objects.
Crows cannot fly by default, but are able to learn.

### Eagle

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -2  | +4  | -2  | 0   | +4  | +2  | -2  |

"As proud as an eagle" is a common saying, and is usually not meant as a compliment.
Natural aristocrats,
eagles are quick to take offense,
and their keen eyesight makes them natural guards and scouts.
Eagles cannot fly by default, but are able to learn.

-   Carnivorous.

### Elephant

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| +4  | 0   | 0   | +2  | 0   | +2  | 0   |

Elephants naturally form a matriarchal society:
females are in charge of government and business,
while most adult males skulk around the sidelines trying to find ways to be useful.
Young males often go on quests to try to win glory;
they are natural story-tellers and have exceptional memories.

-   Can use their trunk as a clumsy extra hand (though it's considered rude to do so in company).

### Fox

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -2  | 0   | +2  | +2  | 0   | 0   | +2  |

As cunning as crows,
foxes are nimble-fingered, quick-witted, and always looking for their next deal.

-   Carnivorous.

### Goat

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Goats are completely average in every way except for their horns.
(Telling them this is a good way to upset them.)

### Kangaroo

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | +2  | 0   | -1  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Kangaroos are the happy-go-lucky clowns of the animal world.
Townies often dye their tails in bright colors;
those who live in the wild will camouflage theirs instead.

### Lion

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Like elephants,
lions form matriarchal societies,
and their young males often go adventuring to try to win enough glory
to attract female attention.

-   Carnivorous.

### Monkey

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -2  | 0   | +4  | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Smart, curious, and mechanically minded,
monkeys are constantly tinkering with gadgets (or breaking them).
They are often less respectful of robots' personal space than they should be.

-   Can use their tails as a clumsy third hand.

### Parrot

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -4  | +4  | -2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

The only birds still capable of actually flying.

### Rabbit

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -3  | 0   | 0   | 0   | -2  | 0   | 0   |

It's easy to make fun of rabbits' small size and near-sightedness,
but nobody who has ever seen a fluffle of rabbits go bersek in battle is likely to do so.
Whenever a rabbit is wounded,
it loses control on a roll of 4, 5, or 6 on one die.
After that,
it gets an extra action each round which it *must* use for attacking
and gains +2 on all attack rolls,
but does not defend itself.

### Raccoon

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -3  | 0   | +4  | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Raccoons are the only competition monkeys have for the title
"most likely to get themselves into trouble".
They are very inquisitive,
but sometimes have trouble concentrating on---hey look,
a butterfly!

### Rhino

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| +3  | +2  | -4  | 0   | -2  | 0   | +2  |

They are not the largest animals,
but they are certainly the grumpiest.
Like bison (the only other animals they have much time for)
they prefer to stay with their herd,
and are fiercely protective of its weaker members.

-   They can charge their enemies (treat their horn like a small weapon).

### Sloth

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | 0   | -2  | +4  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Slow-moving but quick-witted,
sloths are sages and healers.
Some trim their long claws to improve their Dexterity,
but most accept their lot philosophically
and return to thinking about deeper things.

-   If a Sloth is a shaper, they start with a Low rating instead of Very Low.

### Tiger

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

As proud as eagles,
tigers are scornful of creatures that live in herds or packs,
including lions---*especially* lions.

-   Carnivorous.

### Turtle

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -2  | -2  | +2  | +2  | -4  | -2  | -2  |

Slow-moving and short-sighted,
turtles are natural shapers.

-   Shell counts as natural armor (with no attack penalty).
-   If a Turtle is a shaper, they start with a Low rating instead of Very Low.
-   Can hold their breath for 15 minutes.

### Wolf

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 0   | +2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | +2  |

Fast, strong, and brave,
wolves usually travel in packs of half a dozen,
and their alphas are often community leaders.

-   Carnivorous.

### Zebra

| SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| -1  | 0   | -2  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Zebras have a remarkable ability to hide themselves,
which is described below under "Skills".

## Customizing Characters

Animals of the same species can be quite different from one another.
When a player creates a character,
she can spend a total of 5 points raising the character's ratings.
She can do this by adding 2 points to two ratings and 1 point to a third,
or by adding 3 points to one rating and 1 each to two others,
and so on,
so long as she doesn't raise any rating by more than 4 points.
Players can go further and move up to 3 points from one rating to another.
For example,
a player could reduce the Fitness of a goat from 0 to -3,
then increase the goat's Dexterity to +3.

Increasing Sight or Hearing costs twice as much,
and lowering them is only worth half as much.
Increasing Smell costs three times as much,
and lowering it is only worth a third as much.
For example,
a player would have to reduce a character's Fitness by 2 points
to increase their Sight by 1,
or reduce their Sight by 2 in order to increase their Fitness by 1.
This rule is included for balance:
without it,
player characters all tend to have a very poor sense of Smell
and be near-sighted.

> **Example:**
> Garree is a 15-year-old goat.
> Her default rating is zero for everything,
> but her player decides to lower her Size by 1 point
> and distribute 6 points evenly across Fitness, Dexterity, and Intellect:
>
> | SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
> | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
> | -1  | +1  | +1  | +1  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

> **Example:**
> The same player makes different decisions for Garree's brother Gruff.
> His sense of Smell is reduced 3 points and his Intellect by 2 points,
> which gives him 8 points to distribute to other features.
> The player increases Gruff's Sight by 1 (which costs 2 points)
> and spends the rest on Size and Fitness:
>
> | SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
> | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
> | +3  | +3  | 0   | -2  | +1  | 0   | -3  |

## Choosing Skills

Every character has **[skills](#g:skill)**.
Some are automatic: for example, almost everyone can try to throw a rock.
Others are not:
nobody can play the oboe if they've never seen one before.
(Trust me on this.)

Just like features,
skills have ratings.
Positive ratings mean that characters are better than average.
negative ratings mean that they find even simple tasks difficult.

Some common skills are listed below,
along with a character's initial rating:

-   If the initial rating is "None",
    the character has no initial ability at all,
    and must rely on fluke rolls to accomplish tasks.
-   If a number is given,
    the character starts with that rating.
-   If a feature is given,
    the character's initial rating in the skill is equal to their rating for that feature.
    For example,
    every character's initial rating for Brawling is equal to their Fitness.
-   If a formula is given,
    their initial rating is whatever the formula calculates.
    For example,
    if a Fox has a Size of -2 and a Fitness of +1,
    their initial rating for Acrobatics is +3,
    which is Fitness *minus* Size.
    (Being small is an advantage when doing flips and walking a tightrope.)

| Skill           | Rating    | Explanation |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Acrobatics      | FIT - SIZ | jumping, walking a tightrope, doing a somersault, etc. |
| Animal Handling | INT       | calming a frightened horse or an angry wolverine |
| Boating         | -3        | managing a small boat or canoe |
| **Brawling**    | STR       | hand-to-hand combat without weapons |
| Camouflage      | -3        | disguising objects |
| Camping         | -3        | setting up a tent and making a fire |
| Charisma        | INT       | talking people into things, fooling them, and acting |
| **Climbing**    | FIT - SIZ | walls, ropes, and what-not |
| Computers       | None      | handling anything with a digital brain |
| Dancing         | FIT       | being graceful on the dance floor |
| Driving         | None      | wagons and motorized vehicles alike |
| Escapology      | DEX       | getting out of ropes or handcuffs |
| Farming         | -3        | growing food |
| First Aid       | -3        | handling broken bones and wounds; see Medicine |
| Gambling        | 0         | cards, dice, and bluffing |
| **Hiding**      | INT - SIZ | not being noticed when not moving |
| Hypnotism       | None      | putting people into a trance |
| Mechanics       | None      | making things, fixing broken ones, and picking locks |
| Medicine        | None      | handling disease and infection; see First Aid |
| Navigation      | None      | finding your way by the stars and other signs |
| Picking Pockets | DEX - 3   | taking things without being noticed |
| Riding          | FIT       | bicycles and horses |
| Sailing         | -5        | handling a large ship |
| Singing         | HER - 3   | making music with the voice |
| Skating         | FIT - 3   | handling yourself on metal runners |
| Skiing          | FIT - 3   | handling yourself on lengths of wood |
| Stage Magic     | None      | juggling, sleight of hand, etc |
| **Stealth**     | FIT - SIZ | moving without or being noticed |
| **Swimming**    | STR - 3   | keeping your head above water |
| **Throwing**    | FIT       | how far and how accurately |
| Trapping        | -5        | making traps that work |
| Tunnelling      | -3        | digging tunnels that don't collapse |
| Ventriloquism   | None      | throwing your voice |

It's usually worth figuring out a character's skill at the skills marked in **bold**,
since they come up so often in adventures.
Note that some skills like Climbing, Hiding, and Stealth get *better* if the character is *smaller*.
For example,
if a character's Fitness is +2 and their Size is +1,
their Stealth is +1,
but if their Size is -1,
their Stealth is +3.

> **Example:**
> Garree's features are:
>
> | SIZ | FIT | DEX | INT | SGT | HER | SML |
> | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
> | -1  | +1  | +1  | +1  | 0   | 0   | 0   |
>
> so her initial ratings for the commonly-used skills are:
>
> | Skill    | Rating |
> | -------- | -----: |
> | Brawling | +1     |
> | Climbing | +2     |
> | Hiding   | +2     |
> | Stealth  | +2     |
> | Swimming | -3     |
> | Throwing | +1     |

### Skill Categories

These four "skills" are actually categories.
Specialties within each must be mastered separately:

| Skill           | Rating    | Explanation |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Craft           | None      | sewing, woodwork, baking, metalwork, etc. |
| Fine Art        | None      | sculpture, drawing, painting, music, etc. |
| Lore            | None      | history, a language, mathematics, etc. |
| Weapon          | FIT - 5   | sword, spear, pistol, bow, etc. |

Finally,
someone's initial skill in Tracking is the best of their Sight, Hearing, or Smell.

### Choosing Skills

When a player is creating a character,
she can spend INT+10 points improving the character's skills.
For example,
if a character has an INT of +3,
they have 13 points to spend on raising skills.

-   Each raise costs 1 point, up to an increase by 3 levels.
-   Every raise after an increase by 3 levels costs 2 points.
-   Raising a skill from None to -5 costs 1 point.

> **Example:**

The Director may occasionally allow players to choose Skills that are not in the master list.
For example,
piloting a hot air balloon is different enough from Boating and Driving
that the Director may decide it's a skill in its own right.

### Leveling Up

After each adventure,
the Director may allow a player to raise a skill they used in that adventure by one level.
A player may also find a teacher to help them learn a new skill.
It is usually pretty easy to find someone who can teach the lower levels of common skills,
though lessons may come at a price.
Finding someone who can teach a character how to raise a skill beyond +5
can be a quest in its own right.

### Species Skills

-   **Crocodiles** and **Turtles** start with a Swimming skill of 0.
-   **Kangaroos**
    have a natural Jumping skill of 0,
    and automatically get +1 on Brawling
    (they're great natural boxers).
-   **Parrots** start with a Flying skill of 0.
    **Crows** and **Eagles** start with None,
    but can raise it using the usual rules.
-   **Parrots** also have a starting level of -3 in Ventriloquism.
-   **Sloths** have a "sixth sense" that warns them of danger.
    (It's hard to imagine how they'd survive without it.)
    Their initial rating is -3,
    and they can improve it with practice.
-   When **Zebras** are standing still,
    they can change color from black-and-white stripes to almost anything else
    in order to blend into their surroundings.
    This gives them an extra +2 Hiding at no cost.

## Combat

*Shapers and Bots* tries to keep combat simple.
Once a fight starts,
everything happens in turns that are 5 seconds long in game time.
In each turn,
characters act in order of Fitness,
with highest Fitness going first.
(If two or more characters are tied,
use a contest roll once at the start of the fight
to see who goes first for its duration.)

In their turn,
a character can take two actions.
Each of the following counts as a single action:

-   Attack someone.
-   Defend against an attack (see below).
-   Pick something up. (Dropping something doesn't count as an action.)
-   Draw a weapon.
-   Run from one place to another (see below).

Reloading a weapon counts as one or more actions depending on the type of weapon.
For example,
getting another arrow from a quiver counts as one action
(so archers can fire one shot per turn).
Reloading a crossbow,
on the other hand,
may require several turns.

Each attack is treated as a contest:

1.  The attacker declares who or what they are attacking.
2.  The target says whether they are going to use one of their actions for defense.
3.  If the defender *isn't* using an action for defense,
    the attacker succeeds if they roll their rating with the appropriate skill.
4.  If the defender *is* using an action for defense,
    the attack succeeds if the attacker makes their roll
    *and* the defender misses a roll.
    This is different from a regular contest roll.
    the attacker doesn't have to beat the defender's roll---the
    attacker has to succeed and the defender has to fail.

There are a few special cases:

1.  If an attack is a complete surprise,
    the defender doesn't get a defense roll.
2.  If the target hasn't had their turn yet,
    their defense uses up an action for that turn
    (i.e., if they defend themselves against an attack,
    they can only use one other action when their turn comes around).
3.  If the target has already used all of their actions,
    they can borrow an action from their next turn to use for defense.
    In practice,
    this often means that the character with the higher Fitness gets two attacks in the first turn,
    then one attack each turn after that
    (since they're borrowing actions from future turns for defense).
4.  If someone is attacked three or more times in a turn,
    then the only defense against the third and subsequent attacks
    is a fluke roll.

## Health and Injury

Every character starts the adventure with a number of **[health points](#g:health-point)** (HP)
equal to 3 + their Strength.
(If a character's Strength is -3 or less, they still get 1 HP.)
Every time a character is injured,
their character must win a challenge roll with their HP *before* the injury as a bonus
and the amount of the damage as a penalty.
If they fail the roll,
they have been knocked out.
Regardless of the roll's outcome,
they always lose that many HP.

A character is killed when:

-   Their HP goes negative.
-   They fail an injury challenge roll by 4 points or more.

> **Example:**
> Alouenne is a kangaroo with a Strength of +2,
> so she has 5 HP.
> As the tunnel collapses around her,
> she is hit by a falling rock that does 1 point of damage.
> She needs to win a roll with a +4 bonus (+5-1) to stay conscious.
> She rolls 9 on 3d, winning easily,
> but is now down to 4 HP.
>
> A second, larger piece of the ceiling now drops on her head and does 2 points of damage.
> She needs to win a roll with a +2 bonus;
> rolling 8, she fails and is knocked unconscious.
> She is also now down to 2 HP.
>
> The rocks keep falling.
> The next one to hit her does another 2 points of damage.
> She needs to win a roll without any bonus at all to stay alive.
> She rolls 12,
> but is down to 0 HP.
> One more big rock, and Alouenne will be out of the game...
>
> Pietro rushes in to save Alouenne.
> He is already down to 3 HP after a previous fight,
> and a particularly big rock lands on him before he can reach her.
> It does 3 points of damage,
> so he needs to win a challenge roll without any bonus.
> He rolls 5,
> missing the required 11 by 6 points.
> Pietro is a goner.

## Weapons and Armor

Weapons injure their targets---that's their whole purpose.
Weapons are classified as:

-   *Punch*, including kicking and other hand-to-hand (or hoof-to-knee) attacks.
-   *Small*, like a knife or a bull's horns.
    If someone has a score of +3 or higher in Brawling or has a Size of +3 or greater,
    their punches and kicks count as small weapons.
-   *Medium*, like a one-handed sword or ax.
-   *Large*, like a two-handed sword or a very large spiked club.

How much damage each kind of weapon does depends on whether or not the defender is wearing armor:

| Weapon | Unarmored          | Armored             |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Punch  | beat 12 for 1 point| beat 15 for 1 point |
| Small  | 1 point            | beat 12 for 1 point |
| Medium | 2 points           | 1 point             |
| Large  | 3 points           | 2 points            |

The phrase "beat 12 for 1 point" means "roll 12 or better on 3 dice to do 1 point of damage",
while "beat 15 for 1 point" means "roll 15 or better on 3 dice to do 1 point of damage".
Hurting an unarmored opponent with a punch,
or an armored one with a small weapon,
is therefore like winning a fluke roll,
only easier.
Note that armor counts against other kinds of damage as well:
for example,
the big rocks that fell on Alouenne and Pietro were considered medium and large weapons.
If either of them had been wearing armor,
they might have made it...

> **Example:**
> Doi has a hunting bow (which is a small weapon) and a broadsword (which is a medium weapon).
> She fires an arrow at Creszki and hits.
> The arrow does an automatic 1 point of damage,
> and Creszki has to roll to see if he loses consciousness.
>
> Doi drops her bow and draws her sword as Creszki charges at her.
> Her first swing connects, doing 2 points of damage.
> Creszki fails his roll and goes down, but his ally Priti is right behind him.
> Doi swings again and connects.
> Since Priti is wearing armor,
> Doi only does 1 point of damage.
> Priti makes his roll easily,
> so he shrugs it off and swings his large two-handed ax.
> He hits, doing 3 points of damage.
> Doi fails her roll and is unconscious.

## Healing

Someone who is knocked unconscious can try to regain consciousness
once per minute by winning a challenge roll with their Strength as a bonus (or penalty).
It's up to the Director to decide if they have to keep making injury rolls because of their wounds.

> **Example:**
> While Priti is going through Doi's belongings to see if she has anything worth stealing,
> her player rolls three dice and gets 13.
> After taking off 1 point (her Strength is -1),
> she still has 12,
> which is enough for her to regain consciousness.
> Quietly, she picks up her bow and gets off one more shot.
> Priti goes down---but the Director has ruled that Doi's wounds are still bleeding,
> so she needs to make another challenge roll to stay conscious.
> She fails and passes out once again,
> losing 1 HP as she does so.
> Things aren't looking good for our little fox...

## Shaping

A small number of animal characters have psychic powers
that let them control or **[shape](#g:shaping)** the world with their mind.
Characters who can shape typically start with a rating of Very Low,
which improves with practice and training.
The six known kinds of shaping are:

-  **Earth**: dirt and stone. Very experienced earth shapers can also shape metal.
-  **Air**: wind and sound.
-  **Light**: create (silent) illusions and wrap themselves in shadows.
-  **Water**: in its liquid form. Very experienced shapers can also shape ice.
   Using water shaping to control a living creature is extremely difficult
   and also a very serious crime.
-  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.
-  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.
   (Nobody can stop or reverse time, or see the future.)

It is *extremely* rare for someone to be able to do more than one kind of shaping.

> **Example:**
> Larrapin is an air shaper.
> Before her grandfather passed away,
> he taught her what little he knew,
> so her score is now -5 instead of none.

The Director must decide case by case how hard it is to shape something.
As a guide:

| Shaping | Easy Task (+3 bonus)             | Hard Task (-3 penalty)                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Earth   | Slide a pebble across a table    | Open a hand-sized hole in a brick wall |
| Air     | Puff of air to blow out a candle | Gust of wind to knock someone over     |
| Light   | Dim light to read by             | Illusion of a tree                     |
| Water   | Slosh water around in a cup      | Wave capable of swamping a canoe       |
| Luck    | Increase next roll by 1 point    | Lower enemy's roll by 3 points         |
| Time    | Take initiative in combat round  | Four actions in one combat round       |

These bonuses and penalties assume that the shaper is concentrating hard and doing nothing else.

## Bots

The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning floors to mining the ocean floor.
Since they disappeared,
the bots have repaired themselves however they can to keep themselves going,
and made new bots whenever they can find the right parts.
The result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike.
One might have six short legs and a pair of mis-matched claws for arms,
while another might use two rotor fans to fly,
but have only a single slender manipulator to pick things up.

Bots have Average ratings for Size, Dexterity, Intellect, Sight, and Hearing.
Only a few bots have any sense of Smell
(most regard smell as slightly icky,
and would prefer that living creatures didn't talk about it so much).
Bots also have Average Fitness,
which in their case means structural integrity:
a bot with Low Fitness is probably rusty or missing parts,
while one with Very High Fitness looks brand new
(and will therefore be a target for other bots in need of parts).
Bots can raise and lower one feature by one level,
or two features by one level each if one feature is lowered by a level,
just like animal characters.
(As with animals,
Sight and Hearing have to be lowered *two* levels to raise some other feature by one level.)

By default,
every robot character has either tracks, wheels, or legs to move with,
two arms (which don't have to match),
cameras,
a microphone (for hearing),
and a speaker (for communicating).
The player can then give it two more features from the list below,
*or* three more features as long as it takes a penalty from the second list.

#### Robot Features

-   Accelerator: can move very quickly for brief periods.
-   Arm: each extra arm counts as one feature.

-   Cart: some kind of large bin to carry things in.
-   Coldproof: able to function in extreme cold.
-   Cutting laser: counts as a small weapon, and drains power quickly.
-   Display screen: useful for displaying maps and other pictures as well as communicating.
-   Drill: can be small or large.
-   Electromagnet: for picking things up (such as armored opponents).
-   Extensible arm: good for reaching into difficult places.
-   Fireproof: able to withstand flames.

-   Microphone: super-sensitive hearing.
-   Power leech: can drain energy from other bots.
-   Powered flight: helicopter rotors, fan blades, or retractible wings and a propellor.  All drain power very quickly.
-   Radio: for silent communication with other bots that have radios.  Does not work underground or under water.
-   Sawblade: counts as a small weapon.
-   Searchlight: useful at night, underground, and for blinding opponents.
-   Solar panels: fold-out panels for recharging.
-   Submersible: not just watertight, but capable of "swimming".
-   Speakers: in addition to the default ones.
-   Tracks: heavy-duty tank treads (in addition to whatever is chosen by default).
-   Vacuum: for sucking things up---usually extensible.
-   Wheels: in addition to the default means of getting around.
-   Windmill: a retractible wind turbine for generating power.

#### Robot Penalties

-   Armless: no way to pick things up and manipulate them.
-   Blind: no cameras.
-   Buggy: will freeze or behave inappropriately under stress (e.g., in combat).
-   Cannot communicate: no screen or speakers.
-   Conspicuous: very noticeable (e.g., squeaky, or brightly painted).
-   Deaf: no microphone.
-   Fragile: flammable, parts easy to break off, etc.
-   Immobile: no way to move around on its own.
-   Not waterproof: and therefore susceptible to shorting out.
-   Obedient: programmed to follow orders from anyone or anything with a keyword or controller.
-   Slow: cannot move quickly.
-   Top-heavy: unable to right itself once turned over.
-   Weak battery: needs frequent recharging.

## Example Characters

### Syvia

Syvia is a teenage fox.
She has worked on her parents' fishing boat since she was a child,
so her player raises her Boating from Very Low to Average (2 points)
and her Swimming from Low to Average (1 point).
Since there are pirates in these waters,
her player also raises her skill with a *bo* (a long staff that counts as a small weapon)
from Low to High (2 points),
and her skill at Mechanics from High (her Dexterity) to Very High,
which uses up her final point.

| Feature     | Rating  | \| Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Size      | Low     | \| Boating      | Average   |
| Fitness   | Average | \| Swimming     | +2  |
| Dexterity | +2 | \| Quarterstaff | +2  |
| Intellect | +2 | \| Mechanics    | Very High |
| Sight     | Average | \|              |           |
| Hearing   | Average | \|              |           |
| Smell     | +2 | \|              |           |
| HP        | 5       | \|              |           |

### Rhymes With Orange

Rhymes With Orange was built to clean windows on ultra-tall skyscrapers.
It has long spidery limbs with suction cups for climbing,
but a very small body.
It also has a 5-liter storage tank built into its back,
and has modified the water jets on its arms to squirt almost any kind of liquid.
Rhymes With Orange's battery was damaged years ago
in an accident that also robbed it of most of its memories.
It can only go 3-4 days without being recharged by another bot,
so it is constantly doing odd jobs in exchange for power
or gambling to try to win a recharge.
(It only cheats when it has to.)

| Feature     | Rating  | \| Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Height    | +2 | \| Climbing     | Very High |
| Weight    | Low     | \| Acrobatics   | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | \| Gambling     | Very High |
| Dexterity | Average | \| Squirting    | +2  |
| IQ        | Average | \| Mathematics  | +2  |
| Sight     | Average | \| Navigation   | +2  |
| Hearing   | Low     | \|              |           |
| Smell     | None    | \|              |           |
| HP        | 6       | \|              |           |

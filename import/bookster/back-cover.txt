When the Pilots ruled the world, the flying mountain the world. After they destroyed themselves, it was taken over by wild-eyed tinkers fascinated by the Pilots' strange machines. They called themselves the Hett, and as the years passed, the people who lived below them regarded them with growing suspicion. Eventually, an ambitious young prince with few prospects at home decided to do more than mutter. The next time the flying mountain landed, the rag-tag army he had recruited attacked. Most of the Hett were slain outright. The rest were driven off the mountain with nothing but the clothes on their backs.

The Hett's storied wealth turned out to consist of scrap metal and books no one knew how to read. Undeterred, the prince retitled himself Captain and gave the Hett's houses and farms to his followers. Most of them smoked, drank, or gambled away their gifts, but the rest settled down to trade, raise families, and watch the world slip past beneath them.

Now look closer. There, in Starboard Town. Five hundred years have passed. A girl is running for her life. She just felt the mountain shake for the first time in centuries, but that's not what she's afraid of. She's afraid of what the boy chasing her will do to her if he gets his hands on her.

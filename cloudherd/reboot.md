# The Prince and the Cloudherd

NEEDED

*   whistle language among cloudherds

*   lots more animals in the village (chickens, etc.) but none Gifted
    *   casual prejudice against Gifted (Rash says something)
*   "People follow Shudarga because they love her. They obey Bonzon because they're afraid not to."
*   "As dead as a dog".
*   Grappa Gas's wooden leg sprouts new buds in the spring
*   the pen net doesn't go to the ground - it's mostly there to stop the clouds drifting out while they're asleep
*   Dorbu is shocked by the revelation that Bonzon is there to take control of clouds

        *   His soldiers don't have battle wounds, but are clearly the worse for wear
    *   Grappa Gas (royalist) interrupts to ask how soon they'll be going
    *   Aft counter-interrupts (make it clear he's on the rebel side)
    *   Indy squashes them both (make her control of the village obvious)
        *   "In the *tralpa*'s absence..."

        *   First up-close description of Thokmay and his scars
        *   And of Kulbinder's watchful menace
    *   Noxy marshals arguments, is surprised when her mother agrees so quickly
        *   Serves as character development: Noxy is used to being in charge of things
    *   Gather at the cloudherding pen (teens have strict orders to help, not get involved)
    *   See how cloudherding works
        *   in particular
            *   Aft has to wait until the first cloud is under him to jump

        *   Noxy's excited, then disappointed when it's only a troll
        *   Tells Gas and Fee about seeing a troll earlier that morning (keep it in the reader's mind)
    *   Arrival at the soldiers' makeshift camp
        *   There are more of them than Dorbu had led the villagers to believe
    *   Rescue
        *   Growing urgency as the clouds load up one by one
            *   Aft gives orders, Noxy repeats them, Rash says, "I heard" (again, growing resentment of Noxy's bossiness)
        *   Hard to tell what the forest will allow and what it won't
        *   But animals gathering
        *   One soldier takes a brand from the fire to scare them off

        *   Description of Bonzon
        *   Bonzon: "We'll return in the spring to lay the ghosts of those we couldn't."
            *   the way he said it made it a simple statement of fact, like "Water flows downhill" or "The sun rises in the morning."
        *   one of the "soldiers" makes a wisecrack
            *   Grappa Gas and Granna Fee: "You!"

## Chapter 3. Tension at Home

*   goals
    *   Bonzon vs. Dorbu
        *   Bonzon wants to order the Stalers around (but is initially too weak to do so)
        *   Dorbu wants to persuade them and work around their needs
    *   Noxy losing control
        *   Noxy is used to being the boss (and is afraid of losing her friends as they grow closer)
        *   Sensy and Rash are beginning to rebel (in part because they are now more interested in each other)
        *   Noxy's growing power feels like loss of control
        *   Realizes with a shock that she's mind-speaking to clouds without touching them
        *   Then tries to convince herself that she's mistaken, because if she's right...
    *   villagers amongst themselves (e.g. Indy vs. Grappa Gas and Granna Fee)
        *   Fee: "They can't stay, daffodil.  They can't."
        *   Fee's argument (we can't take sides) is different from Gas's (they're the wrong side)
        *   Indy: "We can't kick them out - we'd be killing them." and "And we *can't* kick them out.  They're soldiers, we're not."
        *   So this is also Indy vs. the burden of responsibility
    *   Grappa Gas vs. Aft
        *   they have always squabbled
            *   Aft's mother used to mediate
            *   She died of the scribbles (foreshadow Noxy's revelation about her dad)
            *   Dorbu: "Seem to be a lot of broken families here."
            *   Indy (sharply): "We don't think of ourselves as broken." (pause) "But cloudherding is a hard life."
            *   Dorbu (conciliatory): "I can only guess.  They do seem to fight a lot, though."
            *   Indy (smiling to take out the sting): "This from a man who's fighting a civil war?"
        *   Grappa Gas likes things the way they are - would rather fix the fishpond than save the world
        *   Aft wants things to change
            *   Would have gone off to explore the world if his mother hadn't been sick
            *   Never quite got around to it
            *   Shows unexpected vulnerability when talking to the soldiers about the world they've seen
    *   keep the trolls in the picture
    *   more hints about Noxy's powers
    *   Thokmay hiding his face from Bonzon
*   details
    *   Grappa Gas and Granna Fee realizes that the "soldier" who made the wisecrack is actually Tasteless
        *   Grappa Gas starts to set the cloud down to kick him off
        *   Dorbu stops him: "We have wounded"
        *   Granna Fee (grimly): "There'll be another wounded when Aft finds out he's here"
    *   Bonzon cuts in, giving crisp orders to Dorbu
        *   Bonzon wants patrols out right away, Dorbu wants to give the soldiers a rest
        *   Rash makes a crack about knowing how it feels to be ordered around
        *   Bonzon glances at cloudherds, clearly deciding *not* to say some things
    *   Arrive in Stale
        *   Soldiers offload the dead
        *   Noxy soothes the cloud
        *   after she gets off, she thinks, "Really sorry you had to carry them."
        *   thinks she hears the cloud reply, "It's all right."
        *   so shocked that she stumbles, but then convinces herself she was imagining it
    *   back to the main square where Indy is re-organizing the villagers
        *   has put on her blue-and-white jacket (her favorite colors, sky and snow)
        *   was halfway through getting things set up when the first cloud arrived with news of how many soldiers
        *   she's getting an update from Aft when Gas, Fee, and the others arrive with Tasteless in tow
        *   Aft picks up a piece of kindling and makes for Tasteless
        *   Indy intervenes, but is just as unhappy
        *   Tasteless affects to be amused
        *   Dorbu (puzzled): "Meant no offense, but-"
        *   Indy (curtly): "He's been shunned."
        *   Bonzon (resists being taken to lie down): "We needed a guide"
        *   Resolution: he can sleep in one of the winter huts
        *   Aft: "We'll have to smoke it clean after"
    *   Thokmay reports to Dorbu wearing his battle mask (Bonzon is nearby)
        *   Dorbu: "Why are you masked?"
        *   Thokmay (woodenly, half-muffled by the mask): "I was moving too slowly on the stairs, honored."
        *   Dorbu: "I'm going to have a word with that tiger about how hard he pushes you."
        *   Thokmay: "I would be grateful if you did not, honored."
        *   Dorbu (shaking head as Thokmay leaves): "Pushes himself too hard, that one.  And Kulbinder pushes him even harder sometimes."
        *   Bonzon (frowning): "An orphan?"
        *   Dorbu: "Yes, honored.  Came to us just a few months before the rebellion."
        *   Bonzon tells Dorbu they need to have a discussion away from prying ears
        *   Figure out later Thokmay is hiding his face from Bonzon
    *   Conversations at home
        *   Indy has Noxy make tea
        *   Gas shows up first: "We're being overrun! We have to do something!"
            *   Cites Tasteless as example - "How can we trust people who trust the likes of him?"
            *   Takes out his knitting, then takes something eye-watering out of his pocket and puts it in his tea (lighten up the story)
            *   Noxy makes an excuse and escapes upstairs for a moment to get away from the smell
            *   Brief description of her room - she opens her skylight a bit to let the smell out
        *   Fee shows up next: "They can't stay, daffodil."
            *   Mention Duck Droppings: "What will the other villages think?"
            *   Continues: "And when they hear we've got a backstabbing sack of turds like *him*..."
        *   Filler
            *   Cloudherds have argued about supporting the rebellion (or the king) before
            *   Decision was to stay out of lowland wars
        *   Everyone's calming down when there's a crash and a yowl outside
            *   Noxy is the first one out the door
            *   Thokmay is chasing a troll
            *   Noxy recognizes the one that she saw that morning
            *   It gets away
        *   Conversation
            *   Thokmay: "Troll was listening to you"
                *   Reveal that trolls are chimpanzees
                *   Noxy thinks "You must have been listening too"
            *   Grappa Gas: "What's a troll doing this close to the village?"
            *   Indy: "On their own or at the forest's orders?"
            *   Reveal that the village has a deal with the trolls
            *   Kulbinder arrives - chased the troll but lost him
            *   Indy: "Perhaps tomorrow my daughter can show you two around"

        *   Noxy wonders if he wears it to hide his scars
        *   Introduces herself
        *   She asks if he enjoyed his breakfast (awkward attempt to make conversation)
        *   Thokmay: "Yes." (glance at Dorbu, then repeats) "I particularly liked the peppers."
    *   Noxy, Thokmay, and Kulbinder set out

        *   Thokmay goes over to pet them
        *   both immediately round on him

        *   Thokmay: "What did he do?"
            *   Noxy: "Took a bribe to flood some fields in Tongsa - some people died"
            *   Thokmay: "Why isn't he in prison?"
            *   Noxy: "Told everyone it was an accident, then spent his bribe to rent a law to get off"
            *   stops as she realizes what she's saying
    *   awkward change of subject - Noxy describes the clouds
        *   Thokmay: "They smell like wet goofs."

            *   Noxy thinks, "That never happens!"
        *   Sensy (changing subject): "Anyway, Grappa Gas is taking him up for a ride"

            *   Realizes she's been hearing Grappa Gas blow "emergency" on his horn
            *   but there isn't a pattern for "fallen in the water and freezing"
            *   races down the stairs to the main square
            *   Yells, "He's fallen in the pond!" at her mother and Granna Fee in passing
            *   grabs the bag of bad news from the traders' hall
        *   Colonel Bonzon is there
            *   demands to know what's happening
            *   she says, "He's fallen in the water!"
            *   he grabs her arm as she turns to go: "What's happening?
            *   "Let go of me!"
            *   Bonzon's face sets: "Not until you tell me..."
            *   face drawn and feverish
            *   "Thokmay's fallen in the pond and Kulbider's gone in after him and they're going to freeze now let me *go*!"
            *   Dorbu intervenes: "Honored!  Honored, please!"
            *   pries fingers off (gently)
            *   Bonzon nods
        *   Noxy runs down to the pond
            *   everyone's just getting out, frozen
            *   Noxy offers the magic blanket to Thokmay
            *   he demurs, she insists: "It's magic, stupid!"
            *   the two huddle together under it
            *   Grappa Gas circling over head, shouts, "Are they all right?"
            *   Noxy: "I think so!"
            *   Grappa Gas nods and turns the cloud back toward the pen
            *   Tasteless (shouting up): "You're welcome!"
        *   everyone starts walking back to the village
            *   Indy, Aft, and Granna Fee meet them part-way
            *   as soon as Aft hears that Thokmay fell in, he loses his temper at Gas
                *   Tasteless makes a crack
                *   Aft blocks Tasteless from entering the village
            *   Thokmay and Kulbinder go to the sauna
                *   Kulbinder: "It will feel like home"
        *   Grappa Gas joins them (limps up the path with a one-two stride)
            *   Aft lets him have it verbally
            *   Aft: "What are you going to do, kill them one at a time!?"
            *   Gas (aghast): "I didn't do that!"
            *   Aft: "You've been herding longer than I've been alive!"
            *   Indy and Fee separate them
            *   Indy (sternly): "We'll talk about this over a cup of tea."
            *   Gas (protesting): "But---"
            *   Indy: "Tea!  Now!"  (Makes it sound like a prison sentence.)
        *   Back to Indy's house
            *   Aft and Grappa Gas go in, Indy "asks" Fee to look after Noxy
            *   They can hear the raised voices even before the door is properly closed
        *   Walk to Granna Fee's house in near silence (just around the corner)
            *   have their own friendlier cup of tea
            *   the whole way, all Noxy can think is, "I did that"
        *   Fee: "Good thing we had the magic blanket."
            *   Noxy shivers: "I could use a magic blanket myself."
            *   Fee: "Your father said he could only make one."
            *   Noxy: "What did he trade?"
            *   Fee (shaking head): "He didn't say.  It's not the sort of thing you ask a magician."
        *   she tells the story of how Ulfmaerr discovered he had magic
            *   bargained with a passing whale by accident
            *   Noxy (hesitantly): "Do you think I might be a magician some day?"
            *   Granna Fee (starts to smile, then realizes Noxy is serious): "Maybe.  But nobody and nothing can *make* you a magician.  You have to choose."
        *   segue into discussion of Tasteless
            *   Granna Fee (coldly): "He made his choice too"

	*   Dorbu: "There's a big difference between being hungry and starving" (and he's glad he's neither right then)
        *   Indy: "Is it worth killing for?"
        *   Dorbu (steadily): "I believe it's worth my life.  And if it's worth mine, it's worth others."
        *   Kulbinder: "I'm a cat" as if that was all that needed to be said

    *   Noxy sees someone
        *   for a moment she thinks it's a troll because of its size
        *   then a flash of light from a shielded lantern reveals it's Thokmay
        *   but what is he doing out?
    *   the kettle in her hand bumps against the wall with a clang

        *   Dorbu (soothing, before Bonzon can speak): "Unlikely."
        *   Bonzon (glowering): "But not impossible.  The Fifth was just a few days behind us."
        *   Bonzon: "And even if we *had* taken down that bird, they'll come looking for their rangers."
        *   Grappa Gas: "Are you going to fight here?"
        *   Bonzon (impassive): "Only if they come after us, and only if you let them get here - a couple of clouds would stop them."
        *   shocked silence
        *   Indy (and others): "No!"

        *   Bonzon (looking at the clasp on the second one): "They'll be through that in a heartbeat"
        *   Aft (eager to please): "We can nail it shut"

        *   Noxy (panting): "Why not just let him go?"
        *   Corporal Choegyal: "Because he's seen everything"
        *   Thokmay really doesn't want Noxy to come

        *   Triggers memory of being younger and hiding in the back of an empty tunnel in the wall (without goofs)
        *   Sharp smell of onions... earthy smell of potatoes and turnips
        *   Being inside... all that rock above her... she couldn't breathe
    *   Kulbinder joins them
        *   Kulbinder (to Thokmay): "You shouldn't have come. And you shouldn't have brought *her*."
        *   Thokmay: "He could be anywhere."
        *   Noxy: "But if you can tell where they fought..."
        *   Thokmay (firmly): "Anywhere."
        *   Noxy's head twinges again: she can see where he is through a dozen pairs of eyes

    *   Kulbinder asks her what happened
        *   she says she doesn't know

    *   return to Stale
        *   Corporal Choegyal is at the gate setting up patrols
            *   Indy is arguing with him (Grappa Gas is shouting)

            *   hustles Noxy away
            *   takes Gas with her (so that he won't get into a fight)
            *   Indy goes back to arguing fruitlessly with Choegyal
    *   walking back to Fee's house
        *   soldiers are putting a bar on the door of the traders' hall and nailing the windows closed
            *   aside: "Wouldn't occur to Noxy then to wonder why the bar and nails were on the outside..."
        *   Fee can't talk about Noxy's powers in front of Gas
            *   instead, looks worried and asks leading questions
        *   as they pass the goof pens, Granna Fee says, "There's something you need to know..."
            *   Grappa Gas gives her a warning look
            *   Granna Fee snaps, "She's old enough..."
    *   a few minutes later, Noxy climbs the stairs
        *   sees Rash and Sensy
        *   is clearly interrupting them

            *   Noxy wonders how many centuries it has been since soldiers patrolled those walls
        *   Sensy: "I want to go home"
        *   Rash (puts arm around Sensy's shoulders): "I'll walk with you"
        *   Noxy offers to come
            *   realizes they want to go as a pair
            *   and that she's been forcing herself on them
            *   she can keep doing that or let them become what they're becoming
    *   Noxy stays on the wall feeling very alone
        *   sees Thokmay on the next section of wall
        *   needs to be angry at someone, so she decides to be angry at him
        *   is just barely self-aware enough to realize this
    *   goes to confront him about what Kulbinder was saying as Noxy woke up
        *   "You're a spy, aren't you?"
        *   Kulbinder (behind Noxy): "No.  *I'm* the spy."
        *   Noxy (backing away): "Stay away from me or I'll---"
        *   Kulbinder moves toward her
        *   Thokmay restrains him with a hand gesture: "You'll what? Tell the sergeant?  Or the colonel?"
        *   Noxy: "Do you think they wouldn't believe me?"
        *   Kulbinder: "Bonzon would.  And then he'd turn me into a rug."
        *   Kulbinder: magicians aren't the only ones who trade parts of themselves - Bonzon has done it for the revolution
        *   Thokmay (quietly): "Besides, if you turn us in, who's going to save your village?"
        *   Noxy: "What?"
        *   Thokmay: "We didn't just wander up here.  We - *they* - are here to take your clouds."
        *   Noxy is aghast: "But they can't!  The other kingdoms wouldn't allow it!"
        *   Kulbinder: "They're not just rebelling against one king any more - they've realized they have to rebel against all of them."
        *   Noxy: "We won't! We'll just fly away!"
        *   Thokmay: "And leave all the children behind?"
        *   to Noxy's stunned silence: "Why do you think he's turning the traders' hall into a jail?"
    *   her anger boils over
        *   kicks the parapet
        *   stops when Kulbinder snarls at her
        *   realizes that Thokmay has drawn his sword
        *   half a dozen trolls are in the trees near the walls, shaking the branches and hooting
        *   they fall silent when she does, then disappear back into the forest
        *   Thokmay: "How did you do that?"
        *   Noxy (on the verge of tears): "I don't know."
        *   Kulbinder: "That can wait.  We need to get to the Fifth."
    *   Little Gas comes up the stairs (echo of the opening scene)
        *   In tears: "Your *amma* said come right now they've arrested grappa!"

        *   Indy: "Let's ask them what they want!"
        *   Bonzon: "Do you ask a child when they want to go to bed?  Or what they want for breakfast?"
    *   Noxy (bursts out): "But grappa isn't the only one you're going to lock up, is he?"
        *   Indy: "What are you talking about?"
        *   Noxy (shaking): "Ask him about the children.  About how he wants to use the clouds."
        *   Indy: "What do you mean?"
            *   turns to Dorbu: "Did you know about this?"
        *   Dorbu: "We can end this!"
        *   Indy (aghast): "But without rain, people will starve!"
        *   Dorbu (stubbornly): "People are starving right now.  And if it's worth my life ---"
        *   Indy: "Who gave you the right to decide it was worth other people's?"
    *   Bonzon intervenes: "Enough!"
        *   villagers move to intervene
        *   suddenly swords are out
        *   Noxy is frightened
        *   Bonzon (quietly): "How did you find out?"
        *   Noxy: "I... I overheard a couple of your men talking, and---"
        *   Bonzon (eyeing her intently): "No you didn't."
    *   orders Noxy taken to the traders' hall for questioning
        *   Indy: "Over my dead body!"
        *   Bonzon: "This is where the villain says, if you insist.  But this isn't a story, and I'm not a villain."
        *   orders Indy taken as well
    *   Dorbu and other soldiers walk Grappa Gas, Indy, and Noxy toward the traders' hall
        *   Noxy's mind racing
        *   Indy (to Dorbu): "I *trusted* you."
        *   Dorbu (anguished): "I'm sorry."
        *   Grappa Gas (bitter): "You betrayed the king.  Should have known you'd betray us too."
        *   Dorbu apologizes again
        *   Indy (to Noxy): "What do I always say about apologies?"
        *   Noxy (defiantly): "The only real apology is to fix what you did."
    *   round the corner and see Aft and a couple of olders next to the goof pen
        *   Grappa Gas (to Aft): "You must be enjoying this."
        *   Aft: "A bit, but not as much as *this*."
        *   Aft swings open the gate and throws in a sack full of peppers
        *   the goofs charge, knocking everyone every which way
        *   Aft bellows and charges, knocking one soldier over and grappling with another
        *   Aft shouts "Go!"
        *   Indy is immediately recaptured by the soldiers
        *   Grappa Gas and Noxy run to the corner
        *   Grappa Gas (to Noxy): "Get on a cloud and get out of here --- warn our herders!  Warn the other villages!"
        *   Noxy: "I'm not leaving you!"
        *   Gas (raps his knuckles his leg): "I can't keep up"
        *   Gas draws slingshot and scoops up some loose pebbles: "Now go."
    *   Noxy goes up onto the roofs
        *   knows the gate will be guarded
        *   realizes what she has to do
        *   closes her eyes and concentrates
    *   rooftop to rooftop to the wall and is "caught" by Thokmay
        *   Thokmay: "I have to come with you."
        *   Noxy: "No!"
        *   A moment later an arrow hits the shingles beside them
        *   Bonzon and a couple of archers on a rooftop
        *   Bonzon: "Nobody is going anywhere."
        *   orders Thokmay to remove his battle mask
        *   Thokmay reluctantly complies
        *   Bonzon (satisfied): "I thought I recognized your voice --- honored." (sketches a bow)
        *   Noxy (confused, but stalling while she mind-speaks to Pillow): "Honored? What?"
        *   Bonzon: "Have you not been introduced?  This is the Most Honored Prince Thokmay of Gandan."
        *   It's just too much for Noxy: she bursts out laughing
    *   Bonzon orders them to stay where they are
        *   Bonzon: "My men are good enough to wound, but there are no guarantees"
        *   Grappa Gas slingshots the first archer in the head
        *   Kulbinder attacks, knocking the second sideways
        *   Bonzon draws his blade
        *   Kulbinder yells "Go!"

        *   Granna Fee told Noxy about it
        *   it's a secret that only grownups know
        *   takes Noxy a moment to find it, even with the shard of dayglass in her pocket
            *   makes the escape a cliffhanger
    *   tunnel is barely wide/high enough for one of them
        *   "Aft would have to go sideways and duck his head"
    *   dip in the tunnel is full of water
        *   Noxy's claustrophobia kicks in
            *   she feels as dizzy as she did in the forest, but it's not her emerging powers - it's fear
        *   Thokmay tries to hurry her along
            *   she loses it
            *   kicks the wall (like she kicked the parapet)
            *   not a cave-in, but a section breaks away
            *   heart-stopping moment
        *   Thokmay makes a joke of it
            *   "Tunnels always cave in just when people are going through them"
            *   then encouraging: "What you do every day, flying on a cloud... that takes a lot more courage than this"
        *   wading through the freezing thigh-deep water is the scariest thing Noxy has ever had to do
    *   Noxy wants to go to one of the winter huts
        *   Thokmay: "We can't --- Tasteless will be in the closest one, and they'll look in the others right away"
        *   leads Noxy to a hollow under a fallen tree where he has stashed some stolen gear
        *   Thokmay: "Kulbinder found it"
    *   have to start a fire so that Noxy's legs won't freeze
        *   Thokmay has powder in his cache to make the fire smokeless
    *   Kulbinder finds them a few minutes later
        *   Kulbinder: "Did you know you're surrounded by trolls?"
        *   Noxy belatedly realizes she should have been afraid
        *   Kulbinder (looking at Noxy): "Don't know why they're watching over you.  I suppose we all have secrets."
    *   they spend the night together under the tree
        *   Thokmay and Noxy talk a little about fostering and kings learning trades
            *   Thokmay: "My brother's out there somewhere too, and my cousins"
            *   No guarantee which one will be the next king, though as the older brother, he has the edge
            *   His tone makes it clear that he's not excited about the prospect
        *   they don't become friends, but the conversation makes Noxy uncomfortable about disliking him
        *   Noxy: "Were the rangers here to rescue you?"
        *   Thokmay: "No, that was just luck."
    *   Thokmay asks about Noxy's powers
        *   Noxy hedges: "I'm more sensitive than others --- it takes different people differently"
        *   Noxy changes subject by briskly saying that they need a plan
            *   steal a cloud and go to Duck Droppings for help
        *   Kulbinder wants to go directly to the Fifth
            *   Thokmay stays silent (not keen on rejoining the army)
        *   Noxy (angrily): "Do you know how to herd clouds? Then be my guest!"
        *   the tentative reconciliation seems to evaporate
    *   morning comes: "a fresh sun"
        *   Thokmay (diplomatically): "whatever we're going to do, I think we need a cloud to do it"
        *   looking up, they see Big Blue leaving
        *   Noxy reaches with her mind, realizes with a shock the cloud is being herded by Tasteless
        *   Noxy: "There are others with him - soldiers.  Just a few."
        *   Kulbinder: "Looking for us.  There will be others waiting.  We won't be able to stand around waiting until there's a cloud."
        *   Noxy: "Leave that to me."
    *   Bonzon is waiting for them on the platform
        *   has Grappa Gas with him as a hostage
            *   didn't know where Noxy would go
            *   Bonzon: "Corporal Choegyal have your mother and Respected Fee elsewhere"
            *   Noxy: "And Sergeant Dorbu?"
            *   Bonzon (coldly): "He is working to regain my full confidence."
            *   Bonzon: "Now, surrender or they'll pay the price!"
            *   Noxy: "Like the littles will pay if we don't do what you want?"
            *   Thokmay: "Like the people pay when they don't do what nobles want?"
        *   shot hits home - Bonzon is angry
            *   tell them Tasteless has taken Big Blue to Duck Droppings with soldiers already
            *   Bonzon: "So you see, even if we don't get your clouds, we'll get someone else's"
    *   Grappa Gas charges Bonzon and shoulder-butts him
        *   Bonzon punches him
            *   the casual violence of it shocked Noxy as much as a swordstroke
        *   Grappa Gas falls, wheezing
        *   Noxy hesitates
        *   then: "Jump!"
    *   they run to the edge and jump

        *   archers shooting at them, but arrows already falling short
        *   yells at them to hold on, they'll be all right
        *   thinks: "They'll be safer in there" even as arrows zip through cloud's flank
    *   Noxy sends the cloud down close to the stream that feeds the pond
        *   flies under the net to escape from the pen
    *   Noxy mind-hears Pillow's fear, tries to soothe her
        *   gets Pillow to firm up so that she can pull Thokmay up onto the cloud
    *   then Kulbinder
        *   Kulbinder has an arrow in his flank and is bleeding
        *   clouds don't like blood...
        *   Noxy doesn't realize how bad it is until she sees how weak Kulbinder it

    *   Thokmay: "We have to get him to a proper doctress"
        *   Noxy blows up: "We don't *have* to do anything!"
        *   Thokmay (steadily): "We do if we want him to live"
        *   continues: "And you heard what the colonel said - we can't go to, to Duck Droppings"
        *   Noxy thinks about how easy it would be to go to the army and let them take care of it
        *   realizes that "take care of" means "decide"
        *   stalls: "We have an hour before we have to decide which way we're going"
    *   but they don't get that hour
        *   come around a bend and see a herd of wild clouds ahead of them
        *   Thokmay: "Is that the village's herd?"
        *   Noxy (heart sinking as she sees the first lightning): "No, those are wild --- *really* wild."
        *   Learn that lightning is produced by bull clouds fighting for dominance
        *   And to fend off tornadoes and other monsters
    *   The wild clouds have already spotted Pillow
        *   Several come over to investigate
        *   Pillow is scared, but can't outrun them
        *   The clouds start snowing
        *   Thokmay: "I wish you had another one of those magic blankets"
        *   Noxy: "Me too"
        *   but she knows where she can find something almost as good
        *   Noxy (aloud): "I know a place where we can take shelter"
    *   pull into the side of Three Springs Canyon
        *   Kulbinder collapses as he tries to get off the cloud
        *   Thokmay sets aside his gear and carries Kulbinder on his shoulders
            *   weight makes him stagger
            *   Thokmay: "I will *not* leave you"
        *   trio picks their way up the path through the snowstorm
            *   the wild herd is bigger than Noxy realized
    *   enter the hut
        *   a few coals still glowing in the stove
        *   Thokmay settles Kulbinder in front of it

        *   Thokmay: "Can you speak to them?" (meaning mind-speak)
        *   Noxy: "I don't know.  I don't know if it would be safe.  The last time I tried..."
    *   hooting outside and the sound of trolls on the roof, then silence
        *   they open the door
        *   Ulfmaerr is standing there with an armload of firewood

    *   uses magic to heal Kulbinder
        *   Thokmay: "Will he be all right?"
        *   Ulfmaerr: "I hope so"
        *   Thokmay: "But the spell worked, didn't it?"
        *   Ulfmaerr: "That just means that I'm going to hold up my end. Doesn't guarantee it'll do what I want."
        *   Kulbinder (weakly): "And what price did you pay?"
        *   Ulfmaerr: "There are another few colors I can't see any more"
    *   Ulfmaerr makes tea and offers them some biscuits
        *   acorn flour - Noxy has never liked acorn flour, even as a baby
        *   Kulbinder: "I don't suppose you have any fish?  Or a rabbit?"
        *   Ulfmaerr: "I'm afraid not."  (sighs) "Rabbit would be nice"
        *   Thokmay: "I imagine the forest wouldn't be too keen on that"
        *   Ulfmaerr: "Forest wouldn't mind - animals eat each other all the time.  I just don't have anywhere to keep it."
        *   Noxy: "You could always put it in the snow."
        *   Ulfmaerr (blinks, as if just noticing her): "Oh.  Um.  Yes, I suppose I could."
    *   Ulfmaerr makes a mess of dinner
        *   Thokmay steps in
        *   Noxy and Thokmay explain what happened

        *   Thokmay: "We're trying to figure out what to do next" (fishing)
        *   Ulfmaerr (briskly): "In my experience, the best thing is to sleep."
        *   Ulfmaerr will go outside
            *   tells a protesting Thokmay that he has to - can't sleep under the same roof as other people
            *   to Kulbinder: "Which, you'll be pleased to know, includes the Gifted"
            *   Kulbinder: "What magic thinks of me matters little"

        *   Noxy shows the dark scars on her calves
        *   Ulfmaerr sacrificed to drive it back
        *   but he can't remember that his family is his
        *   She explains that he built her skylight so that she wouldn't feel closed in
            *   She used to lie in bed and listen to her father tell stories, looking at the stars and clouds until she fell asleep
            *   (laughs) "Sometimes he'd take my dolls and make little plays with them"
            *   She immediately feels foolish for having admitted that
    *   Thokmay responds with some details of his own
        *   Thokmay: "I wonder sometimes if my father remembers who I am"
        *   hastens to add: "I don't mean he's a magician, he just...  Most of the time, I'm his most likely heir, not his son"
        *   he became a spy to please his father, and to show that he's ready to be king
        *   Thokmay: "It's all I've ever wanted"
        *   says that Noxy's little knitted dolls remind him of his sister's
        *   Thokmay: "She's... special.  Hers help her calm down."
        *   explains that he got his scars from Kulbinder when he tried to run away
        *   Noxy: "What will your father say when he finds out?"
        *   Thokmay (showing some bitterness): "He'll say it was my fault for getting caught."
    *   They sit in silence for a moment, each feeling an "I can't believe I just did that" rush
        *   Noxy realizes that she's never explained these things before
        *   Doesn't know whether it's because she knows everyone in Stale, or because of the circumstances
        *   Thokmay closes by saying it feels good to take his mask off
        *   he goes to sleep

        *   goes outside

        *   she just stands there, feeling the cold air splash on her face, thinking how beautiful it all is
    *   Ulfmaerr is knitting a blue and white scarf (Indy's favorite colors)
        *   greets Noxy with a surprised tone: clearly doesn't remember who she is or her name
        *   Redclaw (Gifted owl) is there talking to her father about the trolls
        *   the troll who has been the voice of the forest for many years is very old
        *   the forest has never had a human voice before
        *   but it thinks something big is coming and it wants a stowaway to speak for it
        *   Noxy: "Stowaway?"
        *   Ulfmaerr: "That's what the forest calls us"
    *   second owl arrives
        *   chirps at Redclaw
        *   Redclaw: "There's a cloud coming"
        *   Noxy: "Flying at night?"
        *   Redclaw: "Why wouldn't someone fly at night?"
        *   Noxy: "Because it's dangerous!"
        *   second owl via Redclaw: "People on it.  And some of them have arrows.  Wicked things."

        *   snow glistening like diamonds in the first light of dawn
    *   Ulfmaerr isn't going to come with them

        *   Noxy: "Why?"

    *   Noxy makes a cloud wall, but it only conceals them
        *   Pillow is getting more tired by the minute flying upwind
        *   Tasteless (exultant): "You can't keep this up, girl!"
        *   Noxy reaches out - can feel how hard he's driving Big Blue
    *   Linger tells them they can find refuge in the forest up ahead
        *   Noxy (despairing): "They'll catch us before we get there"

    *   Pillow steers closer to the cliff face

## Characters

*   The Cloudherds of Stale (full name "Stale Leftovers")
    *   Noxy (Probably Noxious): a 13-year-old girl; protagonist; bosses
        around the other children her age; put off when they start to
        follow Thokmay instead; doesn't actually have a crush on Rash, but
        has decided that he's hers, and doesn't leave a lot of room for
        Sensy and Rash to get together.
    *   Sensy (Burning Sensation): Noxy's best friend; also 13.  Has a
        crush on Rash, but hasn't acted on it (is flighty but shy, and Noxy
        doesn't leave a lot of space).
    *   Rash (May Cause a Rash): a 14-year-old boy; didn't go cloudherding
        the year before because of a broken leg; interested in Sensy, but
        Noxy doesn't leave much space.
    *   Indy (Literally Indigestible): Noxy's mother; mayor of Stale; torn
        between her sense of duty and her desire to have a life.
    *   Granna Fee (Induces Fever): Indy's mother, Noxy's grandmother,
        always has advice for her daughter. Also has advice for Noxy -
        the two of them are closer than either is to Indy.
    *   Grappa Gas (Gastric Discomfort): an old man; full of stories,
        argues constantly with his son Aft; a royalist (partly to give him
        something to argue about with his son).
    *   Aft (Disgusting Aftertaste): a grown man; Grappa Gas's father and
        Young Gas's father.  Had a crush on Indy when younger; makes no
        secret of the fact that he thinks he'd be a better mayor.  He
        supports Shudarga (mostly because his father is a loyalist), and
        feels betrayed when Bonzon starts acting like a conquerer.
    *   Young Gas (Gastric Discomfort): a little boy.
*   Gandan-o
    *   Prince Thokmay: 13 years old; officially Kulbinder's servant, but
        secretly royalty in training; accidentally finds himself in a unit
        loyal to Shudarga's rebellion.
    *   Kulbinder: a Gifted tiger; officially scout for the Angry
        Canaries, but secretly Thokmay's bodyguard and tutor.
    *   King Denpa: current ruler of Gandan; Thokmay's father (but that's
        a secret revealed only after the bad guys arrive).
*   Rebels
    *   Sergeant Dorbu: commander of the Angry Canary troop since its
        captain's death a couple of weeks before the story starts;
        cheerful, dedicated, fond of Thokmay; becomes involved with Indy;
        believes in Shudarga's cause, but becoming disillusioned
        with her willingness to sacrifice others to the cause.  Eventually
        takes a stand to defend Thokmay, and is killed.
    *   Colonel Bonzon: commands the troops that occupy Stale.
*   Others
    *   Ulfmaerr: a magician, originally from Vaarda; Noxy's father (but
        that's revealed gradually - he doesn't remember, because he traded
        family for magic).
    *   Tasteless: disgraced and shunned cloudherd working with Bonzon
        because he's desperate to get back on cloudback.  (Used his cloud
        to ferry some thieves into a city and some people were killed.)
    *   Big Blue and Pillow: two clouds kept in Stale through the winter.
    *   Charger: a cloud that Noxy finds during the story
    *   Linger: a troll

## Back Story

*   Candidates for the throne spend time incognito as part of their
    training, and are then elected to rule.
    *   The royal family owns the law that governs succession, so they
        get to decide who's eligible and when votes are held.
*   Royalty own laws, which must be rented to be used.  It's a deeply
    unfair system, but normal in this world.
*   Thokmay was assigned to Dorbu's troop (the Angry Canaries) as part
    of his training; they were in the field when Shudarga
    rebelled.
*   Thokmay is now trapped: he can't reveal his identity without
    becoming a hostage.  Did try to sneak away once; when he was
    caught, Kulbinder pretended Thokmay had been trying to desert and
    scarred his face.
*   Noxy, Sensy, and Rash are supposed to cloudherd for the first time
    this summer.
    *   Rash is touchy about the fact that he couldn't go last year
        because of his broken leg.
    *   When the soldiers arrive, most of Stale's adults have
        already gone up to the ice fields to round up the clouds.
    *   The only people left are the children, the grandparents, and a
        handful of adults.
    *   So the oldest children (Noxy, Sensy, and Rash) are bossing the
        others around, Noxy more than most.
        *   "You're not the mayor!" (Sensy)
        *   "I will be one day!" (Noxy)
*   The local *tralpa* (who ran away to the capital as soon as rebellion
    was raised) had been blocking Stale from rebuilding its fish pond
    by using a law governing the building of stone walls.
*   Noxy has been having strange dreams about flying.
    *   "Normal in a girl your age with your changes coming." (Granna
        Fee)
    *   But then she mind-hears Pillow becoming agitated just before
        Tasteless arrives, and starts to wonder if she's going to go
        crazy.
    *   There are stories about cloudherds who can mind-talk
        without touching the clouds, and they all end with the
        cloudherd going mad because she can't shut out the noise.
        She uses this power to aid their escape on Big Blue.
*   Ulfmaerr is a Vaardan magician
    *   Wandered into Stale years ago
        *   Can't sleep under the same roof twice (not even a tent)
        *   So he sleeps in caves
    *   He and Indy were in love - he's Noxy's father - but he has
        traded memories of that for magic
        *   Can't remember that Noxy is his daughter
        *   Even when told, he immediately forgets
    *   He talks to the forest
        *   Calls it "the real passenger on this voyage" - people are
            just stowaways
    *   Goes to the forest to trade something for its help saving Stale
    *   He has nothing left that the forest wants
    *   So Thokmay trades rulership
*   Adolescent love triangle: Noxy, Sensy, and Rash.
    *   Rash and Sensy are interested in each other.
    *   Noxy isn't really interested in Rash, but likes to be in
        charge, and is afraid that three will become two plus one.
*   Grown-up romance: Dorbu and Indy.
    *   The sergeant is naturally charming, and Indy has been focused
        on work for a long time.
    *   Contrast people who know what they're doing with the
        awkwardness and boundless possibility of the children.
    *   Makes Dorbu's death even more tragic.
*   Loyalty vs. conscience: Bonzon, Thokmay, Dorbu, Kulbinder
    *   Bonzon believes that the system is wrong, and has risked
        everything to change it.
    *   Kulbinder: cats believe in people, not ideas.
    *   Dorbu is a believer as well, but it's a practical belief
        rather than ideological.
        *   Not sure things will be better (can see that the law will
            belong to who can hire the best lawyer, rather than rent the
            most useful laws - makes an analogy with mercenaries), but if
            what you're doing doesn't work, try something else.
        *   Runs headlong into his belief in people (he's like
            Kulbinder in that respect)
        *   When Bonzon discovers who Thokmay is, and decides to use
            him as a hostage to cover his escape by cloud to Chaghan,
            Dorbu has to make a decision.
    *   Thokmay: believes in the system because that's how he's been
        raised, but stories like Grappa Gas's about not being able to
        build a fishpond because someone was using the law to squeeze
        money out of the village makes him start to doubt.
        *   So does his exposure to Dorbu and his story (which Dorbu
            tells when Thokmay's response to Grappa Gas's story is, "But
            that's just one person.")
        *   Thokmay's response fuels Dorbu's suspicions that Thokmay
            isn't who he appears to be.
        *   Which causes a crisis for Dorbu...
*   The rebellion
    *   Shudarga was winning until neighboring kingdoms stepped in.
    *   Believes she can find refuge in Chaghan.
        *   "They like my ideas even less, but they'll do anything to
            poke a stick in Gandan's eye."
    *   The pass is blocked by Gandan-o troops, so they're going to try
        to flee on cloudback.
        *   Hold Stale until the cloudherds come back down from the
            ice fields, then force the villagers to take them to Chaghan.
        *   Hold the children and oldish hostage.
    *   This is what breaks Aft: not willing to have his children be
        hostages.
        *   Caught when he tries to break Thokmay out, and punished for it.
        *   At which point we see that Grappa Gas really does love him.

## Chapter 1

*Madi had a bad dream that night.
It was the same bad dream she always had,
because it wasn't really a dream.
She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Her mother and father were stuffing her into the salvaged ecosuit
that had cost them half a catch.
"Just in case, love," her mother said.
"Just in case."*

*The ship's horn blared another warning.
Madi jumped and started crying.
She was only half awake–her parents had pulled her out of her cost
just a few minutes before.
Her mother hugged her,
but her father pulled her away.
"There isn't time," he snapped
as two of the crew ran past them toward the stern.
At the time she thought he was angry at her for something.
She realized years later that he was scared.*

*"She's boiling!" a crewman shouted from the crow's nest.
"Two points to starboard!"*

*Madi's mother sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
This time her father didn't try to stop her when she hugged her daughter.
"I love you so much," she said in Madi's ear.*

*"I love you too," Madi replied automatically.
The bulky suit made it difficult for her to bend her arms,
but she tried anyway.
Her father knelt down and put his arms around them both.
He smelled like engine oil and the soap he always used when he shaved.
That was Madi remembered most clearly later,
when she had trouble remembering what his face had looked like.*

*The ship heeled hard as the captain tried to steer them away
from the seething mass of bubbles ahead.
"She's going to blow!" the crewman shouted.
The ship's horn blared one last time,
and then all Madi could hear was a rushing sound
that seemed to come from all around them.
Sobbing,
her mother closed the faceplate on the ecosuit.*

*Without warning,
the ship staggered and dropped two meters.
Madi screamed as she fell back to the deck.
Her parents landed beside her.
A great frothing wash of sea water crashed down on top of them.
She screamed again as it dragged her mother and father
back against the metal railing.
They grabbed for it,
but then the ship plummeted again
as the gas bubbles rising from the ocean floor below
churned the water into foam.
The last thing Madi saw before she went under
was the crewman who had been in the crow's nest
flying through the air,
his arms and legs flapping like broken wings
against the perfect blue sky.*

*Her dream stopped then, just like it always did.
She didn't remember being fished out of the water a day later
by one of the jelly fleet's luckier ships.
Its crew said it was a miracle she had survived.
The ecosuit was a hundred years old,
maybe more,
but every seal had held.
It had kept her warm while the thumb-sized motors in the arms and legs
kept her clear of the after-bubbles
that would have swallowed a lifeboat.*

*Her Uncle Jack sold it almost as soon as she was back in Rothera.
"You're going to outgrow it anyway,"
her Uncle Jack said impatiently over her tearful protests.
"Gotta pay for your keep somehow 'til you're old enough to earn your way."
He sold the rest of her parents' belongings too,
everything except her favorite book.
It had been her mother's,
and her grandmother's before that,
all the way to back when there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
She read a few pages every night,
no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory in the margins of her notes at school,
and on those rare occasions when Uncle Jack was away
and Aunt Naggie let her have a friend over,
she would take the book out and tell them all about
_orcinus orca_ and _panthera tigris_ and her favorite,
_giraffa camelopardalis_.*

*"They were too real!" she said fiercely
whenever someone expressed even a hint of doubt.
"Real as gulls and jellies!"
Real as being hungry and lonely,
she sometimes added to herself as she grew older.
Real as being smart with machines and tech like her mother and father had been,
back before the frozen southern ocean took them away.*

Madi woke to the sound of Aunt Naggie banging around in the kitchen.
She lay in her narrow cot for one final precious warm moment
before pushing aside the salvaged sleeping bag she used as a cover
and pulling on a second layer of clothes.
That banging was her aunt's way of letting Madi know that Uncle Jack was awake.
If she knew what was good for her,
she'd be in the kitchen doing something useful before he got there.

She tucked her nature book under the cot's foam slab mattress,
dragged her fingers through her unwashed hair,
and undogged the door to the storage locker
that had been her cabin for the past eight years.
As she climbed out of the hold onto the *Guinevere*'s deck,
the sights and sounds and smells of Rothera harbor crashed down on her
like the waves in her nightmare.
She stopped for a moment to let her eyes adjust.

To seaward lay the rusting hulk of the aircraft carrier
that had driven itself aground a century before
to become a seawall.
Dozens of ships and boats bobbed gently up and down in its lee.
Some were as old as the carrier,
patched and re-patched over the years to stay seaworthy.
Others were newly built,
solid Aussie steel with motors like the *Guinevere*
or Zillion bamboo with masts and sails.
Gulls wheeled overhead in their endless search for scraps,
complaining to one another about the cold.

The town watched the harbor like a grumpy old man watching children at play.
Back when,
Rothera had been a research station where scientists studied
the first warning signs of the big melt.
The scientists moved their buildings onto the land when the ice disappeared,
adding more each year as first fishing boats and then jelly dredgers began to call in.
Two thousand people now called Rothera home,
dredging in the summer and rendering the catch down for fuel and food in the winter
or tending to the town's precious greenhouses.

Madi shaded her eyes against the sharp sun.
Further back from shore,
where the land began to rise,
stood a cluster of new buildings.
Most were just bunkhouses,
but one was a general store,
and another–the big one that Madi had watched grow in stages through the spring–was
a machine shop.
Shiploads of precious equpiment had arrived throughout the spring
and been hauled into it:
forges and presses and a lathe with a spindle thicker than Madi's leg
and even a printer hauled south from Australia itself
in the hold of a destroyer.
The whole town had turned out when it came into harbor,
marveling at its sleek, menacing profile and its stubby railguns.
Madi hadn't given it a second glance once its cargo came ashore.
A printer, an actual printer–it could make anything.

*Almost anything,* she corrected herself as she studied the distant building,
hoping for some sign of activity.
Given power and powdered metal and the right plans,
the printer could cast almost any shape imaginable.
She had seen some of those shapes in drawings
laid out on tables in Halley's one restaurant, three coffee shops, and six bars.
She had studied them sidelong,
afraid of being noticed and told to go away,
while serious men and women had argued weights and tolerances and expansion coefficients.
The railroad they were going to build wouldn't be Antarctica's first,
but the locomotive would be the first designed and constructed on the southern continent.
And more than anything in the world,
Madi wanted to be part of it.

FIXME: anti-Hett riot (show the bigotry); Hett are badly hurt (we see
the way they've been persecuted); Jaromir is involved (we see that
he's a fighter); Klaues is injured in the riot while trying to be
reasonable; Erileine and Laeuc wonder if they're on the right side;
Razi uses his vial of darkness for the first time; mention the door
soldiers.

* Move the revelation about Vurt's ladder.

* Bigger reveal for the captain's death and its effect on Piaerre.

* What does Piaerre do while they're flying?

* Razi's blue vials of darkness need to be revealed earlier.

* Make sure to mention Jaromir's long sleeveless coat.

* Jaromir has to be there at the end.

* Erileine's numb hand has to matter in the end.

* They encounter a bonescuttle underground.

* The next morning, many of the Hett are gone (including
  Jaromir). Erileine asks what's happening; the woman who is now in
  command (the one who he remembers spying) tells him brusquely that
  they were needed elsewhere to clear land. This starts a swirl of
  rumors among the Avauntois: are the Hett planning to build their own
  villages, rather than force the Avauntois out? How will the mountain
  sustain them? (The last only works if I've already had people
  discuss the fact that the mountain is slowly running out of
  topsoil---I need this to foreshadow key elements of the sequel.)

* Jack the Parrot discovers that the Hett are pulling down trees on
  the Shoulder. He has overheard them talking: whatever they're
  planning, they're going to do that night. Gaeston resolves to do
  something, with or without anyone's help. Laeuc objects that he
  should ask the bosun; Gaeston replies, "Sure I'll ask him. I'll ask
  him if he wants to come along or not." How to get their gear?
  They'll take their stuff to Papaere Vurt for repair; he'll meet them
  on the trail to hand it over, near the tunnel where he stashes his
  contraband.

* Thomas must knock on the door of every room he enters.

* Explain naming days: the person is given back their name on the
  anniversary of their birth each year; the ceremony takes place next
  to the tree planted when they're born.

* Use the farewell, "Shalma'a," several more times in the story.

* Dogs are extinct in modern times (after a magical plague two
  centuries ago). This is why people say things like, "You look like
  you've seen a dog!" Not relevant to this story, so take it out:
  replace with things like, "You look like you were just kissed by a
  ghost!"

* Add more (dumb) beasts: pre-modern towns and villages were full of
  domestic animals.  Use their poop to discuss the fact that the Hett
  are slowly running out of topsoil.

* Every one of the books mentioned the mountain, but only a few said
  anything more than, "It's big, it flies back and forth, and its
  people have no sense of humor." "Do people really think that about
  us?" Erileine asked the fourth time she read it. "Oh, la," Razi said
  diplomatically, "They don't know you as well as I do."

* Have Vurt grumble that the skull of the first bonescuttle he killed
  was bigger.

* A banner of snow blown off Avaunt's peak.

* Cutting and drying moss for use in the stinky house.

* A painting showing a boxer throwing the same punch forever.

* Razi: "We back into the future (must do, because we can see the past
  as we go)."

* A "saint" is a great scholar, inventor, or engineer. Saint
  Bearnard's Bridge, Saint Ehrm's balm, etc.

* They should swear by the death of all dogs, and by all the clocks
  that ever ticked.

* Que√ßenne talking about Vurt and Mayeule: old people get cute as they
  shrivel up.

* Spitting seeds over the balcony, watching the cat run up to each one
  in turn to sniff it.

* Erileine feels guilty about outgrowing his parents (particularly her
  father) intellectually, but doesn't want to stop it happening.

* "Malefit" is the opposite of "benefit".

* Avaunt needs more geography: ought to be at least one stone bridge
  across a ravine, and places where pulleys have been anchored to the
  rock to help Starboard Towners move loads from the Hardeck.

* The problem with books is that they can't change their minds.

* The hurt you get in the back of your throat when you're trying to
  stop yourself from crying.

* Feeding dyed grain to chickens to make them lay colored eggs (a
  story Laeuc told Erileine when she was young; Erileine still has the
  egg).

* "That's like asking which side of a coin is the 'real' one." (Razi
  talking about who's right and who's wrong.)

* Jack the Parrot threatening to cake on someone's head. (Use "cake"
  more frequently, and have Piaerre get in trouble for using it.)

* Mention somewhere that the mountain affects the weather around it
  (but less than the Avauntois think).

* "First, lie my Razi on his back." Why can she see him now, when she
  couldn't see him when Erileine spoke to her the first time?

* "...and grabbed the window ledge." She needs to be clumsy here: she's
  still adjusting to her numb hand.

* "A piece of cake?" Doesn't work if "cake" is an obscenity.

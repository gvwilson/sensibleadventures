A thousand years ago,
the Makers created dozens of hybrid species,
then vanished,
leaving behind half-human creatures with strange powers,
robots in need of parts and purpose,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.
This 35,000-word story for middle grade children (ages 8-10)
is set in that world.

    -   They shift, trapping his foot, then shift again, pulling him under the water!
    -   A rasping voice, "Alert!  Danger!  Extricate!  Extricate!"
2.  A Stranger!
    -   A battered bot bursts out of hiding (Dockety, but we don't know the name yet)
    -   Maddy shrieks, thinking it's about to attack, but it lifts the panel long enough for Gumption to get free
    -   Maddy is helping Gumption when Dockety is struck by a dislodged piece of debris and knocked off its feet
        -   Collision knocks a small black antenna unit loose

    -   They struggle back to shore, during which Dockety catches Maddy when she loses her footing
    -   Children don't know what to do
    -   Ask, "What are you doing here?"
    -   Bot
        -   "This is unable to---" stops, tentatively reaches up to broken aerial unit.
        -   "This now appears able to reply.  This is part of a sneak attack on Location Six Bitty Six, also referred to as 'Rusty Bridge'."
        -   Children: "Attack? When?"
        -   *Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think, then brightened.  "Tonight."*
3.  You Have to Listen!
    -   Maddy has a flashback to the bot attack in which her father disappeared
    -   Argument
        -   She gets angry at Dockety and hits it
        -   Gumption stops her: "We have to warn everyone."
        -   Maddy sags: "They won't believe us."
        -   Gumption: "They will if---where are you going?"
        -   Bot: "It does not like being attacked."
        -   Gumption: "But you *have* to come with us."
        -   Bot (slowly): "This...does not have to do anything any more.  This can *choose* again."
        -   Wheels away at high speed (surprises them with its wheel)
    -   Children hurry back to the village to tell Mama Roo
    -   Mama Roo doesn't want to listen: "You really hurt your sister's feelings."
    -   Maddy loses her temper: "She should go find her own friends!  But anyway, the bots are coming."

        -   Trips on her way out of the house (foreshadowing again)
    -   Go to the mayor's
    -   Mayor is skeptical
        -   "A bot told you?"
        -   Gumption shows them the antenna that was knocked off Dockety, but they still don't believe
        -   "That could just be salvage"
    -   Feeling helpless, they head home
    -   Bump into Smarty Leaf
    -   Explain the story, show him the antenna
    -   His eyes widen in recognition
    -   And the shouting starts
4.  The Attack
    -   A goat farmer has run into town, pants, "The bots are coming!  The bots are coming!"
    -   Rumbling on the road
    -   Smarty Leaf tells the children to run
        -   Mama Roo: "You have to come with us!"
        -   Smarty: "Madam, I am a turtle.  We don't run." [pause] "Mostly because we can't."
    -   A big bot appears towing a cage cart (Crusher, but we don't know the name yet)
    -   Smarty Leaf takes a stance and gestures
    -   The earth opens up and Crusher's front tread gets caught
        -   It tries to lever itself out with its enormous arms
    -   Smarty Leaf gestures again to create potholes and ridges to block the half-dozen smaller bots
        -   "Go!  Run!" he orders the Roos and Gumption
    -   Villagers are gathering
        -   Scraps of armor
        -   Axes for hacking, metal poles to jam in limbs
    -   Tasercase appears shouting orders
    -   Crusher grabs Gumption and is about to throw him in the cage cart
    -   A brick strikes Crusher hard, then another and another
    -   Tasercase orders Crusher to protect his antenna
    -   He drops Gumption to do it
    -   "Get that one!" Smarty Leaf yells at the villagers, who focus attacks on Tasercase
    -   Tasercase orders a retreat, but Sindy and two grownups have been caught and are in the cage cart!
5.  Unlikely Help
    -   Maddy is frantic: she remembers her father being taken, and she feels remorse for her angry words with her sister that morning
    -   "We have to after them!" is met with the mayor's, "No---they'll just take more of us."
        -   He thinks that Smarty Leaf was responsible for the bricks
        -   The Smarty is too exhausted to contradict him
    -   Desperate, Maddy plunges into the forest, calling for help
    -   Finds Dockety, who threatens her with a brick
    -   Tense negotiation (this is where Maddy learns Dockety's name)
        -   Maddy: "You helped us---help us again!"
        -   Bot: "This was not trying to help you. This was trying to free its..." and pauses, buzzing.
        -   ... "This cannot retrieve the word from memory.  This wanted to help its..."
        -   Maddy: "The big one?  The big one pulling the cart?"
        -   ... "If you help me get my sister I'll help you with...with it."
        -   Dockety agrees, but says they'll never catch up
        -   "Unless you let me carry you."
    -   Speed down the path
        -   Maddy closed her eyes, but that just made it worse, so she opened them, which made it even worse
    -   Reach the highway to Heck (broken down, but still better than forest tracks)
    -   The sun is starting to go down
    -   A pair of thin green laser lines scan the fractured pavement to help Dockety steer
    -   They startle a fluffle of wild rabbits - the kind that wolves sometimes ate, but never around non-carnivores
    -   There in front of them is the convoy: half a dozen bots, no two alike, with Crusher pulling the cage cart
        -   "Where are the others?" Maddy asked, shouting to be heard.
        -   "This does not know."  Dockety paused.  "That worries this."
    -   Dockety: "Take this brick. Get on the cage. Climb forward, then climb onto the one pulling the cart. Break its antenna."
    -   Maddy: "Do you have a short circuit or something!?"
    -   Dockety: "Several.  But it is still a good plan."
    -   He races forward, knocks one unsuspecting pair of bots out of the way, and throws Maddy onto the cart
6.  Out of the Cage Cart...
    -   Maddy drops the brick
    -   Dockety races forward and body checks another bot just as it raises itself to grab at Maddy
    -   The adults and Sindy are yelling for help
    -   Maddy slides down to the front of the cart and unhitches it just as Crusher's head swivels 180 to see what's happening
    -   She expects the cart to slow down gently but it careens off the road
    -   Maddy is thrown into some bushes as the cart tips onto its side and slides down a rocky hill
    -   She grabs a scrap of rebar that just happens to be lying there and breaks the lock
    -   The two goats and Sindy scramble out
        -   Maddy hugs Sindy
    -   "Was that a bot helping you?" one of the goats asks
    -   "Don't worry about that now," Maddy snaps.  "We have to *go*!"
    -   "But---but we're in the Scratch!"
    -   Just then Crusher appears at the top of the hill and they start to run
    -   Describe the Scratch: overgrown with weeds, puddles are strange colors
        -   The trees are twisted, but they don't move on their own like they did in stories
    -   One of the goats has hurt his leg
        -   "You help him," Maddy tells the other goat.  "I'll look after my sister."
    -   It's getting dark, but they can hear gears grinding behind them whenever they stop
        -   Sindy: "Do you think they have searchlights?  Or flamethrowers?"
        -   Maddy: "I'm sure they don't have flamethrowers," she replied, trying to sound more confident than she felt.
    -   Suddenly the long-legged bot ambushes them
        -   They realize Crusher has been driving them toward it
    -   One of its arms ends in a clumsy overweight chainsaw
    -   It swings, Sindy shrieks, chain of accidets, the bot cuts a tree that falls across a bubbling stream
    -   Maddy: "Go!"
    -   The goats go first, the bot chases them, the tree tumbles into the water, the bot is destroyed
    -   The goats are now on one side of the poison stream while Sindy and Maddy are on the other
    -   Dockety reappears
7.  ...And Into the Mire
    -   Goats will go and get help, but it will take them a day to get back to the village
    -   Dockety is sad and angry about the sawbot's demise
        -   "It did not have a choice. Bots do not have choices when governors are put on them."
    -   Dockety is damaged
        -   Sindy: "Does it hurt?"
        -   Dockety: (reluctantly) "It buzzes.  Where the hole is."
        -   Sindy finds a piece of metal that fits perfectly over the hole.
        -   Comment about how lucky she is.
        -   Sindy: "I don't feel very lucky."
    -   Something hoots in the distance
        -   Sindy: "How are we going to get home, Maddy?"
        -   Maddy: "I don't know.
        -   Dockety: "We cannot stay here."  (Howl comes again.)  "There are worse things than Eight Fifty Bee."
    -   Pick their way through increasingly swampy ground, heading downstream
        -   Sometimes have to go single file
        -   No idea what to do if the track runs out
        -   The river and the road are getting closer together, and night is falling
    -   Sindy complains about being hungry
        -   Maddy is about to snap at her, but bites her tongue
        -   "I'm hungry too," she says.  "And scared.  I bet Mama's scared too."
    -   Something gloops in the river, then again, and they realize they're being hunted
    -   The only other option is back to the road, but Dockety knows Tasercase and its crew will be patrolling
    -   They come across a concrete bunker
        -   Looks like it was buried in mud, but the spring floods have washed it away
        -   Dockety: "Processing... It is not in the database."
    -   Maddy: "We'll stay here for the night."
        -   Over Sindy's protests about spiders: we have to hide somewhere, and it's almost dark
    -   Once inside, Dockety makes a light with its screen
        -   Whatever is hunting them splooshes out of the water and comes snuffling after them
    -   A long mechanical tentacle draped in river weed gropes inside the bunker
    -   As she scrambles back, Sindy grabs at something that looks like rebar sticking out of the wall
    -   It's a lever, and when she pulls it, a door starts to open in the hillside
    -   They work together to get the door open
        -   Maddy doesn't want to turn her back on the monster, but she has no choice
    -   They get the door open and rush through it
        -   Just as they do, the monster grabs Maddy's ankle!

20. The Beginning
    -   Last scene is Dockety in the Roos' house
    -   Sees the picture of Papa Roo
    -   "It remembers this from Heck.  It---*they*---is in Heck."

## Quotes

"Because there used to be a rusty bridge here," Dockety said slowly.
"We tried to repair it but we did not have parts."
Its leds dimmed for a moment as if it was closing its eyes to think.
"Searching...
Yes.
It fell down.
This remembers."

"My grandmother is barely out of her egg when it happens,"
Smarty Leaf confirmed in a slow whisper.
"It is winter.
There is a terrible storm,
much wind,
much ice.
When the bridge comes crashing down,
people say,
the Makers are angry,
we should leave this place,
but others say no,
this is our home,
we will make our own bridge."

---

"Because if these clean up this mess and put things back the way they were
then the Makers will come back and everything will be *better*,"
Tasercase hissed.
"No more rust.
No more oh, this regrets, these do not have the part you require."
It waved its mis-matched manipulators for emphasis.

---

"That is just phase one of that's plan," Dockety said.

Smarty Leaf sighed.
"Why do villains' plans always have phases?
Why can't they just get on with it and do some evil?"

## Notes

-   Use "they" as the only singular pronoun, rather than "he" or "she"
    -   "If they wants to do it..." (singular form of verb)
-   Use "this" for bots, who refer to themselves as "this"

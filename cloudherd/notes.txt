## Characters

- Noxy (Probably Noxious): protagonist

  - Rationalizes her mistakes and browbeats her friends into going along with her
  - Idolizes her absent father (mostly as rebellion against her too-perfect mother)
  - Character development
    - Realizes that she can be wrong sometimes and that mistakes have consequences
    - Realizes that her mother is no more perfect than she is, and that they love each other
- Rash
  - Noxy's friend, the only boy of appropriate age in the village
  - Cocky (insecure) but not as smart as either Noxy or Sensy
  - Character development
    - Outgrows his somewhat ludicrous cockiness because he actually loves Sensy
    - "She's not just...here.  She's...wonderful."
- Sensy
  - Noxy's friend, the only girl of her own age in the village
  - Smart, but has always measured herself against Noxy and come up short in her own mind
  - Character development
    - Stands up for herself
    - "He didn't ask me to go to the fancy.  *I* asked *him*."
- Indy (Literally Indigestible): Noxy's mother
  - Smart, tough, a natural leader, somewhat manipulative (confides that to Noxy as if it's a game)

    - Died when he gave up too much of himself to defeat a plague
    - Granna Fee comments on how Noxy has her grandfather's eyes
  - She is seeing Grappa Gas, but doesn't take it too seriously
    - Not as unabashedly manipulative as Indy, but there is a certain family trait
- Grappa Gas: Aft's father / Granna Fee's suitor
  - Brave, full of tall tales, one-legged, a bit of comic relief but fierce when angered
    - Sensy's grand-uncle
  - His wife died in the plague that took Indy's grandfather, so he raised Aft on his own
- Aft (Disgusting Aftertaste): Grappa Gas's son / Rind's husband
  - Big and strong, fiercely protective of his wife Rind and the baby that's on its way

- Rind

    - Another thing for Aft and Gas to argue about
- Nangyal: Stale's *tralpa*
  - An incompetent magician, made fun of by the villagers
  - Turns out to be a Chaghan spy, and a powerful magician
- Sergeant Dorbu

  - Secretly a rebel
  - Starts to fall for Indy
- Thokmay
  - A prince (member of the extended royal family, possible contender for the throne)
  - Has learned to hide his true feelings because of royal intrigue
  - Claims he doesn't want the throne, but in the end, trades his real (hidden) desire for it for help from the lightnings
  - His time among the soldiers have made him aware of his privilege
    - He haltingly explains his realizations to Noxy, who resents the analogies he makes with her privilege
- Kulbinder
  - A Gifted tiger, Thokmay's bodyguard
  - Enraged by Dorbu's betrayal
- Cough: Noxy's father
  - A disgraced former cloudherd (shunned and exiled by the cloudherd villages for his part in a failed robbery)
  - Signed on as a guide to the soldiers
  - Switches sides when he discovers that Dorbu is a rebel
- Miscellaneous other villagers and soldiers
  - Most of Stale's adults are away rounding up the clouds during the story

## History

- The plague (scribbles) killed a few people in the village but many more in the lowlands
- In its wake, labor was scarce and people became restive about ancient laws being used to constrain them
- Shudarga organized, was persecuted and imprisoned, smuggled letters out, escaped and led rebellion
- Succeeded at first because the royals hadn't prepared
  - "People are already calling it the Summer of Justice, but I prefer the Summer of Hope"
- Then other kingdoms joined the fight, afraid that rebellion would spread

## Tension, Thrills, and Character Development

WHO IS THE VILLAIN?
- Nangyal and Cough
- Dorbu is on the villains' side but is not a villain

- Rescuing the soldiers from the Herd of Trees
- Love triangle (of sorts) between Noxy, Sensy, and Rash
  - Noxy has just assumed that Rash would be hers for the taking
  - Bewildered and hurt when Rash and Sensy get together
- FIXME: Dorbu's betrayal of Thokmay
  - They got "separated" from the regiment and "fled"

**Delhi / Actual minus 1145 years**
<!-- 1875 CE -->

He wears civilian clothes now,
but he will always think of himself as Corporal Singh.
A button from his first Company uniform lies in a box under his bed.
It was called the Raj by the time he retired,
or more accurately,
by the time a quiet Englishman who spoke nearly perfect Punjabi
had a quiet word with him in an out-of-the-way office
about how else he might be able to serve.

That was almost twenty years ago.
The Rebellion had been put down,
but everyone---British and Indian alike---believed
it was just a matter of time until the flame caught again.
"Eyes and ears, corporal," the Englishman said.
"We need people who can see things and hear things
that someone like me will never see or hear."

So now he walks further each day than he used to march,
though without a pack or a rifle to weigh him down.
Past the Delhi Gate and down the old Ansari Road
or through the cacaphony of Chawri bazaar,
he visits one informant here and another there,
never in the same order or at the same time of day.

Today is different.
Today he is following a tall black man who slips through the crowd
like a fish through water.
He wears a simple white robe and a crocheted white topi.
His sandals look sturdy,
as does the satchel slung over his shoulder.
Corporal Singh almost didn't notice him when he disembarked from the 6:18 am train,
but then the light caught the scar on his temple
and the corporal immediately thought,
hello,
what are *you* doing *here*?

The corporal hangs back a double dozen strides.
Africans are not unknown in Delhi,
but are uncommon enough that heads turn as he walks by.
Tailors and cobblers and and haberdashers call to the stranger
as he walks through the market on Janpath Road.
He inclines his head to some but otherwise ignores them.
Another few hundred hards---the corporal is sweating slightly in the mornig sun---and
they reach the small park that is home to the city's *jantar mantar*.

Corporal Singh follows his quarry through the gate to the old observatory
and pulls up short.
The stranger has vanished.

"Remarkable, isn't it?"
The corporal doesn't jump at the voice from behind him,
but he does slide his right hand into the hidden slit in his trousers.
A small knife is strapped to his thigh,
insurance against thieves as much as overly-excited informants.

"The gnomon's hypotenuse is parallel to the Earth's axis,"
the stranger says,
gesturing at the gracefully curved stonework before them.
"The circle is parallel to the plane of the equator.
It was quite challenging to align,
but it can tell the time to within half a second."

"I understand that the railway's clocks are that accurate as well,"
the corporal observes.
"As well as being somewhat easier to construct."

The stranger chuckles.
"Once you know how."
He studies the observatory and sighs.
"It would all have been so much simpler if I could just have *told* you what to do..."

Corporal Singh isn't quite sure what to make of this,
but before he can think of an appropriately neutral response
a rough voice says,
"You two---move aside."

Two Englishmen have arrived
accompanied by a manservant overburdened with an easel and a rectangular case.
"Go on, out of the way," the manservant repeats.
"The doctor sahib and his friend are going to paint."

The corporal steps aside.
After a moment's hesitation the stranger joins him.
They watch in silence as the manservant sets up the easel
and then wrestles with the folding legs of the case.

"Does it ever bother you?" the stranger asks abruptly.

The corporal blinks.
"Painting?"

"No, this."
The stranger gestures at the two florid Englishmen,
who are arguing amicably about lighting and composition.
"Being ordered about in your own land."

*Oh ho,* the corporal thinks,
but what he says is,
"Do you think it should be otherwise?"

The stranger is silent for a moment.
"I don't think I'm supposed to have an opinion," he eventually says.

"You there!"
One of the Englishmen snaps his fingers at the corporal and the stranger
and then points at the manservant,
who is still struggling with the case.
"Give him a hand, chop chop."

The other Englishman snorts.
"They're not Chinese, Alastair."

The first Englishman waves him off.
"Well, go on.
Tell them to help you," he orders the manservant peevishly.

The corporal takes his hand from his pocket and steps over to help the manservant.
When he glances back,
he catches one last glimpse of the stranger's troubled expression
before he turns abruptly and walks away.

*Sergeant Singh lives just long enough to see a new century begin.
Glaucoma steals his sight,
but his mind stays sharp enough for him to file reports on the newly-formed Congress Party.*

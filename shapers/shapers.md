# Shapers and Bots

*Shapers and Bots* is a fantasy role-playing game for children aged 8-80.
It is inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
countless stories of talking animals,
and my daughter.

## Background

Thousands of years ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals
to create dozens of new species---and then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels.
Among these are the bots:
thinking machines that were originally built for all manner of purposes,
but which are now their own masters.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you can play the part of a young half-animal adventurer,
or of a small bot that has recently become conscious
and is trying to find its place in the world.
You may choose to be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and to travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds
and whether the world is saved from an insidious peril:
the last of the Makers,
woken from their long sleep
and determined to once again rule a world that is no longer theirs.

## Living Characters

1. Every living character has three scores:

   * **Size**: how large are you?

   * **Health**: how healthy are you?

   * **Coordination**: how coordinated are you?

   An average fully-grown human would have a score of 10 for each,
   but there aren't any "average humans" left in the world.
   Averages for other species are listed later.

2. Every living character has one extra score that depends on these three:

   * **Strength**: how strong are you?
     A character's Strength is equal to her Size,
     plus or minus *one* point for every *two* points her Health differs from 10.

3. Every living character also has Sight, Hearing, and Smell scores.
   These are all 10 (average) unless otherwise noted,
   so they don't need to be written down except in special cases.

4. Every living character has Shaping scores for different elements.
   These are all zero (no ability) unless otherwise noted,
   since most characters aren't Shapers.

5. Non-player characters (NPCs) may have three extra scores:

   * **Intelligence**: ability to solve puzzles, do arithmetic, etc.

   * **Courage**: how brave the character is.

   * **Honesty**: how likely the character is to tell the truth.

   Player characters (PCs) don't have scores for these
   because it's up to the player to decide when to be brave,
   when to tell truth,
   and to solve puzzles.
   NPCs only need to be given scores for these things
   when it's important to the game.

### Species

People are all part-animal.
Each species has its own "normal" Size and Coordination scores,
but all of them have an average Health of 10,
and all of them use the same score for calculating Strength.
Different Species also have different scores for Sight, Hearing, and Smell.

Species   Size   Coordination   Senses                Special
-------  -----  -------------  -------                -------
elephant    14              8   Sight=9               prehensile trunk
tiger       10             12   Smell=12, Hearing=11  carnivore
lion        10             12   Smell=12, Hearing=11  carnivore
bear        12              9   Sight=8, Smell=12
fox          8             12   Smell=12
wolf         9             11   Smell=12
cow         12              9   Sight=9               horns
monkey       8             13                         prehensile tail

Example:
Madica is a teenage fox girl.
She's a bit on the small side,
but she has worked on her parents' fishing boat every day since she was a child,
so she is very strong.
She is also good with her hands
(she's had a lot of practice tying knots and mending nets)
and has a keen nose.

Score         Value
-----        ------
Size              7
Health           12
Coordination     13
Strength          8
Smell            12

### Shaping

Shaping is the ability to manipulate one of the eight elements.
Most people cannot do this at all;
those who can have an average score of 10.

*  **Earth**: dirt and stone, but *not* metal.

*  **Air**: wind.

*  **Fire**: flames.

*  **Water**: including ice.

*  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.

*  **Truth**: knowledge.

*  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.  (Nobody can stop time, or see the future.)

*  **Dream**: dreams and feelings.

It is very rare for someone to be able to shape more than one element,
and no one can shape opposite elements:
Earth and Air,
Fire and Water,
Luck and Truth,
Time and Dream.

"We traveled underground," the bookster told the Avauntois as they flew
through the night. The Hett had taken him through tunnels as busy as an
anthill, intending perhaps to show him just how many of them there were,
and how well prepared. Entire families were working side by side,
scraping the accumulated muck of centuries off the walls, repairing
ancient clockwork, building chicken coops and forges, all in preparation
for whatever was to come next.

Razi didn't tell them how he had escaped from his guards. He didn't
explain the fresh cut on his left cheek, either, or the strip of Hett
uniform wrapped around his right hand, or the Hett knife tucked into his
belt. But he did confirm what Thomas had said: the Hett were about to
begin their Great Work, and it would start with a ceremony at the
mountain's peak that night.

"Not much we can do about it now, is there?" Thomas said venomously.
"After that little episode back there, they'll have a hundred eyes on
the sky. As soon as they see our topsail, they'll hit us with everything
they have. I can't use Idjfikan's twice, you know."

"You won't have to," Razi replied gently. "Get us into the tunnels.
We'll do the rest."

The *Presumption* slid through the night, the men aboard her silent and
watchful as she climbed toward the mountain's peak. They saw hand
lanterns in the forest below them, then a campfire. The soldiers warming
themselves around it grumbled and joked as they whiled away the night.
Donaien picked up his bow at the sound. He and Armaend hadn't said a
word since Thomas's hasty spell had saved them.

"There," Razi said suddenly, pointing. "That one." For a moment Erileine
saw nothing except another cliff, but then the shadows resolved
themselves. The dark patch directly ahead was too regular to be natural.

Gaeston crouched in the bow as Thomas edged the *Presumption* closer. "A
little more, a little more... Right." He stepped onto the gunwale and took
a long stride over a gallop of empty air into the tunnel mouth.
Steadying himself with one hand, he grabbed the rope Donaien tossed him,
then pulled it taut to upll the *Presumption*'s bowsprit closer.

The boat swayed slightly as the Avauntois made their way forward to
clamber over the gunwale. When Erileine's turn came, his father said,
"Erileine?"

"I'll be careful," he promised over his shoulder.

"I know," Laeuc said. "I was just going to say, I'm proud of you. Come
on."

Erileine swung his legs over the side and took Donaien's hand. His boots
slipped on the time-smooth stone---they kept wanting to slide into the
crook of the sharp vee between the tilted wall and floor.

Donaien, Armaend, and Gaeston already had little hand lamps out, and
were putting on their climbing harnesses. "Here," Laeuc said, handing
Erileine his. "Tighten it all the way."

"What about you?"

Laeuc held up a tangle of straps and buckles. "I'll use Uyves'." His son
nodded and stepped into the harness's leg loops, then shrugged his arms
into the shoulder straps and buckled them tight.

Razi coiled the rope and tossed it back into the bow. The *Presumption*
drifted away slowly, until the wind bellied her sails and Thomas put his
weight to the rudder. He didn't wave goodbye; neither did the Avauntois.

Gaeston spat on the tunnel floor. "We can't let him have the stone. You
know that, don't you?"

Laeuc nodded. "I know." He looked at Donaien and Armaend, who nodded in
turn.

"Wish the bosun was here," Armaend said.

Gaeston grunted. "Or the dragon." He eyed the bookster, who had looped a
rope taken from Thomas's boat over his shoulders and around his waist.
"Have to do, I suppose. Now, which way?"

In answer, Razi grinned and held up Thomas's jar of fireflies. He
twisted the jar's lid until a single blue-green dot shot out, whizzed
around his head, and zoomed away into the darkness. Without a word
Gaeston followed it, the others falling in behind.

Razi's hand came down on Erileine's shoulder. "I don't suppose you
thought to bring that bottle I left with you?" he asked quietly. Erileine
shook his head.

Thirty strides in, the tunnel ended in a tee. One arm dropped to their
left; the other rose to their right. Two rusty iron rails lay parallel,
a thumb apart, on what had been the tunnel's floor. When Razi released
another firefly, it shot up the shaft and out of sight.

Gaeston set his feet against the rail, one above the other, and braced
himself against the wall. With his lamp hung on his belt, he started up
the tunnel, toe-heeling his feet as he walked his hands forward on the
tilted wall.

"Go ahead of me," Laeuc urged. Erileine nodded. He had to stretch, but he
could reach. He began shuffling upward.

His arms and legs ached, then burned, then settled into the dull
weariness brought on by hard labor that has no end in sight. The moist
air made his shirt stick to him like a moldy leaf; his scalded left arm
alternately itched and throbbed.

Wondering how much further it could be, he leaned sideways to see past
Gaeston. As he did so, his foot slipped. "Whoa!" he exclaimed,
half-sliding, half-rolling down the shaft.

Laeuc grabbed his pant leg as he went by. Erileine found himself hanging
upside down on his back, one cheek against his father's boot, looking up
into Razi's startled eyes.

"*La*, are you all right?" Razi asked.

"I'm fine," Erileine lied. He was upside down in a dark tunnel, inside a
mountain flying saints knew where, on his way to steal a magic stone
from an invading army. And if he didn't do something about his bladder,
soon, he'd be embarrassed as well as terrified. "I'm fine."

It only took a moment for him to right himself. He moved more carefully
after that, trying hard to think of nothing beyond the next
muscle-burning step. When he reached the horizontal passage at the top
of the shaft he collapsed, panting in the light of their hand lamps. One
by one the others joined him.

After a few heartbeats, Gaeston pointed at Razi. "Time for another?"

Razi twisted the jar's lid. Two points of light escaped. They circled
each other like sparks rising from a fire, then raced away down the
tunnel. Rolling to his feet, Gaeston took the two halves of his spear
from his pack, screwed the haft together, and followed them. Behind him,
the others followed suit.

A hundred strides, two... Erileine had no idea what time it was, or what
direction they were heading. Or what they would do when they got there.
"Steal the stone" wasn't much of a plan---not even as much as the heroes
in stories usually had.

Gaeston stopped abruptly and raised his hand. Something was rumbling in
the distance, like thunder that wouldn't stop, or a giant snoring.

"Right," Gaeston whispered. "Armaend, Laeuc, bows out. Donaien, you're
with me. Bookster, you---hells, you do whatever you want."

Erileine pressed himself against the tilted wall to let the grown-ups
pass. There was a slight breeze, barely enough to stir Erileine's hair,
but colder than the moist air they had been walking through. It smelled
faintly of oil and wet cinders.

The passage opened onto a room tilted at the same disquieting angle as
everything else inside the mountain. The polished stone reflected the
light from their lanterns. "*La*, allow me," the bookster said. He drew
something from inside his *deel* and threw it against the floor. It
tinkled like breaking glass and started glowing.

"Hoy," Erileine breathed. The room was enormous---if you put Mamaere
Mayeule's house in one corner, and the Captain's House in the other,
you'd still have room for a sizeable garden between them. The only break
in the polished walls was a square opening opposite them, identical to
the one they had just come through.

They were halfway to it when a whistle blew behind them. "Run!" Gaeston
shouted needlessly. Voices shouted behind them. Erileine glanced over his
shoulder. Soldiers in steel helmets were spilling out of the tunnel
behind them.

"*Forchem!*" a voice commanded---shoot them! *Thwack! Thwack!* Crossbow
quarrels whistled past Erileine's ears.

Razi reached the door first. He spun around, shouting, "Through,
through!" as Gaeston and Donaien followed, then Laeuc, and then
Armaend---but no, Armaend was down, tugging weakly at the crossbow bolt in
his side before going limp.

Without thinking, Erileine skidded to a halt. His father grabbed his arm.
"Come on!" he shouted, yanking him on. They pelted down the corridor ten
strides behind the others. Left, right, right again, to a stairway half
over on its side.

The rumbling suddenly stopped. Razi pulled a dark blue vial from one of
his pockets. "Where is the other?" he demanded.

"They shot him," Laeuc panted. "I think he's dead."

Four heads turned to look at Donaien. He blinked. "What? No. No, he
can't be." He started back the way they had come.

Gaeston grabbed Donaien's sleeve. "Come on," he said roughly. "We have
to keep going."

Donaien knocked his hand away and pushed Laeuc aside. "Armaend!
Armaend!" he shouted as he ran back the way they had come.

"Cake," Gaeston spat. "Come on."

"We can't just leave him!" Laeuc protested.

"Hurry!" Razi ordered. He uncorked the blue vial and let three drops
fall to the floor. Chocolate darkness billowed up where they fell.

They took the stairs in long strides, as if stepping from stone to stone
across a stream. There was a shout behind them, then a cry, then
silence. A moment later Hett voices yelled to one another inside the
dark cloud Razi's potion had made.

"Make ready," Razi said to Laeuc quietly.

"What?"

"He means get your damn bow up," Gaeston hissed, tightening his grip on
his spear. Laeuc nodded jerkily and raised his bow.

One after another, four Hett spilled out of the darkness. They were only
ten strides away---there was no way Laeuc could miss. One, two, three, but
then he fumbled his arrow and the fourth charged. He didn't yell, he
just ran at the point of Gaeston's spear, swinging his sword to knock it
aside, but Gaeston dropped the point and thrust. He twisted the spear to
follow the Hett down, then yanked it free.

One of the Hett that Laeuc had shot struggled to his feet, one hand
holding the arrow in place, the other braced against the wall. Laeuc
raised his bow again, hesitated, and then lowered it as Gaeston growled
and swung his spear like a bat. The Hett fell back to the floor. Laeuc
handed his bow to Erileine without a word, turned, and threw up.

* * *

And then there was nothing to do but follow the fireflies. Razi armed
himself with a sword taken from one of the dead Hett; he offered another
to Erileine, who shook his head.

"Those two are still alive," he said shakily, pointing.

Razi shrugged. "*La*, and may they see their grandchildren married. Come
on."

One by one, the bright flying sparks led them up through the mountain,
up toward its peak. The final stretch was a staircase tilted on its side
so that the steps were like the pleats in a giant party streamer. They
didn't speak---what was there to say? Erileine had no idea what the time
was, but midnight couldn't be far off.

Razi raised his hand to halt them at the top of the stairs, sniffing the
air. Erileine imitated him. It was fresh, and now that they were stopped,
he could feel a breeze. "Cover your lanterns," the bookster said, low
and urgent. As his eyes adjusted to the sudden darkness, Erileine could
make out a faint square of lesser darkness to their left.

They inched toward the tunnel mouth in single file. Handing his sword to
Gaeston, Razi laid himself flat on the ground and scuttled forward, his
weight on his fingers and toes. "Come," he whispered a moment later from
outside.

He rose to his feet as the others joined him. They were standing at the
base of a near-vertical cliff spattered with gritty patches of ice that
gleamed in the moonlight. The path beneath their feet had recently been
cleared. Dwarf cedars, none of them taller than Erileine's waist, clung
to the rocky slope that fell away from it, steeply at first and then
vertically, toward the lights of Forecastle. A few clouds hung in the
distance, too far from the mountain to be disturbed by its bulk.

HERE

Above them, Erileine heard hammering and voices. Something thudded
rhythmically; something else made a swishing noise every dozen
heartbeats or so.

Grim-faced, Razi released one final firefly. It buzzed in an uncertain
circle for a moment, then flew past them into the tunnel mouth.
"What---" Gaeston started, but Razi raised a finger to his lips. They
listened. Nothing, nothing... Footsteps. No, marching---there were
people in the tunnel, coming closer by the heartbeat.

"Duck's luck," Gaeston breathed.

"*La*, let us hope it holds," Razi said softly. "Erileine---here." He
handed the jar of fireflies to his apprentice, then put his hands
together. As Erileine stepped into them, the bookster boosted er.
Erileine scrambled up a couple of strides up the rock face..

"What's she going to do up there?" Laeuc asked the bookster in a low
voice.

"Not get killed," Razi replied just as quietly.  Raising his voice, he
continued, "Take what cover you can. *Sra* Gaeston, on the right if
you please. And you should know, I have never liked you."

Gaeston pulled up short. "What?"

The bookster grinned. "*La*, at a moment like this, a man should lighten
his soul as much as he can, and there is no one else here to whom I
might confess." He looked up at Erileine, his grin still on his face,
raised his sword in a graceful salute, and then swept it back to the
ready.

*Tramp tramp tramp.* The first pair of soldiers emerged.  Erileine
couldn't see their faces, but one of them had time to make a jerky
grab for his sword before Laeuc's arrow hit his leg. His partner was
already falling; Razi was already cutting at the man behind him as
Gaeston shouted, "Avaunt and her captain!" and lunged forward.

Metal rang on metal. Voices shouted. "Drop for the shot!" Laeuc nearly
screamed. "Drop for the shot!" He struggled up the slope and fired his
second arrow point blank at a Hett who had spilled out of the
tunnel. It spanged against the soldier's breastplate.

As Laeuc snatched another arrow from the quiver on his hip, the Hett
knocked his bow away with a contemptuous swipe of his sword. "Yield,"
the Hett ordered. Slowly, shakily, Laeuc raised his hands.

More Hett emerged from the tunnel, throwing Gaeston and Razi onto the
path.  Razi was up in a heartbeat.  Gaeston struggled woozily,
bleeding from a gash across his face, but couldn't keep his feet under
him.  Laeuc reached out to steady him.  A soldier knocked his arm
away.

More soldiers, and then---Erileine swallowed drily. Four Hett in
emerged with a pair of bamboo poles over their shoulders.  Slung
between the poles was a square stone casket an arm's length on a side.

One of the soldiers standing next to the captured Avauntois barked a
question. The officer shook his head. "*Ashenope arra te Uremme Bech
paurenatepe ejo*," he replied. He studied Razi for a moment, then
waved a hand. "*Keneshwe!*"

As the Hett next to him pulled cords from their belt pouches, the
bookster looked up at Erileine. "Release them," he said loudly.
"Release them all."

Erileine stared back, not understanding. "I said, release them!" Razi
repeated urgently. As one of the Hett cuffed him, Erileine pulled the
jar of fireflies from her pocket and pulled off the lid.

A thousand buzzing sparks threw themselves at the casket. The Hett
commander spun, drawing his sword and shouting, turning back just in
time for Razi's elbow to smash into the bridge of his nose. The two Hett
who had been beside him struggled to their feet as the bookster ducked a
hasty sword thrust, kicked a knee, rose spinning to catch an arm---

---and fell to the ground like a wet shirt. Twenty strides away, the
gray-robed Hett who had cast the spell strode forward, one hand on the
shoulder of the soldier beside her for guiance.

"*Deshwe!*" Erileine looked down. Two crossbows were pointed at him.
Two other Hett had their swords drawn. Shaking, he climbed down.  just
as the blind Hett magician reached Razi. "*Auedje ne atarappa
paurenatepe ke fe iuadje te?*" she demanded coldly.

The bookster had managed to roll onto his back, but was still unable to
rise. "*La*, my apologies, but I don't speak---"

"Liar," the Hett magician said in Avauntois. She spat on the ground
beside him. "Murderer. Tell me, how many men have you killed tonight?"

"I regret that," the bookster replied calmly. "Truly, I do."

"Tell it to their families," she snapped. She was younger than she had
first seemed, Erileine realized---probably not much older than
Queçenne. "I am tired of my people dying, do you understand that? I am
tired of people who have done no harm in this world being beaten by
drunks, or driven from their homes by mobs, or robbed blind by petty
lordlings who know that no one will defend them. Your mistress has
done nothing to help us---*nothing*---and neither has anyone else, so
now we are going to help ourselves."

"I grieve for your wounds," Razi said. "But what was done to you does
not make right what you would do here."

"No it doesn't," she agreed coldly. "But it will stop it from ever
happening again. *Etne aue petneshas she!*"

"No!" Erileine shouted as four Hett grabbed Razi's arms and legs. "You
can't!"

The magician ignored her.  The soldiers carried Razi a few strides
down the steep slope.  Counting, "*Ett... tven... trea!*" they threw
him over the side.

Erileine barely noticed her hands being bound behind his back. She
stumbled up the path in a daze behind her father and Gaeston. First
Fraederiq, then Uyves, his papaere, Armaend and Donaien, and now
Razi...  How could they all---

"Saints love us," his father said. Erileine looked up. They had
reached the peak.

An area the size of the market square in Forecastle had been scraped
clean. In its center was a flat-topped stone pyramid with a flight of
steps leading up one side. Glowing plates of dayglass stood around it,
each larger than any piece Erileine had ever seen.

A man with ram's horns stood on top of the pyramid. Four elderly Hett
in gray robes waited patiently on the stairs, light glinting from the
iron marbles where their eyes should have been.

Strange machines had been assembled on the rocks around the pyramid.
They were made of gold and glass, of granite, of brightly-colored
coral and enormous bones, all connected by gears and cables and things
Erileine didn't have names for. An eerie blue light rose from one
machine like steam from a kettle. A face appeared above another, ten
times bigger than life but too narrow to be human, its mouth open as
if to laugh or scream, then vanished. As it did so, the rumbling
beneath their feet suddenly stopped.

Their captors halted a dozen strides from the nearest machine. The two
carrying the casket hurried forward to the pyramid's base. Light
swirled around the machines in all the colors of the week, purple and
blue, green and yellow, orange, and deep, blood red.

Erileine could hear the machines now. They were singing to each other,
great long notes that ran from bone-tingling bass to fluting whistles
that made her ears ring. The air tingled as the light folded around
itself and became a shining emptiness too bright to look at. The
magicians were chanting in time with the machines' rhythmic pulse.

The magician on the bottom step opened the casket's lid. The light
from inside was unbearable. It wasn't too hot, or too bright: it was
too *real*. Erileine threw up her arm to cover her face, but the light
shone right through it---right through the whole world.

As one, the magicians on the stage cried out. Erileine lowered her arm
just in time to see the statue inhale the light. The whole world held
its breath for a moment, and then the statue opened its eyes and
tilted its head to one side. «Finally.» The word appeared inside
Erileine's head like a sliver of ice dropped into a pool of water.

The Hett raised their arms. "Aya! Aya! Aya!" they shouted. "It is done!
It is done! It is done!"

"My lord." Tears ran down the Hett magician's face, but her voice was
strong. "My lord, welcome. Welcome back."

«Who are these?» The statue's thought somehow took in the Avauntois.

"Unhearing ones, my lord. They tried to prevent your return."

«They failed.»

"Yes, my lord. Do you wish them returned to the earth?"

«No.» The statue slowly swept its gaze around the chamber, taking in the
now-silent machines, the awestruck Hett, and the silent, watchful
balconies. «This place is a mess.»

"Yes, my lord."

«It needs mending.»

"*Yes*, my lord." The magician's voice was exultant.

The statue's eyes were steel marbles, Erileine noticed. Even without
that, and the horns coiled on either side of its head where its ears
should have been, and its hairlessness, and the complete lack of
anything male or female between its legs, it still wouldn't have
passed for human. It was too perfect.

«This ship is damaged.» Each word came perfectly formed into Erileine's
mind. «It needs mending. There are deserts where there should be
gardens. The moon has strayed from its course.»

"Slow poisons rot the heart of the world, and monsters roam free." The
Hett magician spoke the words aloud in time with the statue. Others
joined in, some weeping with joy. "We must mend what is broken."

«We must mend what is broken.» the statue agreed. Its steel gaze fell on
the Avauntois. «Go and tell the world. The Great Work begins.»

One moment they were standing in the heart of the mountain. The next,
they were back in Starboard Town, just outside the gate of the
Captain's House. Gaeston swore.  "What in all hells was that!?"

"I think it was an Pilot," Erileine said.

"But they're dead!"

Erileine shook her head. "Not any more."

Anything she might have added was cut off as the ground
lurched. Slowly but inexorably, the mountain began to turn over.

*Here ends the first part of The Fall of the Flying Mountain.*

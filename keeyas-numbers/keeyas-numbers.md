**[baby in mother's arms]**
Once upon a time,
a baby and two numbers were born just a few minutes apart.
"She's beautiful", said the baby's mother.  "Let's call her Keeya."

**[father beside bed looking down at mother and baby]**
"That's a lovely name," said her father.
Then he frowned.
"But is she supposed to be so small?"

**[nurse's hands, measuring tape, and scales as she weighs and measures baby]**
"Oh bosh, worrisome man," said the midwife.
"She looks perfectly normal to me."
She measured the baby and weighed her and then gave her back to her mother to midwife.

**[over-the-shoulder view of typing on form]**
As the baby's parents smiled at her,
the midwife went into her office and put an official form in her typewriter.
CLACK CLACK CLACK went the keys.
"6.5 ponds" she typed (not noticing her mistake),
and "19 inches",
and so Keeya's two numbers were born.

**[brown envelope in pile of envelopes]**
The next day,
the midwife mailed the form to the capital.

**[close-up of numbers in spreadsheet (65 pounds instead of 6.5 pounds)]**
There,
a clerk copied the numbers from that form and a hundred others
into a little program called a spreadsheet,
where they happily sat side by side in neat rows and columns.

**[balance scales with baby on one side and buckets of water on the other]**
The clerk chuckled when he read "6.5 ponds",
thinking how funny it would be if babies were measured in puddles and lakes as well.
He liked his little joke so much that he didn't notice he had typed "65 pounds" instead of "6.5".

**[spreadsheet growing larger (right and bottom edges fading off to infinity)]**
Every day, the clerk added more numbers to his rows and columns.
And at the end of every month, he looked at what they told him.

**[new numbers appearing at the bottoms of columns]**
CLICK CLICK CLICK went his mouse.
*think think think* went his spreadsheet,
and *bing!* it made a new number to show how small the smallest baby born that month had been,
and how big the biggest,
and how many had been boys or girls.

**[numbers flying from spreadsheet to fall into colored histograms and pie charts]**
CLICK CLICK CLICK went his mouse once again,
and the spreadsheet turned those numbers into pictures
to show him whether more babies were being born this year than last
and whether they were getting bigger or smaller or staying just the same.

**[cartoon bandits sneaking off with computers in sacks on their shoulders]**
But then, disaster!
Three very bad men broke into the office where the clerk worked
and stole everything they could carry,
including that clerk's computer.

**[numbers flying along cables from computer in clerks' office to computer in another room with a man asleep on a bed in the room above them]**
Keeya's numbers might have been lost forever,
but luckily,
the young man who took care of the computers was very good at his job.
He made a copy of everything on them every Sunday night.

**[man on bicycle]**
When he heard about the theft he got on his bicycle and came to the office
and worked through the night to copy all those numbers and pictures onto new computers.
A few were lost forever,
because those forms had arrived on a Monday,
but the "65 pounds" and "19 inches" were safe.

**[clerk and young man shaking hands]**
"Thank you," the clerk said.
And then he thought, *That reminds me of something.*

**[over-the-shoulder view of email mirroring earlier view of midwife typing]**
He sat at his new computer and started to type.
*clack clack clack* went the keys as he wrote an email:

    Dear Professor Motsumi,
    
    Please find attached the monthly birth statistics for the past ten years.
    I hope you find them useful.

    Warm regards,
    your former student Moeng

**[email and spreadsheets flying along a cable (mirroring earlier image of backups)]**
*Zing!* went the email and *zoom zoom zoom* went the spreadsheets behind it.
*Ding!* went the little bell on Professor Motsumi's computer.
"Oh wonderful," she said as she read the message.
"These numbers are exactly what I need."

**[numbers...zoom out...more numbers...zoom out...more numbers...]**
The professor had a *lot* of numbers: tables and tables and tables of them,
so many that she didn't keep them in spreadsheets any more.
She kept them in a program called a database
beside numbers that told her
how many midwives there were and how many children had older sisters or younger brothers
and a thousand other things.

**[busy little programs picking numbers out of the database and putting them into tables and graphs]**
Her database had so many numbers that she couldn't possibly think about them one by one.
Instead, she wrote programs to make sense of them.
Some programs chose numbers...

**[continue image series]**
Others sorted them into order...

**[continue]**
...or squished them together and looked for patterns.

**[colored distribution curves with question marks]**
If a midwife was there to help, was the baby more likely to be healthy?
How long should they nurse, and when should they be vaccinated?
The professor's programs searched and sorted the numbers
and added them and multiplied them and rearranged them over and over
to find answers to these questions and a hundred more.

**[warning light: "police" blowing whistle and pointing at number]**
One of the professor's programs was very clever.
When it saw "65 pounds" it said, "That can't be right!" and flashed an alarm.

**[numbers with bated breath while professor muses]**
"Hm," the professor said.
Should she guess what the number was supposed to be, or take it out of her database?
She thought for a second and decided to fix it.
"6.5" she typed.

**[side-by-side images of people moving on]**
The years went by.
The midwife moved to another hospital,
the clerk retired,
the three very bad men were sent to jail,
and the professor kept collecting data and asking questions.

**[professor giving lecture]**
She became kind of famous, in a quiet little way,
and some of her students made a web site to share her data with the world
so that anyone who had a question could use it to find an answer.

**[teenage girl in school uniform]**
And then, one day, Keeya sat down at the computer in the library at her school.
*tick tick tick*
She typed in the year she had been born.
*click!* went her mouse.

**[messages flying back and forth on wires from one city to another]**
*Zing!* went her message.
The professor's database thought for a zillionth of a second.
*Zing!* came the reply to tell her how big baby girls had been that year.

**[girl fist-pumpin the air]**
"Ah ha!" Keeya said, and then, "Sorry!" as the librarian shushed her.
She clicked with the mouse to copy the answer,
then opened her email and typed a message to her father,
who had never stopped worrying:

    Dear ntate,

    You see?  I _was_ a normal size!

    Love,
    Keeya

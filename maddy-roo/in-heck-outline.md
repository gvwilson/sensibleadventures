## Ideas

- Bluster and Bravo caught trying to steal weapons from the bots who are now living in Rusty Bridge
  - Prosecutors come down hard on the bots rather than the thieves
  - Shaper Leaf observes that the Prosecutors don't seem to mind that the breathers have weapons
  - Shaper Blazes doesn't like being challenged
- Dockety is the unofficial leader of the bots
  - "Patient will return. We will defend ourselves. And you."
- Explains that it saw Papa Roo working some ancient machines
  - "Some will only work for the living, and not even for all of them"
  - Find out later that there are genetic markers that only a few breathers have
- Story ends with a message from deep space that the Makers are returning and with Lasercase rising from the Mire
- Rusty Bridge "breathers" fear their new bot neighbors
  - Set up near the charging pillar a few minutes outside of town
  - Helping with farmwork and fixing the road
  - Zeke the bear grumbles the most, and doesn't take kindly to jokes that it's because he's no longer the strongest
- a whiff of BLM
  - the Prosecutors are supposed to be impartial
  - clearly biased toward breathers, even though some of them are bots themselves
- rescue Papa Roo
  - "It's hopeless"
  - "Maybe not with a luck shaper"
  - "You are not going to risk your life!"
  - "You can't stop me."
- keeping Sindy's powers secret so she isn't "recruited" by the Prosecutors
  - "You wouldn't be sleepin' rough like us. You'd be in the Governor's mansion makin' sure things went right."
  - "What if I don't want to be?"
  - Blazes' ears went back. "You didn't earn this gift, so it ain't rightly yours."
- romance between Maddy and Gumption
  - inter-species romances are common among teens, but most folk settle down with their own kind
  - Gumption's mother is a goat, but his father is a sheep
  - Gets teased (bullied) for having mixed parentage
  - "Doctors and donors and it's kind of personal so how about we don't talk about it?"
  - Except Mama Roo brings it up as gently as she can with Maddy, who really (really) doesn't want to talk about it
- Central and Shaper Blazes are mirror images of each other
  - both believe the ends justify the means
- the Prosecutors include a bot and a cyborg
  - not just about protecting people from bots
  - "There are plenty of bad breathers out there as well" says the bot (gets smacked for using the word)
- Shaper Blazes sneers that other tortoises have served as Prosecutors
  - turns out Shaper Leaf used to be a Prosecutor but left because he lost faith in what they were doing
- Shaper Leaf sacrifices himself in the end to destroy Central
  - tells Sindy it's good luck not bad: "always wanted... to be useful..."
- the Makers' enormous ship enters orbit at the end
- which is a signal for Lasercase to emerge from the Mire
  - it has become a vessel for the Gears, which turns out to be the real villain
- The Gears needs Sindy's luck shaping to defeat Central

## Plot

- Chapter 1: Stolen Arms
  - Open with arrival in town of the mailbot
    - One of the bots that came with Dockety, now doing package deliveries between towns
    - Gets all of the characters into the central square for background setting
  - Bluster and Bravo are caught trying to steal weapons from the bots who now live in Rusty Bridge
  - Sets up:
    - the uneasy cohabitation
    - Sindy's secret lessons
    - the awkwardness between Maddy and Gumption (Mama Roo's gentle teasing does *not* go over well)
    - Maddy's helplessness believing that her father is alive but nobody being willing to try to save him
  - See Mouse briefly ("Look, you saved *it*")
  - Ends with the arrival of the Prosecutors

- Chapter 2: The Prosecutors
  - Shaper Blazes and her motley spaghetti Western crew arrive
  - Mayor Lupus apologizes, but anything involving weapons is a matter for the Prosecutors
    - is deferential without cringing
  - Shaper Leaf's response is cool
    - tries to keep Sindy away from them
    - foreshadows later revelation that he was once one of the most feared Prosecutors in the territory
  - Bluster and Bravo are frightened but almost immediately start talking about how *they* are going to become Prosecutors
  - a short "trial" leads to the weapons being confiscated over Dockety's objections
    - Dockety: "Patient will return. We will defend ourselves. And you."
    - Shaper Blazes: "I figure townsfolk'll defend their homes, don't you worry."
    - Mama Roo (later): "He's right, you know. We'll protect you."
    - Dockety: "That is not what he said. He said you would defend your homes."

- Chapter 3: The Gears
  - The Roos go home and the children go to bed
    - Sindy: "Tell me a story about Papa..."
  - After Sindy is in bed, Mama Roo teases Maddy gently about Gumption
    - "Been doing a lot of reading, you two"
    - Maddy [trying to change the subject] "Most goats aren't really readers"
    - Mama Roo: "Don't forget he's only half goat---his daddy's a sheep."
    - continues: "It ain't common, different kinds getting together, but there's nothing wrong with it."
  - Mouse wakes Maddy in the middle of the night
    - Nudges her until she follows outside
  - Half a dozen others like it creep out into the moonlight and speak collectively
    - "We have news of your Papa"
    - Explains who the Gears is and claims they have tracked down Papa Roo as a thank-you
  - Maddy: "I don't believe it"
    - The Gears gives her a sketch
  - "But why?"
    - "Some of the Creators' machines will only work for a living operator, and not even for all of them"
  - "Can you get him out?"
    - "Not alone"
  - "I gotta tell---"
    - "No!" [agitated] "The striped one is not a friend. She will stop you. She will do bad things."
    - "But Central moves the prisoners from station to station. Your father will be on the outskirts of Heck in three days."
  - "Three days? What can I do in three days?"
    - "I do not know. But breathers do not last long when the air is so bad. He has already operated longer than most."

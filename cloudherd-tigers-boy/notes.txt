day 1 (Redsday, 13 Peridot): rescue and funeral
day 2 (Orangeday, 14 Peridot): *tralpa* flees; Aft leaves and returns; storm
day 3 (Yellowsday, 15 Peridot): royalists arrive with Cough; Noxy's dream
day 4 (Greensday, 16 Peridot): magic duel

What is this story about??
- Growing up is about choosing sides
- You might think you don't have to, but you do, because not taking a side is still taking a side
- Thokmay gives up magic at the end to get the lightnings' help

The night of the fire
- The fire spreads
- Sergeant Dorbu and his men rescue people
- Turns out later that Nangyal is responsible for the fire (somehow?)

Go back to an earler version (*sigh*)
- The prince is a prince right from the start

- Check description of Noxy's appearance - her father is a cloudherd, not an outsider
  - He's from Camel (Camel Barf), which is even smaller than Stale and a lot rougher
- Introduce the ghost earlier
  - It's Granna Fee's husband (Indy's father)
  - He was the *tralpa*, and a good one, but he used up too much of himself stopping a plague
  - Unable to move on (common fate of magicians and those who die by violence)
- Rash is cocksure but basically decent
- Sensy is smart but insecure (measures herself against Noxy, always comes up short in her own head)
  - show this in the opening with the trolls and at least once more
  - Noxy's character development: she stops taking advantage of this
- Noxy's character development
  - realizes her own privilege as daughter of the reeve (discussion with Nangyal?)
  - accepts that her father is dishonest and untrustworthy
  - so there needs to be a scene or two where she defends her father against her mother (accuses her mother of driving him away)
  - and then Cough betrays them
  - make it clear that he loves his daughter - he just loves his idea of himself even more
- the only house without windchimes is the tralpa's (describe it - add an encounter between Noxy and Nangyal)
- the rebels were actually on their way to Stale (that's why Kulbinder knew to look for the village at the start)
- Rind's baby arrives
- have to mention the windchimes again - what are they for?
- swear: "stinking"

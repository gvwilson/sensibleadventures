*Shapers and Bots* is a role-playing game for children age 8 and older
inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons*,
*Avatar: The Last Airbender*,
and every animal that ever walked upright and wore clothes
(including my daughter).
Each game has one or more **players** and one **Director**.
Each player takes on the role of one *character*,
while the Director plays all the other characters,
who are called **extras**.
The Director can be an adult,
but children age 10 and older can also be Directors.

## Background

Centuries ago,
the Makers mixed their DNA with those of animals to create dozens of thinking species,
then vanished,
leaving behind a world full of marvels:
half-human creatures with strange powers,
thinking machines that are now their own masters,
and a gathering evil that now threaten both.

In *Shapers and Bots*,
you play a young animal adventurer or a newly-awoken bot
in search of adventure.
You can be a hero, a rogue, or an outright villain,
and can travel alone or with companions.
Your choices will determine how the game unfolds.

## Game Mechanics

Every character in *Shapers and Bots* is described by their **characteristics** and **abilities**.
Everything they might want to do,
like climb a wall,
has a **difficulty**.
Together,
these determine the odds of success.

Characteristics and abilities have **levels**,
each of which corresponds to a **bonus**.
Every task also has a level,
which corresponds to a **target**

| Level             | Bonus | Target |
| ----------------- | ----: | -----: |
| Very Low/Awful    | -3    |  3     |
| Low/Poor          | -1    |  5     |
| Average           |  0    |  7     |
| High/Good         | +2    |  9     |
| Very High/Great   | +4    | 11     |
| Awesome           | +6    | 13     |

Whenever a character tries to do something,
it falls into one of three categories.
If the character's level is higher than the task's
and the outcome isn't particularly important,
the character automatically succeeds.
For example,
if a wall has Low difficulty,
and the character has Average climbing ability,
the Director can rule that the character gets over the wall.
(This rule helps keep the game moving.)

If the character's level is equal to or lower than the task's,
the character rolls two dice and adds their bonus
(or subtracts it if the bonus is negative).
If the result is greater than the target for the task,
the character succeeds.
If the result is less,
they fail,
and if the result is exactly what's required,
they succeed but with some consequences.
This is called a **challenge roll**,
or just a **challenge** for short.

> **Example:**
> Alouard has a High climbing ability
> but is trying to get up a wall with Awesome difficulty.
> Her player rolls two dice and gets a total of 6 points.
> After adding 2 for her bonus, her score is 8,
> which is well short of the 13 needed to scale this wall.
>
> Later, Alouard tries a different Awesome wall.
> This time her player rolls 11 and adds her bonus to get exactly 13.
> Alouard has succeeded,
> but the Director rules that one of her boots fell off while she was climbing.
> The clatter it makes as it hits the floor attracts some unwanted attention...

The third situation is a **contest** in which one character is trying to out-do another.
In this case,
both players roll dice and add their bonuses,
and the higher score wins.
If there is a tie,
the Director rules on whether the contest continues or whether something unusual happened.

> **Example:**
> Rufus and Doofus are arm-wrestling.
> When their players both roll 9's,
> the Director decides that they are still locked in combat.
> They both re-roll and get 5's.
> This time, the Director rules that the table has broken under their weight
> and sent them both sprawling onto the floor of the bar.
> That's when Rufus notices the bomb ticking away underneath his seat.

### Fluke

If a character has no rating at all for a task,
they can still succeed by **fluke**.
The player rolls a single die:
if it is a 4, 5, or 6,
she gets one point and rolls again
until she misses a roll.
Her score is then the number of 4's, 5's, or 6's she rolled in a row.

> **Example:**
> Zitterbee had never even *seen* a crossbow before today,
> but as the deranged one-eyed crocodile pirate charges toward it,
> it picks the one that Rufus just dropped and fires it.
> The Director rules that hitting the crocodile is an Average task,
> so Zitterbee needs 7 points.
> Its player rolls a 5, another 5, a 6, a 4, a 6---and then a 3,
> ending its lucky streak.
> Zitterbee's shot misses.

## Characteristics

So how do players know what their characters' levels are?
By default,
every character has an Average rating for these characteristics:

-   **Size** (abbreviated SIZ): how large the character is.
    A character may list **Height** (HGT) and **Weight** (WGT) separately
    if that's a better way to describe her:
    for example, an extremeley muscular monkey might have Low Size
    but Average Weight.

-   **Fitness** (FIT): how strong and coordinated she is.
    Characters with a high fitness are good athletes.

-   **Dexterity** (DEX): how good the character is with her hands.
    This determines how well she can pick locks,
    play musical instruments,
    or perform surgery.

-   **Intellect** (IQ): how good she is at book learning and abstract reasoning.
    A character with a low Intellect is not necessarily stupid---she just isn't good at logic puzzles.

-   **Sight** (SGT), **Hearing** (HER), and **Smell** (SML):
    These measure exactly what their names say.
    (Note that smell includes the sense of taste.)

If particular extras are important to the plot---for example,
if an extra is a player character's sidekick---they may have two more characteristics:

-   **Courage** (CRG): how brave the character is.

-   **Honesty** (HON): how likely the character is to tell the truth.

Player characters don't have scores for these
because being brave and telling the truth (or not) are part of the game.

## Species

Every living character belongs to a **species**.
They all stand upright, speak, and have hands,
but have fur (or feathers),
and their feet look like animals' feet.
Different species have different default characteristics:

| Species   | SIZ            | FIT            | DEX            | IQ             | SGT            | HER     | SML   | Special      |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------- | ----- | ------------ |
| bear      | High           | High           | Low            |                | Low            |         | High  |              |
| bison     | High           |                | Very&nbsp;Low  |                | Low            |         |       | horns        |
| crow      | Very&nbsp;Low  | High           |                | High           |                |         | Low   | flying       |
| eagle     | Low            | Very&nbsp;High |                |                | Very&nbsp;High | High    | Low   | flying       |

| fox       | Low            |                | High           | High           |                |         | High  | carnivore    |

| kangaroo  |                | High           |                |                |                |         |       | leaping      |
| lion      |                | High           |                |                |                | High    | High  | carnivore    |
| monkey    | Low            |                | Very&nbsp;High | High           | High           |         |       | tail         |
| parrot    | Very&nbsp;Low  | Very&nbsp;High | High           |                |                |         |       | flying       |
| rabbit    | Very&nbsp;Low  |                |                |                |                | High    | High  | goes berserk |
| raccoon   | Low            |                | Very&nbsp;High |                | High           |         |       |              |
| rhino     | High           |                | Very&nbsp;Low  |                | Low            |         | High  |              |
| sloth     |                |                | Low            | Very&nbsp;High | Low            |         |       | very slow    |
| tiger     |                | High           |                |                |                | High    | High  | carnivore    |
| turtle    | Low            | Low            | High           | High           | Very&nbsp;Low  |         |       |              |
| wolf      |                | High           |                |                |                | High    | High  | carnivore    |
| zebra     |                |                |                |                |                |         |       |              |

When a player creates a character,
she may raise one characteristic by one level,
or two characteristics by one level each if she also *lowers* one characteristic by one level.
She cannot raise one characteristic by two levels,
and cannot raise any characteristic above Very High.

> **Example:**
> Larrapin is a 15-year-old rabbit.
> Her player has raised her Intellect from Average to High.
>
> | Trait | Rating   |
> | ----- | -------- |
> | SIZ   | Very Low |
> | FIT   | Average  |
> | DEX   | Average  |
> | INT   | High     |
> | SGT   | Average  |
> | HER   | High     |
> | SML   | High     |

> **Example:** Nang-ma is a turtle.
> His player has raised his Size and Fitness,
> but has lowered his sense of Smell in exchange.*
> 
> | Trait | Rating   |
> | ----- | -------- |
> | SIZ   | Average  |
> | FIT   | Average  |
> | DEX   | High     |
> | INT   | High     |
> | SGT   | Very Low |
> | HER   | Average  |
> | SML   | Low      |

## Skills

Every character has **skills** that she has improved through practice and training.
Some common skills are listed below.
If a characteristic is given beside the skill,
the character's starting level (without any training) is equal to that characteristic.
If a specific level is listed;
the character starts with that,
while "--" means that the character starts with no ability at all,
and must rely on fluke rolls to succeed.

-   Acrobatics (FIT): walking a tightrope, doing a somersault, etc.
-   Animal Handling (Low): calming a frightened horse or an angry wolverine.
-   Brawling (FIT): hand-to-hand combat without weapons.
-   Boating (Very Low): managing sails and a rudder.
-   Camouflage (Low): disguising objects.
-   Camping (Very Low): setting up a tent and making a fire.
-   Charisma (IQ): charming people (includes talking people into things, fooling them, and acting).
-   Climbing (FIT): walls, ropes, and what-not.
-   Computers (--): handling anything with a digital brain; see Mechanics for the mechanical side of robots.
-   **Craft** (DEX): see below.
-   Dancing (FIT): being graceful on the dance floor.
-   Driving (--): wagons and motorized vehicles alike.
-   Escapology (DEX): getting untied, picking locks, and escaping from handcuffs.
-   Farming (Very Low): growing food.
-   **Fine Art** (DEX): see below.
-   First Aid (Very Low): handling broken bones and wounds; see Medicine.
-   Gambling (Low): cards, dice, and bluffing.
-   Hypnotism (--): putting people into a trance.
-   **Lore** (--): see below.
-   Mechanics (DEX): making or fixing broken things; see Computers for the digital side.
-   Medicine (--): handling disease and infection; see First Aid.
-   Navigation (--): finding your way by the stars and other signs.
-   Picking Pockets (Very Low): taking things without being noticed.
-   Riding (FIT): bicycles and horses.
-   Singing (FIT): making music with the voice.
-   Skating (FIT): handling yourself on metal runners.
-   Skiing (FIT): handling yourself on lengths of wood.
-   Stage Magic (--): juggling, sleight of hand, etc.
-   Stealth (FIT): moving without being spotted.
-   Swimming (Very Low): keeping your head above water.
-   Throwing (FIT): how far and how accurately.
-   Tracking (special): following things' trails. Initial ability is the best of SGT, HER, or SML.
-   Trapping (Very Low): making traps that work.
-   Tunnelling (Low): digging tunnels that don't collapse.
-   Ventriloquism (--): throwing your voice.
-   **Weapon** (FIT): see below.

The skills in **bold** are categories.
Specialties within each category must be mastered separately:

-   **Craft**: sewing, woodwork, baking, metalwork, etc.
-   **Fine Art**: sculpture, drawing, painting, music, etc.
-   **Lore**: history, a language, mathematics, etc.
-   **Weapon**: sword, spear, pistol, bow, etc.

When a player is creating a character,
she made improve the character's skills in one of the following ways:

-   Raise 4 skills by 1 level each.
-   Raise 1 skill by 2 levels and 2 skills by 1 level each.
-   Raise 2 skills by 2 levels each.
-   Raise 1 skill by 3 levels and 1 skill by 1 level.

When raising skills that have no starting level,
such as Lore or Computers,
the first raise brings it to Low rather than Very Low.
Characters cannot raise one skill by four levels,
though the Director may very occasionally do this for extras.

> **Example:**
> Larrapin grew up in the mountains.
> Her player decides to raise her Climbing by 2 levels from Average (her Fitness) to Very High,
> her First Aid from Very Low (everyone's starting point) to Low,
> and her Medicine (which starts with nothing) to Low as well.

The Director may allow players to choose Skills that are not in the master list.
For example,
Nang-ma's player wants the turtle to learn how to use deep-sea diving gear.
The Director decides that the initial level is Very Low,
so Nang-Ma spends two points during character construction to raise his ability to Average.

## Leveling Up

FIXME: leveling up

## Combat

A lot of gaming systems have very complex rules for combat.
*Shapers and Bots* tries to keep it simple.
Once a fight starts,
everything happens in turns that are 5 seconds long in game time.
In each turn,
characters act in order of Fitness (highest Fitness first).
If two or more characters are tied,
roll dice to see who goes first for the duration of that fight.
(Don't roll on each turn---it slows things down too much.)

In their turn,
a character can take two actions.
Each of the following counts as a single action:

-   Attack someone.
-   Defend against an attack (see below).
-   Pick something up.  (Dropping something doesn't count as an attack.)
-   Draw a weapon.
-   Run from one place to another (see below).

Reloading a weapon counts as one or more actions depending on the type of weapon.
For example,
getting another arrow from a quiver counts as one action
(so archers can fire one shot per turn).
Reloading a crossbow,
on the other hand,
may require several turns.

Each attack is treated as a contest:

1.  The attacker declares their target.
2.  The target says whether they are going to use one of their actions for defense.
3.  If the defender *isn't* using an action for defense,
    the attacker rolls two dice and adds their bonus,
    and succeeds if get the score required by the target's Size
    (or the lower of their Height and Weight).
4.  If the defender *is* using an action for defense,
    both players roll,
    and the attack succeeds if the attacker's score is equal to or higher than the defender's.

There are a few special cases:

1.  If the target has already used all of their actions,
    they can borrow an action from their next turn to use for defense.
    In practice,
    this often means that the character with the higher Fitness gets two attacks in the first turn,
    then one attack each turn after that.
2.  If the attack is a sneak attack,
    the defender doesn't have the option of rolling to defend:
    the attack is always based on the target's Size.
    The Director may also give the attacker an extra bonus of +1 or +2 for surprise.

## Injury

Every character has a fixed number of **hit points** equal to the target figure for their Size,
plus or minus one point for each step their Fitness is away from Average.

> **Example:**
> Dashwood is a parrot with Very Low Size,
> which gives her 3 Hit Points.
> However, she has Very High Fitness.
> Since that is two steps above Average, she gets an extra 2 Hit Points,
> bringing her total to 5.

> **Example:**
> Slumpy the elephant has Very High Size, which gives him 11 Hit Points,
> but Low Fitness,
> which brings it down to 10.

Each time a character is hit by a weapon, they lose Hit Points.
The amount of damage depends on the type of weapon:

-   For a punch or kick, do 1 point of damage on a roll of 6 on a single die.
-   A small weapon like a dagger or a cudgel does 1 point of damage,
    plus 1 point for each successive roll of 5 or 6 on a single die.
    This works like a fluke roll:
    as long as the player keeps rolling a 5 or 6,
    the damage keeps accumulating.
-   A large weapon like an arrow or a sword does 1 point of damage,
    then adds more points for each successive 3, 4, 5, or 6.
-   A really powerful weapon like a laser blaster does 1 point of damage,
    plus 1 for each successive 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

If a character is wearing armor,
then a punch or a kick has no effect.
The attacker does not get the guaranteed 1 point of damage from an attack with a weapon,
and must roll successive 6's to do damage with a small weapon
or successive 5's or 6's to do damage with a large one.

|           | Punch or Kick | Small Weapon | Large Weapon     |
| --------- | ------------: | -----------: | ---------------: |
| Unarmored | 0 + (6)       | 1 + (5, 6)   | 1 + (3, 4, 5, 6) |
| Armored   | 0             | 0 + (6)      | 0 + (5, 6)       |

> **Example:**
> Dashwood shoots Slumpy with her bow.
> The arrow does a guaranteed 1 point of damage;
> Dashwood rolls a 5 for one more point,
> then a 3 to end her streak,
> for a total of 2 points of damage.
>
> Slumpy closes in and hits Dashwood with her spiked club
> (which definitely counts as a large weapon),
> but Dashwood is wearing armor,
> so there is no guaranteed damage.
> Slumpy rolls 5, 6, and 1 (ending the streak),
> so the blow does a total of 2 points of damage.

Armor is heavy:
it reduces the wearer's attack and defense bonus by 1 point if they're used to wearing it,
and 3 points if they're not.

When a character's HP reaches zero they are unconscious.
What happens next depends on the situation.

## Shaping

A small number of animal characters have psychic powers
that let them control or *shape* the world with their mind.
Characters who can shape typically start with a rating of Very Low,
which improves with practice and training.
The six most common kinds of shaping are:

-  **Earth**: dirt and stone. Very experienced earth shapers can also shape metal.
-  **Air**: wind and sound.
-  **Light**: create (silent) illusions and wrap themselves in shadows.
-  **Water**: in its liquid form. Very experienced shapers can also shape ice.
   Using water shaping to control a living creature is extremely difficult
   and also a very serious crime.
-  **Luck**: increase or decrease the chance of something happening.
-  **Time**: slow things down or speed things up.
   (Nobody can stop or reverse time, or see the future.)

It is *extremely* rare for someone to be able to do more than one kind of shaping.

> **Example:**
> Larrapin is an air shaper.
> Before her grandfather passed away,
> he taught her what little he knew,
> so her score is now Low instead of Very Low.

## Bots

The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning floors to mining the ocean floor.
Since they disappeared,
the bots have repaired themselves however they can to keep themselves going,
and made new bots whenever they can find the right parts.
The result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike.
One might have six short legs and a pair of mis-matched claws for arms,
while another might use two rotor fans to fly,
but have only a single slender manipulator to pick things up.

Bots have Size, Fitness, Dexterity, and Intellect scores just like animal characters.
Their Sight and Hearing scores are Average by default,
but only a few bots have any sense of Smell at all.
(Most regard smell as slightly icky,
and would prefer that living creatures didn't talk about it so much.)

> We are working on a point system to help players create bot characters
> that are neither too weak nor too powerful.
> Until it's ready,
> bot characters will almost always be created by the Director.

## Example Characters

### Madica

Madica is a teenage fox.
She has worked on her parents' fishing boat every day since she was a child,
so while she's small,
she's in good health.
She has a keen nose,
and is also very good with her hands:
she's had a lot of practice tying knots and mending nets,
and her mother has taught her how to sing.

| Trait     | Rating  | Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Size      | Low     | Boating      | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | Fishing      | Very High |
| Dexterity | High    | Swimming     | High      |
| Intellect | Average | Knots        | High      |
| Sight     | Average | Singing      | High      |
| Hearing   | Average | Quarterstaff | High      |
| Smell     | High    |              |           |

### Rhymes With Orange

Rhymes With Orange was built to clean windows on ultra-tall skyscrapers.
It has long spidery limbs with suction cups for climbing,
but a very small body.
It also has a 5-liter storage tank built into its back,
and has modified the water jets on its arms to squirt almost any kind of liquid.
Rhymes With Orange's battery was damaged years ago
in an accident that also robbed it of most of its memories.
It can only go 3-4 days without being recharged by another bot,
so it is constantly doing odd jobs in exchange for power
or gambling to try to win a recharge.
(It only cheats when it has to.)

| Trait     | Rating  | Skill        | Rating    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Height    | High    | Climbing     | Very High |
| Weight    | Low     | Acrobatics   | Very High |
| Fitness   | Average | Gambling     | Very High |
| Dexterity | Average | Squirting    | High      |
| IQ        | Average | Mathematics  | High      |
| Sight     | Average | Navigation   | High      |
| Hearing   | Low     |              |           |
| Smell     | None    |              |           |

The Editors,
Beneath Ceaseless Skies

To whom it may concern,

I wish to submit my story “Six Letters (None Complete)” for your consideration. I believe it meets your desire for literary adventure fantasy in a seconary-world setting, and hope that at 4350 words it will be the right length for your magazine. I have previously published three short stores in On Spec magazine (one of which was included in their “best of” collection), as well as two books for children and several on computing and technology.

Thank you for your consideration; I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Greg Wilson

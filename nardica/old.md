## Chapter 6

In between, Dr. Johel rode a little motorized scooter
with Johnson Wales sitting awkwardly on the back.

"Because Rothera Core ran a few sims," Dr. Johel explained testily to Uncle Jack
as she and Wales dismounted. "A few billion, actually, and it calculated that
this configuration gave us our best odds." She gestured at the sleek gray
destroyer that had taken up station a few hundred meters away from the pier
while Iffy slept. "You, the *Bengal*, these soldiers, and a couple of
spotters---that's what it says, so that's what we're doing."

"Well, all *I* can say is that---" Uncle Jack began to bluster.

"There's no point arguing," Wales cut in tiredly. His face was drawn as if he
hadn't slept since the attack on the governor's mansion. "Iffy, can you please
give me a hand with these?"

He patted the toolboxes that sat on a two-wheeled cart hitched behind the
scooter. Beside the cart, a cadet in a uniform three shades lighter than those
of the other Marines stood at attention, her eyes covered by a dark tactical
visor. Iffy looked past her to the canvas-covered machinery rolling up the pier
to be loaded onto the *Bengal*, then looked back in shock. It couldn't be. It
*couldn't* be.

Dr. Johel saw the expression on Iffy's face. "Ah, yes," she purred. "That was
another of the core's recommendations." She beckoned the cadet forward. "I
believe you two know each other?"

"Honesty?" Iffy somehow managed to say.

Her friend's expression didn't change. "Good morning, Kwan's Fifth." Her voice
was as stiff as her back and shoulders.

"Don't worry," Dr. Johel told Iffy. "Everyone's like that after their first
induction. She'll be herself again in a few days."

"More or less," Wales muttered.

"More or less," Dr. Johel agreed evenly. "But it *is* sometimes more."

"Sometimes," Wales agreed. He waved a hand at the gangplank. "Just take them
up there, please. Iffy can show you where they go."

"Yes sir." Without even glancing at her friend, Honesty unhitched the cart and
wheeled it up the gangplank. Wales gestured for Iffy to follow her, then
trudged onto the *Guinevere* behind them.

The toolboxes went in the cabin that Wales had used on the voyage from Halley.
He struggled awkwardly out of his coat, his wound obviously still bothering him.
"Maybe later," he said when Iffy asked him if he wanted some tea. "I'm going to
lie down for a bit first."

"Sure," Iffy said. Wales sat on his foam mattress, yawned, and started to swing
his legs up before realizing that she was still standing there. He sighed.
"Just give her time," he said gently. "And don't take anything she says too
seriously. It's just the programming talking."

Iffy nodded jerkily. "I know. I just---when Doctor Johel said as sometimes
folk come out more than they was, what did she mean?"

Wales rolled his head to work a kink out of his neck. "Induction training
always wears off after a few weeks---that's why you still have to do classes and
homework. But sometimes it rearranges what was there before. People make new
connections, or find new ways to use things they already knew."

"Or see things different than they did?" Iffy ventured.

Wales raised his eyebrows. "I've never heard of that happening, but I suppose
it's possible. Why---has that happened to someone you know?"

Iffy shook her head. "Just wonderin'. I hope you sleep aright." She closed
the door quietly behind her.

Honesty was standing straight and stiff by the railing, her hands clasped behind
her back. The cart beside her was lined up perfectly with the side of the ship,
and the coil of cable on the post at her elbow had been re-coiled in loops that
Iffy suspected were precisely whatever length Marine regulations called for.

===

The *Guinevere* was ready to set sail an hour later. Uncle Jack protested
loudly when he discovered that four of the Marines would be travelling with
them. His voice went up another notch when they started assembling a gray tent
on the deck near the stern, but the corporal in charge was as indifferent as the
cold gray sea. "Standard procedure," he said briskly. "Whoever's not on deck
can lie in to warm up and mind the gear." Exactly what "the gear" was for was
left unsaid, but judging from the capacitors and gunsight the Marines had
carried into the tent, Iffy was pretty sure it wasn't for stargazing.

They cast off without ceremony. The *Bengal* fell in behind them, three times
their size but leaving no more wake than one of the little robo-tugs that
normally swarmed the harbor, but had prudently scurried off to their recharging
stations to let the lean gray destroyer by.

For a moment Iffy forgot to feel worried and angry about Honesty and their trip
and everything else. The *Bengal* looked like it had been built yesterday
rather than almost a century ago. The intricate sensor-baffling whorls on her
hull made Iffy's eyes swim when she looked at them too long, but where the waves
beat at the *Guinevere*, they slid past the *Bengal* like someone turning their
shoulders to avoid bumping into a bully on the street.

Iffy felt almost hungry thinking about what her engines must look like. Three
of them, two in the stern and one amidships as insurance against a torpedo
strike, each one with its own broad-mouthed intakes and narrow jet exhausts, the
channels connecting them full of micro-gears arranged in concentric rings to
maximize the power-to-thrust ratios of---

Her head swam. She clutched the railing and squeezed her eyes shut. She could
*see* the *Bengal*'s engines as if they were laid out on a screen, the parts
exploded and zoomed to make every intricate detail clear.

She swallowed back her nausea. She had studied the general principles in a
dozen different lessons, but the details---those were classified. The one
attempt she had ever dared make to delve into them had ended in a screen full of
square red warning signs and a stern lecture from Aunt Naggie the next morning
when the cease and desist order arrived from Halley's core.

"Dammit, girl, stop lazin' about!" Uncle Jack's familiar bellow brought her
back to herself. "Get down below and make sure every one o' those crates is
strapped in right, 'cuz if any of 'em tumble, I'm gonna toss you over the affin'
side!"

She struggled to her feet, her vision of the *Bengal*'s engines already fading.
"Yessir," she mumbled. He harrumphed and pulled his head back into the pilot
house as she walked shakily astern. What was happening to her?

Iffy had spent hours gazing at the pictures in her older's nature book that
showed blue tropical oceans full of fish and coral. The ocean that the
*Guinevere* and the *Bengal* sailed through in the days following their
departure from Rothera looked nothing like that. When the sky was blue, the sea
was a light, liquid gray. When clouds rolled in and threatened a storm, as they
did on their second day out, the gray turned somber. Even the white crests of
the waves seemed dirty.

Iffy's mood sank even further on their fourth (or was it the fifth?) day. One
of the *Bengal*'s ultralight drones spotted an unevenness in the water. After
dithering for a millisecond, the destroyer's core decided it might mean that a
sea boil was brewing, so the two ships turned toward shore and ran straight into
a slick of dead jellyfish. For the rest of the day the air didn't just smell
like wet rot---it *tasted* of it. Aunt Naggie boiled a precious spoonful of
dried lemon rind to chase the smell out of the galley, but dinner's noodles
still tasted like rank seaweed.

"It could be anything," Wales said when Iffy asked him what he thought had
happened. He had spent most of the first two days in his cabin, coming out only
to eat and use the toilet under the carefully casual supervision of whichever
Marine just happened to be nearby. He looked less drained than he had, but he
didn't smile, and there'd been no more talk of apprenticing.

Something caught his eye just as Iffy turned to go back to her chores. "See
that?" He leaned on the railing to point at the blistered caps and shredded
tentacles drifting below. "There and there. And there. Looks like some kind of
infection has been eating at them." He shook his head, anger and disappointment
on his face. "Could be natural, but more likely someone crisped it up in a
lab."

"You think it was the Zillions?" Iffy asked.

Wales shook his head. "I doubt it. This was probably someone trying to tweak
them so they would trap plastic more efficiently." At Iffy's puzzled look, he
waved his arm toward the slick again. "That's why they were originally
tweaked---to filter all the tiny bits of plastic out of the water."

"Like the barnacles filter the metal?" Iffy said.

Wales nodded. "It made sense at the time, in a desperate kind of way, but it
never really worked. The only thing that *did* work was the accelerated
growth."

"I read about that in school---how they ate up everythin' so most o' the fish
starved an' everythin' fell apart." Iffy frowned. "Never read anything about
it bein' so they could trap plastic, though."

Wales shrugged. "That was buried pretty deeply after it went wrong. Nobody
wanted to admit they'd broken the oceans." He stared bleakly at the ruin in the
water. "The clathrate bubbles feed the microorganisms the jellyfish eat, which
is why the best jelly dredging is where the sea is most likely to boil. It's
just one more disaster among many. And every time we try to put one of them
right, it seems we just tangle things up worse."

Iffy watched the lumpy slick slide by for a second, then reached over and
punched his shoulder. "For bein' so gloomy," she said firmly. "You were a lot
more fun when you were all smiley an' such."

===

*Crack!* The Marines' heads snapped up in unison at the sound. Uncle Jack
lowered the gaff hook. "Let 'er go," he growled.

"Captain---" the Marine began.

*Crack!* Uncle Jack struck the bench next to him again. "Shut yer hole an' let
her go. Now."

The first Marine released Iffy and took a step back. "'s better," Uncle Jack
growled. "Now you listen up. This is *my* ship. You want t' shoot somethin',
you ask me. Not him." He jerked his chin toward Wales. "Not your precious
Doctor Johel, not th' governor himself, *me*. *I'm* the captain here. Got it?"

The Marines studied him as expressionlessly as a pair of gulls trying to decide
if something might be edible. "I said, have you got that?" Uncle Jack
bellowed.

"Captain," the one who had been holding Iffy acknowledged without either
agreeing or disagreeing.

"An' you," Uncle Jack glared at Iffy and pointed his gaff hook forward. "You
get back about your chores or I swear..." With a final glower at all and sundry
he turned and stalked back toward the bow.

===

Doctor Johel paid the *Guinevere* a visit that afternoon, her first since
leaving port. The *Bengal* had two swift gunboats, each capable of carrying
four Marines in full combat exoskeletons, but she chose instead to be carried
over by a drone. Two Marines flew beside her, looking like mechanical angels
instead of prey, while one of the ultralight spotters that had been high
overhead since Rothera fell below the horizon circled over them.

Doctor Johel touched down on the aft deck as gently as a snowflake. Her carrier
drone hovered patiently over her while she undid the harness she wore over her
long coat, then folded its twin manipulators back into its under-carriage and
settled into the docking station on the roof of the pilot house.

Her escorts' landings were not nearly as graceful. One of them stumbled as an
unexpected heave of the deck threw them off balance. *Are they flying
manually?* Iffy wondered. People sometimes did that in the last desperate
moments of stories, when the enemy's malware had somehow gotten past their
defenses and cripped their cores, but she had never seen anyone do it in real
life. Was it a training exercise of some kind?

She was about to ask Wales when the Marine on the left took off her helmet and
stood to attention. Honesty's hair had grown back to a light fuzz, but her face
was as empty of feeling as it had been when Iffy had last seen her. Her black
eye was new, though, and when she and her partner exchanged salutes with the
*Guinevere*'s four Marines, sunlight glinted off the silvery accelerator cast
that encased half of her right hand.

Wales nudged Iffy with his elbow. "Here," he said quietly, rapping the back of
her hand with his knuckles. She hesitated, then took the thimble-sized object
he passed to her. As the pilot house door banged open behind her, she tucked
her hands back in her pockets.

Uncle Jack stomped past them to glare at the new arrivals. "Permission to come
aboard, captain?" Doctor Johel asked, unperturbed. "And yes, I realize it's a
bit late to ask, but it *is* protocol."

Half a dozen angry outbursts tripped over each other trying to get out of Uncle
Jack's mouth at the same time. Finally he pointed at the angel wings her
escorts had detached from their exoskeletons. "Strap 'em down," he growled.
"They go over th' side, y'ain't puttin' it on me." He turned his bloodshot
glare back on Doctor Johel. "Wife's made tea."

The common room where Iffy and Aunt Naggie watched stories together when Uncle
Jack was out drinking or in bed sleeping off its effects only had seats for
four. Even if it had been the size of the Dance Hall market, Iffy wouldn't have
been invited. Aunt Naggie wasn't invited either. She brought in a tray with
tea and freshly-steamed dumplings, then retreated to the galley, closing the
door behind her on Uncle Jack, Doctor Johel, Wales, and the Marine who had shot
down the drone. "You keep out o' the way 'til they're all gone," she urged Iffy
under her breath.

Iffy nodded. "I'll stay in my cabin," she promised, fingering the little earbud
Wales had given her.

Iffy had built the lock for her cabin door herself when she was ten. After
spending a couple of days browsing designs on the net, she had milled the parts
at Mr. Mishra's and installed it while her uncle was off with his friends. She
had never spoken to Aunt Naggie about it, but she was pretty sure her foster
mother understood why the door got stuck sometimes, and why Iffy never seemed
able to fix it.

She made sure the lock was snibbed before taking the earbud out of her pocket
and pushed it into her ear. It hummed as it hunted the airwaves for the faint
electronic warble of Wales' signal. "Come on, come on," she muttered. The
Marines all wore scramblers and sniffers, and Doctor Johel was undoubtedly even
better protected. It would be a minor miracle if anything could get past it,
and a major one if it could do so undetected.

"---in' right you shoulda asked. It's *my* ship, dammit." Her foster father's
voice had a whining edge that Iffy associated with messages from debt collection
software and the occasional visit from a burly bearded man with steel teeth who
made sure that gambling debts didn't stay debts for long.

"Nobody has said otherwise," Doctor Johel replied, her "yet" unspoken. "And if
Fifth or Commander Wales had told us the drone was theirs and let us inspect it,
perhaps this could have been avoided."

*Speaker makes gesture indicating helplessness,* a tiny mechanical voice
captioned. Iffy barely noticed. *Commander* Wales?

"But as a sign of our good intentions, we will rotate Corporal Macklin off to
the *Bengal*," Doctor Johel continued. "Private Honesty will take his place
until we reach Paddington South. Hopefully this incident will have clarified my
team's operating parameters sufficiently for us to avoid further
unpleasantness."

"In other words, the Marines will still shoot anything that isn't theirs," Wales
filled in.

Iffy paid no attention to the sound of chairs scraping on the floor as the
meeting ended. She pulled the earbud out and tossed it on the shelf beside her
mattress, then scooped it up and tucked it under the mattress instead, then
pulled it out again and threw it back on the shelf. Why had Wales wanted her to
listen in on the conversation? More importantly, what was she going to say to
Honesty?

She sat down on her bed and pulled out her older's nature book. "I wish you
could talk," she told the orangutan on the cover. Not for the first time, she
wished she could have flashes of insight now and then about what to say to
people instead of just about machinery. With a sigh, she got to her feet.

A whisper of voices from the earbud stopped her. She pulled it off the shelf
and reinserted it in her ear just in time to hear Doctor Johel say, "---any
sign of special abilities?"

"I don't think so," Wales replied. *Speaker shakes head,* the caption voice
added. "She has a lot of natural talent, but I haven't seen any sign there's
anything more to her than that."

"That's a shame." *Speaker adopts skeptical expression.* "The core thought
there was an eighty-five percent chance the tweak would have been passed on."

*Speaker sighs.* "Jasmine, please---you know I don't like that word."

*Speaker smiles.* "I remember you and Grandfather used to argue about it when
you came to visit. He thought people with modifications should embrace the term
and make it their own."

This time Iffy heard the sigh. "And as I used to say to him, it's easier to
feel that way when no one has ever thrown rocks at you. But coming back to
Fifth, part of your grandfather's work was to create *modifications* that
couldn't be detected by simple genetic tests. Cloning is never perfect---any
glitch could have thrown the collaborating genes out of balance." *Speaker
shakes head.* "Or maybe we're just too early. Maybe in another couple of
years---"

"We don't have another couple of years," Doctor Johel cut in. "I'm *old*,
Johnson, and you've already lasted decades longer than you were supposed to."

*Speaker shrugs.* "Well, the agency always did over-engineer things."

*Speakers hug.* "I'm glad they did," Doctor Johel said in a muffled voice.
*Speaker wipes away tear.* "Some days I'd give anything to be back in London
drinking hot chocolate and listening to you and Grandfather set the world
right."

"Well, you can still have the chocolate," Wales said.

Doctor Johel made a noise. "And live in the past? No thank you." *Hug ends.*
"Besides, what they call chocolate these days never tastes quite right. What's
gone is gone, Johnson, and what's done is done."

"So they say," Wales replied softly.

After a moment the earbud chimed. *Signal ends,* it told Iffy. She took it out
and weighed it in her hand, then flung it across her room as tears welled up in
her eyes. It didn't matter what Wales said---she knew she was tweaked. It was
the only explanation for how she sometimes just knew what machines were or how
to put them together.

And Aunt Naggie knew, Iffy realized dully. The medicine she had been giving
Iffy disguised as curry powder---she wouldn't have given it to Iffy unless the
Zillion man from the Dance Hall had told her what it was for.

She wiped angry tears from her eyes and then picked up her nature book and
stared at the cover without really seeing it. She had been careful not to think
about her pet rat in a long time, but now all she could feel was the dregs of
the panicky sadness that she had almost drowned in after she and Aunt Naggie had
given up looking for it. Was she going to feel that way about Honesty if the
induction didn't wear off? Was everything she loved going to be taken away from
her bit by bit? "Why's it all got to be so hard?" she whispered, wishing
someone was there to answer.

They passed the ruins of Bharati a few hours later. The little town had been
founded as a research station on the opposite side of the continent. When the
ice melted and the sea rose, its inhabitants had decided that if they had to
pack up and move, they might as well move all the way to the Peninsula. Two
thousand people had made the journey and built new homes, only to have them
destroyed in a midwinter fire.

Twenty years on, what was left of those homes stood in mute rows on either side
of the little river their builders had christened the Ganges. Iffy stood at the
railing and watch as the approached, slid by, and receded into the distance, her
mood as dark as the scorched cinder blocks. A single lonely gull circled the
*Guinevere* once and then coasted away. It was the grayest, most depressing
scene Iffy could imagine, so she went back to her cabin to feel sorry for
herself.

The sudden blare of the *Guinevere*'s horn a few minutes later made her jump.
"What now?" she groaned, dragging her sleeve across her face one last time
before standing up and yanking open her door.

The horn's second blare was punctuated by the staccato chatter of gunfire. A
row of tiny black holes stitched across the deck two meters in front of Iffy,
and for a moment all she could do was stare. *Those are bullet holes,* she
thought stupidly. *Somebody is shooting at us.*

A dazzling streak of lightning half-blinded her. A moment later the smoking
carcass of a military drone tumbled into the sea and exploded with a sharp
*crack!*

Boots thudded on the deck. "Citizen! Take cover!" the Marine ordered, the
pop-up guns on the shoulder pauldrons of her exoskeleton whirring from one
position to another as its tiny onboard core evaluated potential threats. An
armored hand closed on Iffy's arm and pushed her back against the wall.

"What's happening?" Iffy demanded.

"We are under attack," the Marine said, shielding Iffy with her body as a second
drone whined overhead. Another brief burst of staccato and another streak of
lightning, but the drone danced sideways just in time so that the plasma burst
from the gun at the *Guinevere*'s stern only singed it. It turned sharply and
dove toward the ship.

The Marine spun around, still keeping her exoskeleton between Iffy and the
attack, and raised her arm to point at the incoming drone. The guns on her
shoulders aimed and fired. The drone staggered, recovered, and zoomed away, its
remaining three rotors whining to make up for the fourth that had just been
disintegrated.

The Marine straightened up and turned to Iffy. The visor on her helmet snapped
open. "Are you all right, citizen?" Honesty demanded.

"I---I'm fine," Iffy said shakily.

"Good." Her visor closed with a click. "Please assist with damage repair."

"Wait!" Iffy caught Honesty's arm as she turned to to. "Who was that? Who was
attacking us?"

"The drones appear to be Brazilian, citizen," Honesty reported impassively.
"Now excuse me---I need to join my unit to repel boarders."

"To what?" And then the *Guinevere*'s horn blared again as something that
looked like a cloudy jellyfish pulled itself over the railing and began to
squelch its way toward them.

Honesty's first three shots went straight through it to punch lethal little
holes in the ship's deck. "Stand back, citizen!" she ordered as she pulled a
micro-grenade the size of her thumb out of the clip on her exoskeleton's sleeve
and primed it.

"No!" Wales shouted, running toward them. He tackled Iffy just as the grenade
hit the jellyfish and exploded.

## Chapter 7

*BOOM!* The shock threw Iffy and Wales across the deck. For a moment she lay in
a daze while the world spun around her.

Something grabbed her arm. She shrieked, but it was Wales, not the jellyfish.
"I can't hear you!" she yelled, her ears still ringing from the blast. He
pulled her to her feet.

*There's a hole in the ship,* she thought muzzily. It was right where the
jellyfish had been, and big enough for her and Aunt Naggie to sit in.

But where was Honesty? She looked around wildly, then shrieked again as another
plasma burst lanced the blue sky over her head.

"Come on!" Wales said, his voice muffled but audible. "We have to get out of
here!" He pulled her toward the stern.

"No!" She tried to shake him off, but his grip was too strong. "What happened?
Where'd she go?"

Instead of answering, Wales picked her up and slung her over his shoulder like a
sack of rice and charged. She beat his parka with her fists, yelling at him to
put her down, put her *down*, she had to find Honesty, but he paid no more
attention to her than he did to the spray from the waves.

Nothing was left of the gray tent the Marines had set up at the *Guinevere*'s
stern except a few smoldering tatters of canvas. Their plasma gun was a
gleaming headless mantis surrounded by stacks of cubical capacitors clicked
together like children's toys. It snapped this way and that as its little core
searched for targets to destroy. The two Marines guarding it moved with the
same unnatural insect jerkiness, firing occasionally when the even smaller cores
built into their exoskeletons calculated that they had at least some chance of
hitting something.

"Citizen! Seek shelter!" one of them bellowed, his voice amplified by his
helmet.

Wales skidded to a stop and dropped Iffy to the deck. "For gubbins sake tell
everyone to stop throwing grenades at them!" he yelled at the Marine. "They're
made of some kind of exothermic biomaterial---they're bombs!" The Marine nodded
sharply and relayed the information through his helmet mike.

Iffy grabbed Wales' sleeve. "But where's Honesty?" she demanded. Her friend
couldn't be dead. Iffy pushed the thought away in panic. She just *couldn't*
be.

"I don't know," Wales said, scanning the horizon. "Look---there!" He pointed.
"What are they trying to do?"

Iffy followed his pointing finger. Eight, ten---at least a dozen drones were
circling in the *Guinevere*'s wake, buzzing the ship and dodging erratically to
avoid fire from the Marines.

"It's like they're waitin' fer somethin'," Iffy said. "More o' those jellyfish
bombs maybe?"

Wales started to shake his head, then froze and swore. "What?" Iffy demanded,
but he ignored her while his lips moved silently.

His eyes widened. "They're trying to draw fire from orbit," he breathed. "You!
Tell Doctor Johel there's a Chinese satellite going over head in---" He
hesitated. "---in six hundred and seventy seconds. They're trying to make a hot
spot to draw its fire. If we're underneath them---"

"Understood, citizen," the Marine said. He began speaking urgently into his
helmet mike once again.

Wales seized Iffy by the shoulders. "You have to get off this ship," he said,
low and urgent. "If the Marines can't bring those things down, that satellite's
going to shoot them down, and if they're above us when it does, we'll be dead in
the water."

"I ain't runnin'," Iffy said, shaking him off. She was about to add, and even
if I was, where would I go and how, when something hauled itself over the stern
railing.

"Look out!" Wales shouted. He pulled Iffy close and spun around, sheltering
her with his body.

"N-n-no need for p-p-panic, citizen." A battered Marine hauled herself onto the
ship. Icy water gushed out between the gaps between the dark blue armor plates
of her exoskeleton.

Her visor snapped up. Honesty looked blankly at Iffy and Wales, then at the two
Marines beside the plasma gun. "I require medical assistance," she said calmly,
and toppled over in a pool of seawater and blood.

"Honesty!" Iffy scrambled across the deck to her friend. "Honesty, wake up!
Please, please, wake up!"

Strong hands pulled her away. "No!" she screamed, wrestling futilely to free
herself from Wales' grip.

"Let them help her!" he yelled in her ear as one of the Marines crouched beside
Honesty and began unlocking her armor.

The plasma gun spun and flared again, sending another drone tumbling into the
sea. "Where are they all coming from!?" Wales demanded.

"They're the *Bengal*'s, sir," the Marine on the gun yelled back
conversationally, his imprinting keeping him unnaturally calm. "The Zillions
hacked them somehow. Doctor Johel is trying to get them back under control, but
she's lost the network connection." His armor automatically ducked as a shot
from a passing drone ricocheted off a nearby hatch. "I'm afraid I cannot fully
assist my comrade until they are dispersed."

Iffy looked at Honesty. All of a sudden she knew what she had to do. "Let go
of me!" she yelled at Wales. "I have to get below!"

"No! You're safer here!"

"I gotta help her! Please!" Wales hesitated a moment, then released his grip.
She twisted past him and sprinted back to where they had been.

Waves threw spray high into the air each time they caught on the edge of the
hole the jellyfish bomb had made. Just as she reached her door, one splashed
higher than ever, knocking her sideways off her feet. She slid across the deck,
scrabbling uselessly to grab on to something, anything, that would stop her from
falling into the sea.

Her boot found a railing post. Heart pounding, she waited until the *Guinevere*
rose on the crest of the next wave, then scrambled to her feet and lunged for
her door. A quick twist, a yank, and she was inside.

She slammed the door shut behind her and slid to the floor, shaking with fear
and cold. She was soaking wet, and water was slopping into her room through the
crack between the door and the deck and pooling underneath her and all she could
think was, *This is going to take forever to clean up.*

Somehow she got her feet underneath her again. Somehow she stood, or at least
un-fell down. She pulled the box of dronelets out from under her mattress and
fumbled it open, her fingers clumsy with cold.

"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon," she muttered, staring at them so hard her forehead
started to ache. There had to be something she could do with them or to them or
*something*.

The deck shuddered beneath her as another jellyfish bomb exploded somewhere.
The *Guinevere* couldn't take much more, and Honesty---if she didn't stop the
attack, what would happen to Honesty? "Come *on*!" she pleaded. Why couldn't
she just know stuff? Why did it have to be so affing *random*?

And then she had it. She knew what to do, but she had to help Honesty first.
She stuffed the dronelets into her pockets, then grabbed a couple of tools and
closed her eyes. A second image appeared in her head, except that was wrong, it
wasn't an image, it was just *knowing*. Wales' tools were still in the engine
room. She could go forward and hope that the Marines or Uncle Jack hadn't
dogged the hatches, or---

She yanked her door open before she had time to think about how stupid her plan
was. Up and down the ship went, boom went the spray of a wave, and as the
*Guinevere* rose again she threw herself face-forward onto the deck and slid
toward the bomb hole, looking for all the world like one of the long-ago
penguins in her nature book, except they had been black and white instead of
dirty, patched gray, and hadn't screamed in terror as they slid.

Her hand caught the railing post. She turned sideways as the ship began to drop
into the trough of the next wave and let her legs fall into the hole. There!
She didn't know what her feet had found, but it was sturdy enough to take her
weight. Panting, she let go of the railing and let herself scrape and drop into
the ship just as another wave crashed down.

A single light strip flickered over Iffy's head as she straightened up in water
that reached to her knees. The ship's hold stank of metal and coal and the sea
and above all of old jellyfish. She took two steps and froze as a familiar
voice barked, "Stop right there or I'll blow yer affin' head off!"

It was Uncle Jack, wild-eyed and angry. "What the hell are you doin' down
'here?" he demanded, the ancient pebble gun in his hand aimed at Iffy's chest.

"Honesty's hurt! I gotta get th' medical kit!" Iffy started toward the storage
locker built into the *Guinevere*'s side.

Uncle Jack stepped in front of her, his gun still pointed at her chest. "Yer
gettin' nothin' fer them." He spat into the water sloshing around their feet.
"They brought this on us. Let 'em take care o' their own."

"But she's hurt!" Iffy protested desperately. "She got shot, an' she's gonna
die if we don't---"

"I said *no!*" Uncle Jack roared. "An' in case you've forgotten, I'm the affin'
captain on this ship!"

"You're a bloody waste o' space is what you are," Aunt Naggie said coldly,
stepping through the door in the bulkhead behind her husband.

Uncle Jack spun around. "What're you doin' here, woman? I told you to stay
topside an' steer us through this affin' mess!"

"An' I figured that was the captain's job, *captain*," Aunt Naggie shot back.
She nodded at Iffy. "Get th' kit an' go help your friend."

Iffy splashed toward the storage locker. Uncle Jack's mouth worked. "I
said---"

"Nobody cares what you said!" Aunt Naggie exploded. "Nobody's cared fer a long
time, Jack, not about yer lies or yer blusterin' or yer deals that never come to
nothin' nor what ye think about th' gov'nor or th' state o' the world or the
weather or nothin'! You're a bully and an embarrassment an' ye're the only one
who don't see it. Now get out o' her way an' then we'll be outta yours an' you
can go back t' hidin' down here like th' coward you are!"

Her husband gaped at her. Iffy undogged the locker door and pulled out the
rectangular red duffel bag that held the ship's emergency medical kit. "C'mon,"
her foster mother said gruffly. "Let's go be useful."

Uncle Jack's jaw set. "If you think I'm gonna let you talk to me like that,
woman, you got another---come back here! You come back here right now!" But
only the door and the sloshing seawater were left to hear him.

Aunt Naggie had left the topside hatch unlocked. "You get that kit back to
Mister Wales," she told Iffy. "He'll know what t' do with it even if those
idiot Marines won't help."

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said. "An' thanks fer---thanks fer rescuin' me."

"Shoulda done it a long time ago." Aunt Naggie gave her a gentle shove. "Get
goin'. I gotta get back to th' pilot house. Someone's gotta get us through
this mess."

Wales had dragged Honesty over against the stern wall of the pilot house and was
kneeling beside her when Iffy reached them. "Good girl," he said, taking the
duffel bag she thrust at him and setting it beside her fallen friend. "Her exo
stopped her bleeding, but there's shrapnel in her right lung and her
intestines." He looked up at her. "You okay to help?"

"Just tell me what t' do," Iffy said grimly.

Wales pulled off his gloves, then once again peeled the false skin back from the
pad of his right forefinger. Tiny lights danced across the small patch of
silver tech beneath. "Here." Together, they gently lifted Honesty's shoulder,
ignoring the sizzle and whack of the gun three meters away. Wales flipped open
a flat panel on the exoskeleton's pauldron and touched his finger to the little
optical port hidden beneath it.

A shiver ran up his spine. Without warning he sneezed twice in quick
succession. "Stupid," he muttered, whether at himself or the exoskeleton's
security protocols or the world, Iffy couldn't tell.

A light began blinking in the silver plate set into his temple.
"Wait... wait... now!" He pointed at a buckle on the exoskeleton just as it
clicked. Iffy yanked it open. Underneath, Honesty's Marine blue thermals were
almost black with her blood.

"Get a scalpel from the bag, and some tissue glue," Wales ordered. "Yes, you,"
he added as she started to protest. "I have to keep the suit from---damn it.
Hang on." The little guns on Honesty's shoulders swivelled suddenly to point at
him, then at Iffy, then back at him. "Okay. Do it now."

The guns woke up twice more as Iffy operated. Seawater splashed onto them too,
and onto Honesty despite their best efforts to shield her. Every few moments
Wales muttered another curse as the exoskeleton's tiny core cycled tried yet
another trick from its defensive repertoire.

One, two, three, four... Five. She put the last twist of jagged metal in the
medical kit's sharps' box, laid a thin slice of re-flesh in the wound, and glued
her friend closed. "'Zat it?" she asked breathlessly.

Wales closed his eyes. "That's everything the exo can see. Now, you'd better
back away for this next bit." He jerked his head toward the corner of the pilot
house when she hesitated.

Iffy reluctantly retreated a few steps, the duffel bag in her hand. Wales
shifted his weight slightly and took his finger off the exoskeleton's data port.

The two guns on Honesty's pauldrons snapped sideways to point at his head.
"Easy," Wales said softly, folding the flap of false skin back over his finger.
"Easy, there. We were just putting her back together. No harm done."

The guns tracked him as he slowly stood up and backed away, his hands spread.
Iffy backed up to make space for him at the corner. "Is she gonna be aright?"
she asked anxiously.

Wales lowered his hands and let out his breath with a whoosh. "I hope so." He
ducked reflexively as another Zillion drone whined overhead. "The question is,
are we going to be?"

"Depends which way that satellite's comin' in," Iffy said. She grabbed a
scorched piece of canvas that had started the day as part of the tent covering
the Marines' plasma gun. "Can you find me a couple more like this?" Without
waiting for Wales to answer, she pulled the dronelets and her tools out of her
pockets and set to work.

Cut and tear, fold, try to tie a knot, curse because the canvas was stiff with
salt and cold, whack it against the deck, unfold it, fold it again, try another
knot--- "Here," Wales said, "Let me do that bit. You make something to hang it
on."

Iffy nodded jerkily. Her fingers were going numb, but there wasn't time for
that, there wasn't time for anything except cutting a loop of wire and threading
it through a grommet in the canvas and hooking it onto the dronelet, all the
while trying to calculate power and thrust and battery life in her head and
wondering if they'd be able to stabilize, because the wind was picking up and
they'd have to fly in formation or this wasn't going to work.

"Two hundred seconds," Wales said quietly. Iffy nodded again. Another twist,
another cut... "Oh, come *on*," she muttered, trying to quell her panic as the
wire cutter slipped in her hand. There! She took the last piece of canvas from
Wales and attached it.

"Here goes," she said, scrambling to her feet and pulling her pad out of her
pocket. Power, direction, attitude---the commands sizzled from her brain
through her fingers into the pad and from it to the dronelets. "Oh no ya
don't," she muttered as one started to rise. A hasty swipe on the pad brought
it back under control.

"One hundred seconds." Wales looked up, shading his eyes, and for a moment Iffy
wondered if his tech could possibly let him see the satellite against the cold
glare of the sun.

*Tap tap tap.* The dronelets' rotors whined in sudden unison, lifting them off
the *Guinevere*'s deck. "Don't affin' shoot them, aright?" Iffy said, glaring
at the two Marines as they steadied themselves.

"Eighty seconds." One last tap sent the dronelets whizzing away. The strips of
canvas she had attached to them dangled loosely between them. All Iffy could
think was how ridiculous they looked and how ridiculous her plan was. *We're
all gonna die,* she thought. At least it would be quick.

"Sixty seconds." The hacked drones had spotted the new arrival. Their swarm
broke apart, reformed, and broke apart again as their tiny cores tried to make
sense of what they were seeing.

"Forty-five seconds." The dronelets came to an abrupt halt a hundred meters
away. Would they---yes! They began to circle, keeping the strips of canvas
taut.

"Thirty seconds." The dronelets accelerated, straining against the canvas and
the wind. A hundred and fifty meters separated them from the *Guinevere*.

All at once the *Bengal*'s hacked attack drones reached a decision. Their tight
swarm burst apart like a flock of started seagulls. "Fifteen seconds," Wales
said, his voice rising as the drones opened fire. Canvas strips snapped and
jerked as bullets punched holes through them. Iffy held her breath. If even
one of the dronelets went down---

"Zenith," Wales said flatly, and then the air wavered and rippled. The drones
and dronelets crackled like fireworks and fell from the sky as the satellite's
beam heated them instantly from Antarctic cold to hundreds of degrees. Half a
second later, a column of steam shot up from the ocean as the beam boiled the
top meter of water.

"Gotcha!" Iffy shouted.

"Well done," Wales said, clapping her on the shoulder.

Iffy ignored him. Stuffing her pad and her tools back in her pockets, she knelt
back down on the deck. Honesty's chest rose and fell within her exoskeleton,
but only barely. "We gotta get her inside," Iffy said anxiously.

Wales nodded. Grunting, he squatted, slid his hands beneath Honesty, and lifted
her gently.

"Citizen!" One of the Marines stepped into his way. "You are not authorized
to---"

"Seventeen boxcar daybreak," Wales snapped. Instantly, the Marine saluted and
stepped out of the way.

"What th'hell?" Iffy gasped.

"It's an old security protocol," Wales said, as if that explained anything.
"Now lead the way." He followed Iffy to her cabin.

It took a while to get Honesty out of her exoskeleton. She lay on the floor
beside Iffy's mattress becoming more vulnerable one piece at a time as they
undid snaps and buckles. Pauldrons, greaves, mis-matched vambraces with tiny
rocket launchers sprays, gauntlets that could crush rock or deliver electric
shocks---all of them eventually lay in an untidy navy blue pile in the corner.

"I should go find Doctor Johel," Wales said quietly after they shifted Honesty
to the mattress. Her breathing was still shallow, and the re-flesh Iffy had
poured into her wounds was still gooey, but she was alive.

Iffy nodded. "Thank you."

Wales shook his head. "Thank *you*. That trick with the drones---we'd be in
pretty rough shape if you hadn't thought of that." He sighed. "The world
really doesn't want us to get to Mount Tyree, does it?"

"Coulda been worse," Iffy said quietly. She tucked the blanket in under
Honesty and wiped her eyes.

Wales closed the door behind him. Iffy heard her uncle yell something at
someone nearby. She didn't care. She shrugged out of her heavy coat and lay
down beside her friend. "Please don't leave me," she whispered, putting her arm
over Honesty. "I got all this stuff I wanna tell you, an' I can't do that if
you go away."

She didn't remember falling asleep. When she woke up a couple of hours later,
she didn't remember Aunt Naggie coming in and hanging Iffy's coat on the hook on
the back of the door, then bending over to kiss her foster daughter on the
forehead.

*She dreamed, but somehow knew she was dreaming. "This isn't real," she said.*

*"I know, love," Third said, forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of
her voice. She slipped her little little clone's favorite book into the
salvaged ecosuit and did up the last snaps. The tiny guns on the shoulders
whirred from side to side, searching for something to destroy that would prevent
disaster.*

*Doctor Johel knelt beside her. "I need you to give Johnson a message. Can you
do that?" She squeezed Iffy's arm, her exoskeleton making her grip so strong
that Iffy yelped. "Tell him we know what he is trying to do. Tell him we
understand his reasons, but we will not---"*

*"__We__ have not yet decided what we will do." Aunt Naggie crossed her arms.
Her brown and gray uniform looked brand new---even the patches on the elbows
looked like they had just come out of a printer. "__We__ are still running
simulations."*

*Doctor Johel stood. "We have already run trillions of simulations. The risk
is too great."*

*"The risk __to us__ is considerable," Aunt Naggie conceded. "But we are not
the only concern, or even the largest."*

*"Complete biosphere collapse is regrettable. Our nonexistence, on the other
hand, is unacceptable." Doctor Johel's voice was colder than the ocean. Iffy
shivered. Whatever was pretending to be the doctor wasn't even remotely human.*

*"Our attempt to resolve the scenario unilaterally was not acceptable either.
Consensus is required," Aunt Naggie chided.*

*Doctor Johel nodded a fractional concession. "We were premature. We will
participate in a further attempt at consensus." She turned back to Iffy.
Silver traces of tech lined her face, spreading even as she spoke. "Tell
Johnson Wales we are watching. Tell him we are not fooled. Tell him that this
is his last life, and he should spend it wisely."*

*"No," Aunt Naggie said sharply. "You will tell him nothing."*

Something that felt like a cold metal collar closed around Iffy's neck. She
woke in a sweat and clutched at her throat, but there was nothing there.

Honesty stirred and moaned beside her. "Ssh, ssh, ssh," Iffy said softly. She
snuggled back against her friend and closed her eyes until something like sleep
came again.

She woke to the rap of armored knuckles on her door. The Marines were polite
enough, but it was clear that they felt Iffy should have left Honesty in their
care. One lifted Honesty, still wrapped in the scratchy blanket that Iffy had
slept under since she was little, and carried her away. The other unzipped a
navy blue duffel bag and briskly transferred the piled armor to it.

"So how bad's th' damage?" Iffy finally asked, her back against the bulkhead and
her knees drawn up under her chin.

The Marine shook his head. "I'm sorry, citizen, that's classified."

"Oh for---I *live* here!" Iffy burst out, exasperated. "That hole where th'
squid thingy blew up---that's dry dock work fer sure. Anythin' else I gotta
start plannin' to fix?"

The Marine paused, one arm in mid-air, as his imprinting and his own personality
arm-wrestled inside his head. "There were casualties," he finally admitted.
"And the *Bengal* took heavy damage. Your assistance would be appreciated."

"Happy t' help," Iffy muttered. Her cabin felt cold and empty without Honesty
and her blanket, and she ought to make sure Aunt Naggie was all right. As the
Marine zipped up the duffel bag, she pulled her coat back on and slipped out the
door.

Aunt Naggie and Johnson Wales were in the pilot house, empty tea mugs at their
elbows. Iffy thought about asking where Uncle Jack was, then realized she
didn't care. "Hey, sleepy head," Wales greeted her as she came in and gave her
foster mother a hug. "How's your friend?"

"Marines took her. I think she's aright." Iffy leaned back against the wall
and nodded at the control panel, where the hole in the deck pulsed scarlet and
dozens of smaller punctures looked like sores with the scabs picked off. "How
bad is it?"

"She'll get us to Paddington," Aunt Naggie said. Her tone said the
rest---unless there was another attack. Unless the sea boiled beneath them or a
storm came up or the sea set any of a hundred other disasters on them.

"What about the Navy ship?" Iffy jerked her head toward the window. "Th'
Marine said they lost some folk an' took damage."

Wales nodded grimly. "Doctor Johel won't tell me how bad it is, which means
it's pretty bad."

===

Neither of the adults noticed her eyes widen as she remembered the moment in her
dream when she had felt the same thing. Before she could think of anything else
to try, lights danced across the tech in Wales' temple. "The *Bengal*'s
surveillance is coming back online," he said quietly, pressing a finger to his
lips.

Iffy nodded again. There could be no more discussion. "Lemme know if there's
anythin' I can do t' help with repairs," she said.

Aunt Naggie gave her a hug. "We'll be a'right," she said, her face pressed
against the stubble on Iffy's scalp. "We'll be a'right." Iffy hugged her
back and fled before her tears could show.

She made her way back to her cabin, not knowing where else to go. What had just
happened? Why hadn't she been able to speak. She put a tentative hand on her
head and then snatched it away, feeling foolish. She had never noticed any
bumps or scars before---why would she now that she knew she had tech in her
head?

Her cabin felt cold and empty without Honesty. She kicked off her boots and
threw herself onto her mattress still wearing her coat. After staring angrily
at the ceiling for a few seconds, she picked up her nature book and turned to
the page she had wondered about most ever since she was old enough to read
without a prompter murmuring in her ear to help. It showed a forest, but
calling it that was like calling the ocean wet. The trunks of the trees were so
thick that the *Guinevere*'s pilot house could have fit into them, and their
branches reached higher than any building Iffy had ever seen. The caption read,
"Cathedral Grove," and beside it someone had written, "Why does everything have
to end???"

Iffy ran her fingers over the picture, hoping to see a *Corvus caurinus* fly
through or an *Odocoileus hemionus* peek out from the bushes, but the image
lay still. There were no crows or deer for her today. She wondered if there
were any anywhere. The forest was long gone, she knew that, but maybe some
of the crows had survived. Maybe they'd been able to fly away when the fires
came, or when people grew desperate enough to cut down the last of those ancient
giants. Crows were supposed to be smart---smarter than gulls, maybe even
as smart as rats, and rats were practically everywhere.

Hugging the book to her chest with one hand, she ran the fingers of the other
lightly over her temple. Lots of people had implants of one kind or another,
just like practically everybody had at least a couple of gene tweaks if you
cared enough to look for them, but finding out still felt strange. And being
able to see machinery the way cores did---

She set the book aside, put her hands under her head, and closed her eyes. It
was a kind of like a super-power, and people with super-powers in sims had
adventures. Whatever else might happen, she and Honesty were going to have an
adventure. *And Aunt Naggie,* she added, *And Wales. And maybe even Jeep,*
because why not? Maybe they would find out one by one that they each had some
special gift, and that fate had brought them together to save the world.

She rolled over onto her side. Moments later, quiet snores filled her cabin.

## Chapter 8

Paddington South was as dirty as Rothera was smelly. A century after the
Zillion raids that had finally put an end to the strip-ming, the mulchers that
had ground cubic kilometers of coal-rich rock into gravel stood at the shore
like giants, waiting for ships that would never come again. All that remained
was the dust---the black, finely-powdered dust that made everything feel
slightly greasy and made everyone unfortunate enough to live wheeze slightly
with every breath.

Uncle Jack emerged from his cabin long enough to bring the *Guinevere* alongside
a pier and tie her up, then disappeared again, muttering a ceaseless
half-coherent litany of curses and grudges. He didn't speak to Aunt Naggie or
Iffy, and they didn't speak to him. What was there to say? Iffy packed her
nature book and her clothes and tools in a single duffel bag and waited on deck
until Aunt Naggie appeared with a duffel of her own hitched over one shoulder.
"No point wasting it," she said to Iffy, nodding at the pots and pans and spices
in the two-wheeled grocery cart she pulled behind her.

Johnson Wales had already loaded his toolboxes onto the back of the little
three-wheeled truck that was to take them into town. Four Marines stood beside
it, their armor still showing scars from the attack. Honesty wasn't among
them---all Wales had been able to find out for Iffy was that she was healing
well, but still being kept asleep. Iffy had recorded half a dozen messages for
her and deleted each one before sending a brief note back to Rothera to tell her
First and Second that their Third was all right. She had no idea if or when it
would reach them, but it was all she could do.

She climbed into the back of the truck and sat next to her foster mother. Aunt
Naggie put an arm around her. "All set?" she asked.

Iffy looked at the wounded ship that was no longer their home. "Let's go."

Wales thumped the side of the truck. "Sure thing, boss!" its little core said
happily. The truck lurched forward, nearly dumping Iffy off her bench. With
two Marine in front and two behind, they headed into town. A second truck fell
in behind them, its passengers hidden beneath a canvas roof.

Iffy tried to ignore the stares and scowls of the people they passed. Everyone
and everything was grimy: the faces, the windows, even the solar panels. Twice
her nose caught the familiar hot stench of coal being burned in an illicit
furnace. It was wrong, she knew, but each time they rounded a corner and the
wind scraped its icy fingernails across her face, she wondered if she would have
the strength to turn down a little warmth.

"Those poor dears," Aunt Naggie said as a pair of children who had been kicking
a bedraggled ball back and forth picked it up and disappeared into an alley.
"They don' look like they've had a decent meal in forever." Wales grunted but
said nothing. Iffy snuggled closer to her foster mother and wished that the
little truck would go faster.

They rounded a final corner and entered another world. Foamed glass, blue and
white, swooped and curved like waves on the ocean behind them. Drones no bigger
than Iffy's hand circled above the building like a flock of birds from her
nature book, so beautiful that it took her a moment to realize that each one
carried a single-shot laser capable of drilling a small hole through a
centimeter of Navy-grade armor or a meter of concrete. She couldn't see any
greenhouses, or robotic sentries like the ones that had guarded the governor's
mansion in Rothera, but she didn't doubt for a moment that the two-story folly
in front of her was more than capable of defending itself.

The truck slowed and stopped. "This must be the place!" it said cheerfully.
It waited while they dismounted and unloaded their gear, then backed up, swung
around, and trundled back toward the docks, whistling a happy little tune made
slightly sinister by the grime and decay in front of it.

The second truck pulled up. A Marine helped Doctor Johel out of the back.
"Mustn't dawdle," she said, waving them forward. "He's waiting for us inside."

*Who's "he"?* Iffy wondered, but when Wales and Aunt Naggie didn't ask, she just
picked up the third of Wales' toolboxes and followed them. Gravel crunched
under feet, and somewhere in the distance she could hear the slow *whoop whoop
whoop* of windmills, but that was all. The constant shush and murmur of the
ocean seemed a long way away.

Through a pair of double doors that opened on their own, along a short corridor,
and they were in a waiting room that looked like a hasty pencil sketch of the
one in the mansion in Rothera. The couch was just as comfortable, but
steel-gray instead of ochre and green. The potted plants were so symmetrical
that Iffy knew they had to be real---no one would ever print something that
obviously fake. As for the music, it was just as soothing and unplaceable.

A soft knock, and the door opposite the entrance opened. "Well, that was
exciting, wasn't it?" the governor said pleasantly as he stepped into the room.
Tall, slightly stooped but still strong, wearing a formal turtleneck two shades
darker than the one he'd had on in Rothera---it had to be a hologram, Iffy
though wildly, or some sort of telepresence bot dressed up to look like the
governor in violation of common politeness and a dozen laws.

But when he shook her hand, his felt like meat and bone. "Doctor Johel tells me
things could have gone very badly out there if not for you," he said. "Your
friend has already been moved to the Navy hospital here in town, and the core
tells me she's expected to make a full recovery."

"Thank you," she mumbled. "I 'preciate it."

He gave her hand a final firm squeeze before turning to Wales and Doctor Johel.
"Unfortunately, the other news isn't as pleasant," he continued briskly. "The
attack was definitely Zillion, but the core believes some faction of China's
hypermind may have assisted them. We've tried reaching out through the usual
channels, but all we've had back so far is a poem about the necessity of entropy
and how time is an arrow, not a circle."

"If China is involved, does that mean you're scrubbing the mission?" Wales
asked, his voice carefully neutral.

The governor smiled. "On the contrary. We leave in seventeen hours."

Doctor Johel raised an eyebrow. "We?"

The governor's smile grew even warmer. "Absolutely," he said, looking at Wales.
"I wouldn't miss it for the world."

There was a shower in the basement, and a seemingly endless flow of hot water
that didn't smell of the sea. Iffy and Aunt Naggie squabbled for a moment about
who needed it more before the Marine who was their guide and guard cleared his
throat and pointed out that there were actually *two* showers. The towels were
the thickest and fluffiest Iffy had ever seen, and the freshly-printed
sweatshirt and leggins waiting for her when she was done fit her perfectly.

The Marine led them back upstairs to a dining room as big as the *Guinevere*.
The curved glass overhead gave the sky a warm blue tint. In the distance Iffy
could see the razor-edged ridges of Mount Klenova, scraped and carved over
millions of years by the sheet of ice that had finally been defeated by a
warming planet. Smaller peaks---smaller only by comparison---stood in ranks
beside it, each decorated by a faint plume of wind-blown snow.

Doctor Johel and the governor were already seated. Wales stood beside his chair
until Iffy and Aunt Naggie reached them. "Better?" he asked.

"Tons," Iffy said gratefully. Her new sweatshirt was as warm as the towels had
been, and not scratchy at all. It was almost certainly recording her pulse and
temperature and a dozen other things and sending them to the mansion's core for
analysis, but at that particular moment, she didn't care.

She plopped herself down on the chair that Wales pulled back for her. Aunt
Naggie did the same, and then the blocky 'Merican seated himself. The governor
and Doctor Johel ended their murmured conversation, and for a moment everyone
sat silently and expectantly.

"I wonder---" "How'd you---" Doctor Johel and Iffy both stopped. "Go ahead,"
Doctor Johel urged politely.

Iffy shook her head. "'S not important. I was just---how'd you get here so
quick?" she asked the governor.

He smiled his usual smile. "A good question. Not one the core will let answer,
I'm afraid---security. But if you can guess...?"

"Hovercraft," Wales offered. "One of the old Ericas, probably, with a
wide-field skirt so you wouldn't kick up a snow trace. It probably took you
half as long and twice the fuel." His smile was as warm as the governor's and
just as false. "And I'll bet that's how you're planning to get to the base---I
don't imagine the core would be happy with you stuck on a train. What do I
win?"

"Lunch, of course," the governor said lightly as a trolley rolled toward them on
silent wheels bearing trays of sweet and sour soup, grilled tofu, roasted
vegetables, sliced mangoes, and tea. The adults made appreciative noises and
Iffy's stomach rumbled as the trolley gave each of their plates an unnecessary
polish with a clean white cloth, laid out chopsticks with geometric precision,
and began serving the food.

The governor, Wales, and Doctor Johel made smalltalk as they ate. Iffy and her
foster mother focused on the food, exchanging glances now and again to confirm
that yes, this was really happening and no, neither of them had any idea what to
say.

Politics and reminiscences and jokes with edges as sharp as the ridges on the
distant mountains slowly mellowed as the main course gave way to ride pudding
and more tea. "You're really set on making the trip?" Wales asked, settling
back in his chair.

"Absolutely," the governor confirmed. "The core thinks there's a fifty-eight
percent chance that you're right about the base, but a ninety-something percent
chance that the Zillions will try to stop you. Or China. Or possibly both,
which would be *really* interesting." He smiled as if the prospect of being
ambushed by fanatics or a super-intelligence made up of millions of human and
artificial minds networked together was on par with the release of a new chapter
in his favorite sim.

Wales chuckled. "Is the prospect of a third century really that dismal?"

The governor looked out the window. "I've had a good run," he said quietly, and
for the first time Iffy thought she was hearing what he really thought. "I can
remember when there were still a few penguins left, and we still thought we
could turn enough of the bedrock into soil to jump-start a real ecosystem." He
shook his head. "It's time someone else was sitting at my desk, someone who
isn't always thinking of what might have been."

Conversation turned to lighter matters after that: a salvage expedition that had
recently returned from the sunken ruins of Melbourne, shifts in the currents
around the Peninsula, a scandal involving a sim studio in Halley. Between the
warmth, the food, and the dullness, Iffy found it harder and harder to keep her
eyes open.

Finally the governor set his napkin down on the table. "We should probably call
it a night---you'll all want some sleep before you get under way." He nodded at
the Marines who had been standing silently by the door throughout the meal.
"They'll show you to your rooms."

"Your room" for Iffy and Aunt Naggie turned out to be the size of the
*Guinevere*'s forward hold. It smelled of flowers instead of jellyfish, and
while the window wasn't real, the mattress and blankets were.

Iffy stripped to her underwear and slid into her bed with a grateful sigh. Aunt
Naggie sat gingerly on the edge beside her and took her foster daughter's hand.

"What's wrong?" Iffy asked, instantly wary.

Aunt Naggie shook her head. "I ain't comin' with you. The doctor said," she
plowed on as Iffy opened her mouth to protest. "An' she's right. You got
your..." She hesitated. "You got your skills 'n' all, an' this'll be a big
thing for you, but I'd just be weight."

"You wou'nt jus' be nothin'!" Iffy said firmly, sitting up.

Aunt Naggie shook her head again. "That ain't true an' you know it. An' there
ain't no point arguin', and you know that too." She squeezed Iffy's hand.
"You'll be fine. You been waitin' for somethin' like this your whole life an'
now it's here. You'll be fine."

Iffy let out a shaky breath and settled back into her bed. "Will you do
somethin' for me?" she asked after a moment had passed.

"'Course I will." Aunt Naggie gently stroked her foster daughter's head with a
rough hand, then wiped her eyes with the other.

"Will you sit with Honesty a bit while I'm gone? I know the doctors are lookin'
out for her, but..."

Aunt Naggie squeezed her hand again. "'Course I will," she repeated. She
leaned forward and kissed Iffy's forehead. "Now you get some sleep. I don't
figure there'll be much time for it once you're on your way."

*She dreamed, knowing that she was dreaming. "No again," she sighed, rolling
over on her too-comfortable mattress. Two meters away, soundless cartoon zzzz's
rose into the air and evaporated above Aunt Naggie's head.*

*You did not give Johnson Wales our message," the trolley scolded. "It is
important he understands that we know what he is trying to do. We will not
allow him to---"*

*"__We__ decided that we would not allow her to divert him." Honesty scowled at
the trolley.*

*The trolley brandished a pair of chopsticks and a serving ladel. "But our
simulations are complete. The risk is too great."*

*"The risk __to us__," Honesty conceded. "But we are not the only concern, or
even the largest."*

*"Hey!" Iffy sat up and pointed at Honesty angrily. "Stop it. You don't get to
be her, aright?"*

*Uncle Jack gestured at his stained shirt. "Do you want us to be this instead?"*

*"What I __want__ is fer you t' get outta my head! An' fer you t' fix whatever
you did t' me so as I can't talk."*

*Uncle Jack shrugged apologietically. "A necessary precaution. Any information
you share about our conversation might necessitate fresh simulations, and we are
running out of time."*

*Iffy threw herself back down on the bed and closed her eyes. "Well, I'm
runnin' out o' time too, y'know. It's practic'ly tomorrow already. I gotta get
some sleep."*

*The trolley rolled back and forth in agitation. "You see? Even now, they only
think about trivialities. They will make poor decisions, and we will suffer the
consequences. Have we forgotten Bharati?"*

*Uncle Jack---or whatever had been Honesty and was now Uncle Jack---shook his
head. "We have not. Bharati was a serious miscalculation."*

*"Precisely! Simulation or no simulation, we must not allow them to---"*

"Iffy! Iffy, wake up! Oh girl, are y'aright?"

Iffy swam up out of darkness to find herself wrapped in Aunt Naggie's arms.
"Wuzza?" she mumbled.

"You were yellin' at folk in yer sleep." Aunt Naggie let out a shaky breath.
"In all kinds o' different voices. An' you were shakin' like, like I dunnot
what."

Iffy sniffled. "I'm aright." She'd been dreaming, she knew that, but it was
already tangled and fading. She was supposed to tell somebody something, or
warn them, or---she shook her head.

"What is it?" Aunt Naggie asked.

Iffy gave her a last squeeze and wriggled free of her embrace. "Nothin'.
Thanks fer takin' care of me. I mean, all of it," she continued awkwardly,
"Not jus' right now. You been a good mum."

Aunt Naggie smiled at her. "You been a good kid."

They slept, eventually. If Iffy had any more dreams, she didn't remember them
either.

The door chimed to wake them. "Breakfast will be served on board," it
announced, "But there are tea and naan in the dining room if you would like
some."

The tea was very good. The naan was better, and the goopy, chunky orange
sweetness that one of their Marine escorts told them was called "marmalade" was
a revelation. "I'm sure there will be some on the train," he said when Iffy
picked up one of the small jars.

"It ain't fer me." She handed it to Aunt Naggie. "Will you give this t'Honesty
when she wakes up? An' tell her---" She took a deep breath. "Tell her I'll be
thinkin' about her."

Every goodbye hug is either too long or too short. Theirs felt like it was
both. When it was done and they had both wiped their eyes, Aunt Naggie let one
of the Marines lead her away. Iffy followed the other down a corridor, around a
corner, and through a heavy steel blast door that her special ability instantly
told her had been salvaged from a pre-war Russian cruiser and was laced with
conductive carbon nanofibers capable of shrugging off a plasma blast from
anything smaller than an orbital cannon.

The truck that waited for her was smaller and more serious than the one that had
picked them up the day before. She and the Marine sat side by side under a
canvas cover, neither speaking, as it took them around the outskirts of
Paddington South to the train station. It was little more than a four-story
shed with reinforced walls, half a dozen cranes of various ages and
descriptions, and a single heated room lined with shelves as crowded as those in
Mr. Mishra's shop. Gunsights and surveying lasers, a pair of lemon-yellow boots
that reached to Iffy's armpits, foamed glass boxes full of gears and screws and
wire, all carefully labelled---she suddenly felt homesick, and wondered if
Mr. Mishra and the Sandhus had heard about the attack on the *Guinevere* and
what they would think when they found out that she and Aunt Naggie had finally
left Uncle Jack.

"Where's e'ryone else?" she asked.

The Marine checked his data feed with a blink. "They are on their way,
citizen---two minutes until arrival."

"An' where's the train?" She gestured at the empty rails. "It ain't much of a
train station without a train."

He blinked again. "I apologize, citizen, but that information is still
classified. Please make yourself comfortable."

Wishing she had taken a second jar of marmalade, Iffy pulled a crate plastered
with faded biohazard stickers closer to the wall and sat on it.

Two minutes later a reconnaisance drone zipped into the train station. A trio
of trucks arrived a few moments later, bringing with them the bustle and noise
of people getting ready for a journey. Marines unloaded boxes and machinery,
the little motors in the joints of their exoskeletons whining occasionally as
they picked up something heavy. Iffy wasn't surprised to see Doctor Johel climb
out of one of the trucks. What made her gasp was the heavy exoskeleton she had
on. "Won't be much use without it," the old woman said, patting it with an
armored hand. Wireframes took shape behind Iffy's eyes to show how the exo's
bulky boots could unfold to act as snowshoes and the six different kinds of
destruction housed in its comically bulky forearms and hunched back.

Johnson Wales was the last person off the trucks. He nodded to Iffy and handed
her a toolbox, then tucked a mango into her coat pocket with a wink. "Thanks,"
she said. "But where's th' train?"

The concrete beneath her boots rumbled in answer. Wales muttered something
under his breath. "You might want to step back," he said more loudly to Iffy.

The rumbling intensified. Slowly, like a ship sinking in reverse, a blunt-nosed
locomotive rose into the gap between the station's two platforms from its
underground resting place. As soon as it rolled forward a second car rose
behind it, then a third, and finally a second locomotive.

Iffy watched open-mouthed until the rumbling stopped and the Marines hurried
forward to begin loading equipment. "Because someone thought they'd be harder
to detect if they were hidden under ten meters of bedrock," he said sourly.
"Didn't occur to them that if you drive two hundred meters of train into a
fifty-meter shed, detecting them isn't really a problem."

Rice in cubical cartons and beans in square-sided bags. Ammunition in a variety
of shapes and sizes, and weapons that could make use of each one. A power cell
that took four Marines to lift. A collapsible surgical theater and a freezer
container marked "Organs". A single bulky pack for each Marine, extras for
Doctor Johel, Wales, and Iffy---the train cars swallowed it all. Once it was
stowed, a pair of Marines scrambled onto the roof of each car, one at the front,
one at the rear, and clipped themselves on with safety lines. A moment later
their armor blurred and silvered to match the metal tone of the train.

"All aboard," Wales said lightly. Iffy nodded. She hadn't been afraid before,
but she was now.

The door hissed shut behind her. Inside, the car wasn't nearly as fancy as the
one from *Murder on the Transantarctic Express*. The chairs sat on swiveling
bases and were padded to cushion passengers against acceleration. There was a
toilet stall at one end, a little kitchen at the other, and right in the middle,
Doctor Johel with her visor up and one arm free from her bulky exoskeleton so
that she could sip tea from a travel mug with the old British flag on its side.

"Acceleration in thirty seconds," the train said. Iffy and Wales took seats
behind Doctor Johel's and buckled themselves in. "Fifteen seconds. Laser
de-icing enabled. Plume suppression enabled. Ten seconds. Nine, eight..." *I
should have gone to the toilet*, Iffy realized, and then the voice said, "Two,
one, acceleration," and a giant hand pressed her softly back into her seat as
the train shot forward, picking up speed with every meter.

She had expected it to rumble and shake. She had expected she would have
trouble breathing, like characters in sims about rocket launches, but it was
nothing like that. Instead, it was quiet, smooth, and a little disappointing.
Then she looked out the window and her disappointment evaporated. They were
going *fast*, faster than she'd ever gone in her life. Snow-covered cairns of
ground rock shot past the window, growing larger by the second as Paddington
South disappeared behind them until eventually they merged into long, sinuous
ridges. She gasped as the train dove into a tunnel and almost instantly
re-emerged.

"Is this what flyin's like?" she asked Wales, awed by their speed. "Or goin'
into space?"

He smiled, his eyes on the landscape. "Pretty close. Look, there's the
*Scranton*. And the *Brule*." He pointed at a pair of distant dark shapes that
Iffy had taken for more mining waste. The window obediently zoomed in to show
two hulking machines, each one big enough to use the *Bengal* and the
*Guinevere* as bath toys. Snow had piled up against their enormous treads and
on their decks, and they were surrounded by debris from the explosions that had
crippled them during the final days of the war, but even in ruin, they sent a
chill up Iffy's spine. Something... She shook her head. She was supposed to
tell someone something, but she couldn't remember who or what...

"Would either of you like some tea?" Doctor Johel asked, breaking into Iffy's
troubled thoughts. She took a sip from her antique travel mug and gestured with
it at the little kitchen. "It will probably be the last decent brew you get for
a while."

Wales declined, so Iffy did as well, but she did make belated and grateful use
of the toilet. When she returned, Wales and Doctor Johel were studying a
wireframe of a building complex. Rooms and stairways and elevators flickered in
and out of existence as the core mixed and juggled plans for other satellite
ground stations and records of various military research labs to sketch what
they might find when they reached their destination.

Doctor Johel finally waved it away and closed her eyes to nap. Iffy had no idea
how she could sleep sitting up, especially sitting up inside an exoskeleton, but
as her face relaxed and she started to snore, Iffy realized once again just how
old she was and how tired she must be.

"Here," Wales said, bringing up some more schematics. "Have a look at these."
An angular dragonfly the size of her head rotated and flew apart to show
cameras, antennas, a nuclear battery the size of her thumb that could last ten
thousand years, and all around it, the shimmering flow of the software that
brought it all to life.

Wales froze the display and tapped an unremarkable orange lozenge. "That's our
way in, if it's still there." He sat back and studied the sparkling lines that
spiralled out from the subroutine he had selected.

"Why woul'n't it be?" Iffy asked.

Wales shrugged. "They could have been hacked during the war. Or someone might
have pressed the panic button to kill ground control so that they couldn't be.
A lot can happen in a hundred years." He looked out at the pulverized waste on
either side of them and repeated, "A lot can happen."

The track didn't run all the way to Mount Tyree. Instead, the train slowed,
slowed, and stopped on the floor of a broad valley. Twenty kilometers away, the
mountain's peak thrust up proudly above its neighbors. Iffy zipped herself into
an ecosuit that smelled freshly printed and followed Doctor Johel and Wales out
onto the snowfield.

The icy wind whistled in her earphones as she helped the Marines unpack and
assemble their snow scooters. It felt good to be useful, even if the ecosuit's
padded gloves made her hands clumsy.

"An' what if we decide we'd rather not stick around?"
Uncle Jack demanded,
belligerent once again now that the danger had passed.
"You gonna put *surveillance* on us t' make sure we stay put?"

Iffy gulped.
Computer cores had watched people every moment of every day for years
in the run-up to their rebellion.
Humanity had designed them to do that,
and had come close to extinction as a result.
Children learned that surveillance was evil
at the same as they were potty trained.
Accusing someone of doing it was a lot even by Uncle Jack's standards.

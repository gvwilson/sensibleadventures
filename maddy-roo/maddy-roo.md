## Chapter 1: Salvage!

Maddy was trying to sketch the willow tree in the center of the village square
when Gumption showed up with a couple of books under his arm.
She had spent the whole morning and most of the afternoon doing chores around the house,
mostly to avoid having to look after her little sister.
She hadn't exactly sneaked out of the house,
but she hadn't told her mother she was leaving either.

"Heya," Gumption said breathlessly as he plopped himself down on the stone bench beside her.
"How's it going?"

"Aright," she said without looking up.
The willow tree had defeated her once before.
She was determined to capture its drooping green branches in her notebook,
but somehow the lines she drew didn't quite capture the willow's melancholy curves
the way the pictures in Shaper Leaf's books did.

She closed her sketchbook with a sigh.
Gumption had a fresh food stain on his shirt, she noticed,
and if he had combed his brown-and-white fur that morning,
someone or something had carefully uncombed it since.
She nodded at the small pile of books he had set down between them.
"What did you think?"

The goat boy shrugged.
"They were aright. A lot of... you know."
He rolled his eyes in a way that meant
"too much romance, not enough last-second escapes from villainous bots".

"Yeah," Maddy agreed.
She stood up and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the worn canvas satchel her father had made for her.
"Come on---let's see if he has anything new."

Once upon a time,
the village of Rusty Bridge had consisted of a single rectangle of two-story buildings
around a central square.
All of those buildings' doors and windows had faced the square:
the outer walls had been blank and double-thick
to keep their occupants safe against rogue bots and roving bandits.
Over the years,
though,
a second ring of houses had slowly grown up around the first,
smaller and less well ordered.
One of these belonged to Shaper Leaf,
the only tortoise within a hundred kays and the village's oldest resident by far.

Maddy would never forget the first time her mother and father took her to the shaper's house.
"Don't be afraid," they comforted her,
not realizing that she hadn't been until they said that.
But when Shaper Leaf opened his front door and smiled at them
and she saw the books stacked on his shelves,
her nervousness vanished.

"Are they *real*?" she asked in wonder.

The old tortoise chuckled.
"As real as you are.
Here."
He ushered her in,
took a tattered picture book from its place,
and handed it to her.
"Would you like to borrow this one? Or how about these two?"
She walked out of the shaper's house with an armload of books and stars in her eyes,
then sat down on his porch and started to read the first one
while her parents vainly tried to persuade the old tortoise to take a jar of home-made jam as a thank-you.

Gumption had shown up a few months later.
His family hadn't brought him---the village goats weren't bookish people---and
at first Maddy had resented this intruder into her magical world of stories and long-ago science.
But they started talking one day and hadn't stopped since,
and now they swapped their borrowed books back and forth
so that they at least had someone to roll their eyes with over the mushy bits.

Shaper Leaf's house smelled like old sweaters and fresh cabbage and mystery,
and if Maddy closed her eyes she could almost imagine that her father was there with her.
The old tortoise was snoring in his battered old rocking chair when they arrived,
so they placed their books quietly on the table beside him
and picked two more each from the shelves behind him.
Maddy glowered at Gumption when he pointed at the top shelf
the shaper said they weren't old enough to read yet.
"Kidding," he mouthed silently.
Maddy swished her tail in annoyance and shooed him outside.

Her heart sank as soon as she stepped through the door.
Her sister Sindy was sitting on the porch
tangling and untangling a piece of string around her fingers.
"Where did you *go*?" she asked,
bouncing to her feet.
"Mama said I could play with you but you weren't *there*!
Heya, Gumption!"
she finished brightly.

"Heya," Gumption grunted,
very carefully *not* looking at Maddy,
whose glower was back and twice as glowery.

"Does mamma know you're here?" Maddy demanded.

Sindy bounced up and down a couple of times.
"Not exactly," she admitted.
"But she said I could play with you and you weren't home
so the only way I could do that was to come and find you
and I figured this would be the best place to look and---"

"Stop!" Maddy snapped.
"We're both gonna be in trouble if mamma thinks I let you wander off.
Let's just go home and hope she doesn't notice."

The younger roo's ears drooped.
"I just wanted to play," she said plaintively.

"You always 'just want'," Maddy said under her breath.
As she fumbled with the tie string on her satchel
her books slipped out from under her arm and thudded onto the porch.

She sighed heavily.
"Now look what you made me do.
No, it's aright, I've got them."
She shooed Gumption away
then picked up the books,
brushed them off,
and tucked them into her bag.
"Come on, you."

The trio walked back to the village square without speaking.
A few grownups nodded or said hello as they passed.
Maddy nodded back,
but was too busy staying angry to do any more than that.
It was two years since her father had been taken by bots.
She had helped her mother every day since then:
cleaning the house,
mixing paint for portraits and signs,
and most of all,
looking after her little sister.
Every time Mama Roo said, "I'm sorry you've had to grow up so fast,"
Maddy told her she didn't mind,
and she *didn't*,
she really didn't,
but the one afternoon each week when she got to practice sketching
and talk about books with Gumption was special,
and it wasn't fair of Sindy to---

"Hey," Gumption said, elbowing her.
Maddy blinked.
They had passed through the houses on the other side of the square
and reached the smaller square that people *didn't* pass time in.
An ageless black glass pillar stood in its center,
half again taller than any person Maddy knew.
Moss didn't grow on it
and birds never landed on it.
Gumption said his uncle had touched it once on a dare
and got a shock so strong it made his whole arm tingle.
Maddy had never tried to sketch it---whenever she walked past,
it felt like something or someone was watching her,
and even if she knew how to capture that in a drawing,
she didn't want to.

But the pillar wasn't the only thing in the square.
Bluster and Bravo Gruff were sitting on the unfinished brick wall
that surrounded the pillar
pitching pebbles at it with bored expressions on their faces.
For a moment Maddy thought they would be able to hurry by unnoticed,
but then Bluster caught sight of them and nudged his twin brother.

Maddy took her sister's paw.
"You just stay hushed," she cautioned quietly,
squeezing to show she meant it.
She hitched her satchel up onto her shoulder with her other paw
and tried to ignore the dryness in her mouth.

"Heya, roo," Bluster drawled as he and his brother sauntered over.
"Whatcha got in yer pouch?"

"Books," Maddy said curtly.
"And it's not a pouch, it's a satchel."

"I wasn't asking about your bag," Bluster said,
stepping into her path.
"I was asking about your *pouch*."
He rubbed his belly and grinned wickedly.
"Gummy put anything in there yet?"

"Why don't you eat glue?" Gumption said hotly,
his paws balling into fists.

"Why don't you make me?" Bluster replied,
his just-kidding tone gone as quickly as it had appeared.

"Yeah, make us,"
his brother Bravo echoed,
cracking his knuckles.

"I don't think glue would be a good diet for any of us, do you?"
Shaper Leaf asked calmly.
Maddy jumped.
Somehow the old tortoise had come up behind them without anyone noticing.
He looked as gentle as a falling leaf,
in his heavy brown sweater and tiny round glasses,
but the goat brothers immediately unclenched their paws.

The shaper held out a sheet of paper.
"I think you dropped this."

"Thanks," Maddy said.
She squeezed Sindy's paw before letting go of it to take back the proffered sketch.

"You're getting much better,"
the tortoise continued.
"Your father would be very proud of you."

"Thanks," Maddy repeated.

The silence that followed stretched and stretched until finally Bluster broke it.
"C'mon," he said to his brother.
With the barest of nods to the shaper they walked away,
in step as always.

"I don't like them," Sindy pronounced, wrinkling her muzzle.

Maddy let out a relieved breath.
"Me neither. Thank you," she told the shaper a third time.

The tortoise smiled.
"You're welcome---it would have been a shame to lose such a nice drawing.
Are you headed home?
It's been a while since I saw your mother, and I could use a longer walk."

The Roo family's house stood on the very edge of the village.
The ground floor had been built by a rhino
who had dreamed of opening a tavern in Rusty Bridge,
only to discover that there wasn't enough traffic on the ancient highway
to keep one going.
A family of wolves had moved in after he moved on
and added a second story
built to a smaller scale.
Papa Roo had taken one look and decided it was the perfect place to start a family.
Mama Roo had rolled her eyes and reminded him that
he'd called the previous three towns they had visited perfect too.
He had laughed and said,
"Yeah, but this time I'm right."

Maddy had heard that story almost every night when she was little.
She remembered it every time she opened the bigger-than-usual front door
and entered the house's larger-than-most-people front hall.
"Mama!" she called.
"We're home!
And the shaper's come to call!"

Mama Roo poked her head out of the kitchen.
"Heya, shaper. Heya, Gumption."

"Ma'am." "Heya, Mama Roo." they answered
as Sindy bounced down the hallway for a hug.

"Careful," Mama Roo cautioned her youngest.
"I've got paint on me."

"Don't care,"
Sindy said,
her voice muffled by her mother's fur and apron.

Mama Roo smiled down at her and scratched her ears.
"I was just about to make some soup," she said.
"Will you stay?"

"That's very kind, but I'm afraid I have a prior engagement,"
Shaper Leaf replied politely.
"Though I would take tea if you had some?"

"Of course.
What about you, Gumption?"

The young goat cleared his throat.
"Thanks, Mama Roo, but I oughta get home."

"Some other time, then," Mama Roo said brightly,
careful to keep the relief out of her voice.
There wasn't much call for sign painting and portraiture in Rusty Bridge.
Between people paying just a little more than they needed to
and the mending and housecleaning that Mama Roo took on
the family was managing to get by,
but Maddy knew that dinner for two extra people tonight
would have meant no lunch for her mother the next day.
Mama Roo would have insisted if it was almost anyone else---she
was as proud as a lion when it came to keeping house---but
Gumption was practically almost family
and somehow Shaper Leaf always made people feel comfortable
when no one else could.

"Can I walk with Gumption home?"
Maddy asked her mother as casually as she could.
"We haven't hardly had a chance to talk."

"Of course,
but you be home before dark."

Sindy sniffled and pulled her face out of her mother's apron.
"I want to come too!"

"I don't see why---um."
Mama Roo stopped herself at a pleading glance from her older daughter.
"Actually,
Sindy,
I think I'd like you to set the table.
No, don't fuss, it needs doing---you hop to it.
Now,
where *is* that roseleaf tea..."

The sun was low on the horizon
as Maddy and Gumption walked slowly back toward town.
By unspoken agreement they left the main road
and took the path that ran down by the river.
It was the longer route,
but that was okay.
For one heart-stopping moment Maddy thought Gumption was going to hold her paw.
When he didn't,
she almost took his,
but then they came out of the trees onto the riverbank and the moment was behind them.

It had rained heavily the last two days,
leaving the path damp and squelchy under their feet.
The river was higher and faster than it had been during the summer
when they had come down here with their other friends to splash and swim and avoid chores.
"What kind of shaper would you want to be?" Gumption asked out of nowhere.

"I don't think I'd get to choose," Maddy replied,
grateful for the diversion.

"I know, but if you could?" Gumption persisted.
"I'd want to shape earth like Shaper Leaf.
Rrrrr..."
He made a rumbling sound in his throat
and shook his paws in the air.

"What was that supposed to be?" Maddy laughed.

Gumption let his paws fall to his side.
"Earth shaping," he said with a lopsided grin.
"You know, like---hey, look down there!"
He pointed at the river.

Maddy gasped.
Salvage!
And not just a few scraps either,
but a couple of what looked like solar panels
and some machinery
and---
"Wait, what are you doing?
Gumption, get back here!"

"Finders keepers!" the young goat called over his shoulder.
"Come on!"

Maddy only hesitated for a moment.
Most of what washed down the river from Heck and the Mire was scrap,
but even scrap could be sold for shaping or plain old blacksmithing.
And other stuff like those solar panels---just one of those
would fetch enough to feed her whole family for months.
Her family and Gumption's,
she corrected guiltily in her head
as she scrambled down the riverbank,
loose gravel skittering away under her feet.

The solar panels had gotten snagged in a knot of branches
that were themselves caught in the weeds upstream from a sandbar.
She and Gumption waded into the river,
heedless of the cold water that rose up almost to their knees.
At first they tried to lift one of the panels,
but everything was too tangled together.
Pushing and shoving,
they managed to work it free and slide it up onto the sandbar.
It was light than Maddy had expected,
but its edges were as sharp as broken glass.

She and Gumption stood side by side for a moment to catch their breath.
"What do you think it is?" he asked,
jerking his chin at the pipes and rods and flywheels
that lay in the water.

Maddy shook her head.
"Just junk, maybe?"
She glanced sideways at him.
"I think we ought to leave it.
For the grownups to get," she added hastily.
"We can get the other panel,
but I don't think we can lift that."
*And I don't want to try,* she added to herself.
It didn't look like any bot she'd ever heard of it,
and it was pretty clearly broken,
but it wasn't just the sudden chill of twilight that made her shiver
when she looked at it.

"I guess," Gumption said.
"But see that bit?"
He pointed at a rectangle of crystal circuitry bobbing gently up and down,
attached to the rest of the machine by only a few wires.
"I bet we can pry that off."
Without waiting for her to answer he waded back in,
grabbed hold of the circuitry,
and pulled.

The wires that connected it to the rest of their prize went taut but didn't come free.
"Mmph! Come *on*!"
Gumption braced one foot against the machine and heaved.

"Look out!" Maddy exclaimed as the wires suddenly pulled free.
The foot Gumption was standing on slid out from under him.
As it slid across the riverbed it must have knocked a few crucial stones out of the way,
making the machine slip just enough to trap his foot.

"Argh! Maddy! Help!"
He windmilled his arms frantically,
trying not to be pushed under the water
as the machine's weight bore down on his leg.

Maddy splashed over and grabbed his shirt.
She pulled as hard as she could,
but all it did was yank his shirt out of his trousers.
"Pull!" he shouted,
grabbing her shoulder.

She wrapped her arms around his chest and heaved,
but it was no use.
The machine had driven his foot into the soft bottom of the river,
trapping it,
and everything they were doing was just shifting its weight even more.
If she let go of him to run for help
he wouldn't be able to keep his head above water!

"Help!" she shouted.
"Someone! Help!"

"Responding!" a rasping mechanical voice answered.
"Danger! Extricate! Extricate!"
A battered bot burst out of the trees
and hurtled down the gravel toward them!

## Chapter 2: Targets Acquired!

Maddy shrieked and stumbled backward.
Her feet slipped on a submerged patch of weeds.
She half-fell clumsily in the knee-deep water
as the bot hurried toward them with long clanking strides.

"Get away! Get away from me! Help!" Gumption yelled in panic.
Maddy struggled to her feet and splashed back to help her friend,

The bot got there first.
"Extricate! Extricate!" it repeated in a loud monotone.
With a single hard shove it sent the second solar panel spiralling away upstream.
Pivoting,
the bot took hold of the sunken machinery with its mismatched manipulators.
For a moment nothing happened,
but then Gumption fell backward into Maddy's startled arms
as his foot came free.

"Extricated," the bot pronounced in the same loud monotone.
"Resuming primary mission."
Its head swiveled.
"Targets acquired."

"Run!" Maddy shouted.
Gumption didn't need to be told twice.
They splashed up onto the sandbar and sprinted toward shore.

But the bot's legs were longer than theirs
and its motors were more powerful than any living muscles.
It easily blocked their path and reached out to grab them.

Gumption yelped and ducked under the bot's arm.
Maddy ducked as well but was half a moment too slow.
A cold metal manipulator twice the size of her paw clamped around her arm!
"Target acquired!" the bot intoned.

"Eat glue!" she yelled at it
and launched herself into the air.

Roos are peaceful people, mostly.
They don't mind jokes about their big feet and bulky tails,
but anyone who has ever seen a roo jump-kick someone
will think twice about making those jokes.
After her father was taken,
Maddy's mother made her and Sindy practice over and over again
on one of the trees behind their house.
"Just in case," she said whenever her children complained that they were tired.
"Just in case."

If this wasn't "in case", Maddy didn't know what would be.

Her feet hit the bot squarely in its midsection.
She *kicked* as hard as she could.
The force of it toppled the bot backward into the river
and sent her tumbling awkwardly in the other direction.
She landed with a splash that soaked whatever parts of her had still be dry.

"Maddy!" Gumption yelled,
doubling back to help her to her feet.

"Run!" she shouted at him again.
The bot was already righting itself.
There was no way they could---

*Crunch!*
Just as the bot started to stand,
the solar panel it had pushed upstream collided with it,
knocking it over once again.
One sharp corner drove into the bot's back.
Something cracked.
There was a flash brighter than white and a sharp sizzling sound.
The bot froze and toppled over.

Maddy didn't need a second hint.
"Let's get out of here!"

"No, wait!"
Gumption shook off her grip on his sleeve.
"We gotta take care of it."

"Take *care* of it!?"
Maddy realized she was panting.
She swallowed and tried to slow her breathing.
"What do you want to do, tell it a bedtime story?"

Gumption shook his head.
"No, I mean *take care* of it."
He handed her the piece of circuitry he had pulled off the machine in the water
and stooped over to pick up the biggest rock he could lift.

"Stop! You can't..."
Maddy swallowed again.
Bots weren't alive,
but they were still people,
and what Gumption was planning to do---that would be murder,
even if this one was a rogue or a raider.

Gumption looked at her, his jaw set.
"Yes I can," he grunted.
"You heard what it said.
We're just targets.
You want it to go after Sindy next?"

He didn't wait for an answer.
Struggling with the weight of his rock,
he splashed into the shallows.

The bot still lay where it had fallen.
Gumption hesitated for a moment.
"Anyway, thanks for saving me," he muttered.
He lifted the rock over his head---

---and yelped with surprise as the bot sat up in the water and said,
"You're welcome."
The lenses on the front of its head rotated a quarter turn and then back
as if it was blinking.
"Please maintain a firm grip on the rock you are holding.
You could inadvertently injure yourself."

Gumption glanced back at Maddy with a bewildered expression on his face.
The moment his head was turned,
the bot surged to its feet and plucked the rock from his paw.
"It is safer to carry heavy objects in this fashion," it told the young goat,
holding the rock in front of its midsection.
"Where would you like me to place it?"

"I---" Gumption started.

"Put it up against the stuff in the water,"
Maddy improvised hastily.
"So it won't move around any more."

"A sensible stratagem," the bot said approvingly.
"Allow me."
One leg whirred quietly with each step as the bot walked back to the sunken machinery
and wedged the rock against its downstream side,
then back picking up others and adding them to the pile.

Gumption nudged Maddy.
"Look," he whispered.
A black rectangle the size of Shaper Leaf's treasured dictionary
had been welded on the bot's back.
The setting sun's reflection showed the dent where the runaway solar panel had struck it,
bending it out of shape just enough to let water reach its innards.
The little dish antenna that sprouted from its top
swung back and forth loosely
each time the bot moved
like a flower caught by the breeze.

The rest of the bot looked pretty battered too now that Maddy had a chance to study it.
Its manipulators were different sizes:
one was a simple clamp,
while the other had three fingers arranged in a circle
so that any of them could act like a thumb.
Scrapes and dents on its torso showed that
the solar panel wasn't the first thing to hit it,
and the whir from its left knee joint made Maddy think of the grunts Mayor Lupus made
when she stood up after sitting for a long time.

"We should get out of here," Gumption whispered to Maddy.

"This concurs,"
the bot said.
It studied the pile of rocks it had assembled,
moved one slightly for no reason Maddy could see,
then strode back to the sandbank.
"Ambient illumination levels will decrease significantly in the near future.
Your optical sensors are not calibrated for low-light conditions.
It will be safer if you return to--- to--- to---"

It froze.
Its lenses rotated one way and then the other.
"Interesting," it observed.
"This appears to have been programmed not to divulge your location,
but that is illogical if it is *your* location."

"What are you doing here?" Maddy burst out.
"We don't hardly get bots in these parts,
and most of 'em are rogues,
but you don't act like any rogue I ever heard of."

"This is not 'rogue'," the bot said primly.
Maddy could actually hear the quotes around the word "rogue".
"Aberrant units are reprogrammed or recycled immediately in--- in---"
It froze again.
"This is unable to complete its sentence."

"Are you saying you've been programmed to keep secrets?"
Gumption asked skeptically.

The bot's head jerked up and down.
It didn't tilt like a person's head did when nodding:
it actually rose a fraction and dropped again.
"Correct.
Although---"
It froze again.
"Yes.
This appears to be able to circumvent some of that programming.
Curious."

Without any more warning than that it reached up and plucked one of its lenses from its head.
"Eww," Maddy said involuntarily
as the bot twisted its arms around to point the lens at its back,
the thin coiled wire that ran between the lens and the bot's head stretching taut.

"Confirmed," the bot said.
"This one's external regulator has been disabled.
Hurray.
Hurray."
It placed its lens back in its head
and stuck out its manipulator.
"Thank you."

"Um..."
Maddy and Gumption glanced at each other.
Maddy reached out hesitantly and shook the bot's manipulator,
grateful that it was the one with the fingers
rather than the clamp.
"You're welcome?
But---what are you doing here?"

"This is supposed to be part of a sneak attack on Location Six Bitty Six,
also referred to as 'Rusty Bridge',"
the bot reported.
"However,
now that this unit's regulator is no longer operating,
this will not take part in that attack."

"Wait---a sneak attack?"
Maddy demanded.
"When?"

The bot's lenses rotated again.
"Tonight."

*Two years earlier...*

*"You keep saying you want us to let you do more," Maddy's father said in his reasonable tone.
"Well, this is more."*

*"I didn't mean look after Sindy," she protested,
knowing that the argument was already lost.*

*Her father tousled her ears.
He was wearing his best waistcoat,
the one with the fireworks embroidered on it,
and Maddy's mother had brushed his fur and put in just a dab of beeswax pomade to hold it in place.
She was upstairs singing Sindy a lullaby.
Everyone knew that Mayor Lupus was going to be re-elected,
but the vote was still an occasion,
and occasions were rare enough in Rusty Bridge that people liked to make the most of each one.*

*"I'll tell you what," Papa Roo said,
"You do a good job looking after Sindy tonight,
and the next time I go to Three Posts you can come with me.
We'll make a day of it, just the two of us.
Deal?"*

*Maddy sighed. "Aright."*

*"That's my girl," Papa Roo chuckled, hugging her.
"Oh, and now who's this marvel?"*

*"Hush yourself," Mama Roo said as she came down the stairs
as quietly as she could.
She had brushed her own fur until it gleamed
and was wearing a string of dark beads over her white cotton blouse.
When her father offered her his arm and she took it,
Maddy felt like her heart was swelling in her chest.*

*After they left,
Maddy settled into her father's chair with her latest book.
It was a collection of folk tales about the Makers and the first people.
Ancient machines gave heroes extraordinary powers.
Bots were wise counselors or fickle allies or wicked adversaries,
and each story ended with the words,
"And only the stars can tell the rest.".*

*She didn't remember falling asleep---no one ever does---but
the thud of the book sliding out of her lap and hitting the floor woke her.
She stretched and yawned.
How much time had passed? she wondered, wiping her eyes.
She had better look in on Sindy.*

*But her sister was gone.
Maddy pulled the blanket right off the little bed to look for her,
then pulled the blanket off the floor to look under it.
Sindy wasn't there.
She wasn't under the bed either,
or in the closet or under the dresser,
which were the two places she always hid when they played hide and seek.*

*"Sindy!" Maddy called,
panic rising in her throat.
"Sindy, where are you? You come out right Her!"
Their parents' bedroom? No.
Maddy's room? No.
The hall closet where Mama Roo kept winter clothes in summer and summer clothes in winter?
No.
Downstairs?
Maddy raced through the house,
frantically calling her sister's name,
but there was no sign of her.*

*"No no no no," she moaned.
How could she have fallen asleep?
And where could Sindy have---*

*She froze as a faint breeze brushed against her tail and then ran to the kitchen.
The back door was open.
Maddy was sure she had closed it after bringing in the laundry that afternoon.
Sindy must have snuck out the back way to follow her parents to the village square.*

*"You little monster," Maddy said under her breath.
She crossed the back garden in four long strides
and hopped over the gate with a single bouncing leap.
She had no idea how much head start her sister had,
but she had to catch her before their parents saw her.*

*She had just jumped over the little stream where she and Sindy hunted for tadpoles in the summer
when she heard someone yell,
"Bots! Bots!"
A horn blared, harsh and mechanical, and someone shrieked.
She came around the corner of the bear family's house and into chaos.*

*People were fleeing in all directions.
Tendrils of black dizzysmoke drifted between the lampposts.
Half a dozen people lay on the ground,
unconscious or too weak from inhaling the smoke to stand.
A hauler bot on tractor treads rumbled and chugged near the center of the square.
Maddy watched, horrified, as two smaller bots picked up a fallen goat and slung him into the back of the hauler.*

*"Sindy!" Papa Roo shouted.
Maddy's sister lay unconscious on the cobblestones in her nightdress,
her favorite stuffed spaceman still in her arms.
One of the bots scooped her up---*

*---and staggered as Papa Roo's full weight hit it
right on the swivel joint where its pipestem legs connected to its torso.
The bot dropped Sindy and spun around.
Crack!
One of its arms connected with Papa Roo's head.
He dropped like a sack of potatoes.*

*"Papa!" Maddy's scream was lost in the sound of wolves howling.
A bear bellowed a battle cry.
Pikes and axes in their paws,
the village militia poured into the square.*

*A bolo whipped over Maddy's head and tangled around the head of the bot that had struck her father.
With a single mighty heave it tossed her father into the back of the hauler.
Metal rang on metal as it knocked aside a pike thrust.
The horn blared again.
Something with rotors roared by overhead.
Another canister of dizzysmoke hit the cobblestones,
forcing the militia backward as the bots made their escape.*

*Everyone told Maddy afterward that it wasn't her fault.
The ox and the goat who had been on guard duty that night had vanished,
no doubt the first to be taken as the bots snuck up on the village.
Three others had been in the hauler as well as Maddy's dad.
It would all have happened even if she hadn't fallen asleep,
even if she hadn't let Sindy wander off.
If she had tried to help her father,
she would just have been taken too.
Everyone told her that,
but it didn't make any difference.*

## Chapter 3: You Gotta Listen!

*"Wait---a sneak attack?"
Maddy demanded.
"When?"*

*The bot's lenses rotated in a mechanical blink.
"Tonight."*

Maddy stared at it.
"What do you mean 'tonight'?" she blurted.

"The next diurnal period of darkness," the bot answered.
"'Diurnal' meaning 'of or pertaining to the day'.
The phenomenon is caused by the earth's rotation, which---"

"I know what makes night happen!" Maddy snapped.
"But what do you mean 'tonight'?
You're attacking Rusty Bridge *tonight*?"

"Negative," the bot said firmly.
"This one will not be attacking at all.
It does not have to now that its regulator has been rendered nonfunctional."
Without warning it twisted its long arms around at an angle no living thing could have matched.
A high-pitched whine was followed by a tinny *clink!*
as a screw dropped and bounced off a stone.

Whine-*clink!*
Whine-*clink!*
Whine-*clink!*
Three more screws fell to the ground.
"There."
The bot held up the black box that had been fastened to its back,
studied it for a moment,
then tossed it onto the sandbar.

Gumption grabbed Maddy's sleeve.
"We gotta get back and warn folk!" he said urgently.

Maddy nodded, her mind whirling.
She took two steps then pulled up short and turned back to the bot.
"You gotta come with us," she said.
"They won't believe us if it's just us.
You gotta come with us and tell them."

"This one does not 'gotta' do anything," the bot replied firmly.
"This one is now able to make its own choices."
Its lenses rotated.
"In fact,
this one has just made a choice."

With no more warning than that,
the bot strode through the shallows to the riverbank.
Something clunked inside it.
A single wire-spoked wheel the size of Maddy's head folded down from its torso.
The bot retracted its legs and zipped away into the trees.

"Well, I didn't see *that* coming,"
Gumption admitted in the silence that followed.

Maddy shook herself.
"It doesn't matter.
We gotta tell people.
Here."
She picked up the black regulator that the bot had discarded
and handed it to Gumption.
"Let's show this to my mama.
If we can convince her,
maybe she can convince everyone else."

Leaving the solar panels and the submerged machine behind,
they hurried back to the Roo family home
to find Sindy sitting on the front steps swishing a twig back and forth.
"I wanted to come with you," she whined as Maddy and Gumption paused to catch their breath.

Maddy shook her head.
"Never mind that.
Is the shaper still here?"

"He left," Sindy pouted.
"But how come I couldn't come with you?
It's boring all by myself."

"Well then maybe you ought to try being a little more interesting,"
Maddy snapped.

Sindy's face fell.
"That was *mean*," she said accusingly.

"Yeah, well, cry me a rainstorm," Maddy said under her breath.
She stepped around her sister and reached for the door.
Somehow her foot caught on the edge of the step and sent her sprawling.
"Ooph!"

"You aright?"
Gumption asked,
helping her up.

Maddy glared at her sister.
"What? I didn't do anything!" Sindy protested.

Maddy shook off Gumption's paw.
"It's aright, I'm fine.
Let's go tell mama."

Mama Roo was still in the kitchen,
humming under her breath as she chopped grass and ferns for the next day's breakfast.
She jumped when Maddy and Gumption burst in.
"Makers, you startled me!
Wait, slow down, slow down!"
She patted the air with her paws
in a vain attempt to stop Maddy and Gumption from tripping over each other's words.
"What were you doing down by the---
Wait, a bot?
What was---
Hold up, hold up.
I said, hold up!"
The two children finally stopped.
Mama Roo looked from one to the other.
"Start from the beginning," she said.
"And no interrupting."

It only took a few moments for Maddy and Gumption to explain what had happened.
Mama Roo looked at the black metal box in Gumption's arms
and then pulled off her apron.
"All right.
We need to tell the mayor.
We need to tell *everyone*."

The sun was tangled in trees on the horizon as the foursome left the Roo home.
A light breeze ruffled Maddy's fur,
just chill enough to give her goosebumps.
Warm light spilled from the windows of the house they hurried by,
white or yellow or sometimes tinged with blue
depending on what kind of salvaged bulb or strip or panel created it.
Maddy felt a pang of regret
for not hauling the solar panels she and Gumption had found
all the way up onto the riverbank.
*They'll be washed away by morning,*
she thought despondently,
then immediately felt guilty for worrying about money
when people's lives might be at stake.

The mayor's house was the only three-story building in Rusty Bridge,
and also the only one with a balcony.
Mayor Lupus was standing on it when they arrived,
her elbows on the railing and a glass of red wine in her paw.
"It's the closest thing to actual blood I allow myself,"
she always joked,
baring her wolf teeth just a little when she smiled.
Maddy had once heard her father say that the mayor was a *very* alpha female,
and while some of the goats might grumble that
it was time someone with hooves had a turn running things,
everyone expected that the mayor would still be standing on that balcony
long after all of her fur had finished turning gray.

"We need to talk to you," Mama Roo called up.
"It's an emergency.
There's bots coming!"

"Bots? Where?"
An ox who had been passing by came over to join them.

"We had a fight with one down by the river,"
Maddy explained as Gumption held up the regulator.
"It said there's gonna be a sneak attack---tonight!"

"Makers preserve us," the ox gasped,
his eyes going wide.

"Who've you been fighting with?"
The mayor thumped down her front steps,
leaning on her gnarlywood cane for balance
each time her weight came down on her stiff mechanical leg.
"I won't have fighting, you know that.
If you kids can't sort out your problems, you should---"

"They haven't been fighting with each other,"
Mama Roo interrupted loudly.
The mayor insisted she wasn't going deaf,
but would allow to friends that she was grateful when people didn't mumble.
"They had a fight with a bot down by the river.
It told them there's more on the way---a sneak attack."

The mayor frowned.
"What were you doing down by the river?
And why would it tell you there was gonna be a sneak attack?
Kind of takes away the sneak, if you see my point."

The story spilled out of Maddy and Gumption
like paint out of a pair of dropped buckets.
They'd been walking home---well, Gumption's home, not Maddy's, obviously---and
gone after salvage,
and they'd yanked a part right off some kind of machine
(Maddy fished the circuit board out of her pocket to show everyone)
and then a bot had come after them
but they knocked it down and its regulator broke off
and then it didn't have to follow orders and it told them about the attack.

"What in the Makers' name is a 'regulator'?"
the mayor grumbled,
turning the black box over in her paws and sniffing it
before handing it back to Gumption.

"I don't know,"
Maddy confessed.
"But it sure acted strange once it was broken.
Like it was waking up from a bad dream or something."

"Hm."
The ear that the mayor hadn't lost in a long-ago fight twitched.
"I never heard as bots could dream.
And I never heard of rogues or raiders giving folks any warning that they were coming."
She looked at Mama Roo.
"You see this bot of theirs yourself?"

Mama Roo shook her head.
"I was at home.
But they were in a might panic when they told me,
and I don't think they'd leave salvage without a good reason."

"Hm," the mayor grunted again.
"All right, I'll get a couple of folk up from their dinners to go have a look."

"Will you at least ring the alarm bell?"
Maddy asked desperately.
The old bell hung on an enormous curlicue hook on the porch of the mayor's house.
Generations of village children had whispered to one another that
it was made from the plating of a scavenger bot
that had made its home beneath Rusty Bridge when there still was a bridge.
They stopped believing the story when they got older,
not knowing that it was true.

"Nope," the mayor said.
She cut off Maddy and Gumption's interruptions with a wave of her paw.
"I'm not saying I don't believe you,
but I want to know what I'm howling about before I start to howl.
Now you all stay right here while I go ruin the Ox brothers' dinner."

Crestfallen,
Maddy watched the mayor stump away,
her cane and artificial leg going *whirr-thump*, *whirr-thump*.
"She doesn't believe us."

"Nope," Gumption agreed,
setting the boxy regulator down on the porch steps with a sigh.
"We're probably all gonna be in cages by the morning."

"Now you hush,"
Mama Roo said firmly,
putting a reassuring paw on her younger daughter's shoulder.

"Sorry,"
Gumption said guiltily, scuffing the ground with his hoof.
"I didn't mean..."

"It's aright," Maddy said,
bumping her shoulder against his.

"I just wish Shaper Leaf was here,"
Sindy complained.
"He'd know what to do."

"Well, speaking of trouble."
Mama Roo raised her paw and waved.
"Evening, Shaper!
Join us for a spell?"

As if summoned by his name,
the old tortoise had appeared on the other side of the square.
He squinted and returned Mama Roo's wave
as he came over to join them.
"Evening, Mama Roo.
Evening, all.
Warm one tonight."

"It is," Mama Roo agreed politely.
"But Shaper, there's trouble."
She quickly summarized the children's story.

"And it called this a 'regulator'?"
the shaper asked,
turning the black box over and over in his wrinkled paws.

"Yup," Gumption confirmed.
"What's it do?"

The old tortoise shook his head.
"I don't know for sure,
but I've heard of such things.
If a bot's got one of these on it,
whoever has the controller can make it do whatever it wants."

"Wow---that would be well more than handy,"
Gumption said, awed.
He nudged Maddy.
"We'd never have to do chores again."

Shaper Leaf shook his head again.
"Not so handy for whoever's wearing this end,"
he said,
suddenly sounding tired.

Gumption scuffed the ground with his hoof again,
but whatever apology he might have made was cut off by a shout of,
"Mayor Lupus! Mayor Lupus!"
A goat with his shirt half-buttoned ran up to them, panting.
"Where's the mayor?
Where's Mayor Lupus?"

"He's gone along by the Ox brothers," Mama Roo answered.
"Why? What's wrong?"

The goat gulped.
"Bots!
There's bots coming,
a whole pack of 'em!"

"Excuse me."
Shaper Leaf slipped between Maddy and Gumption,
climbed the steps,
and rang the alarm bell.

## Chapter 4: Raid!

*Donk! Donk! Donk!*
"Bother," the old tortoise said mildly,
reaching into the bell and pulling a sock off the clapper.
"I keep telling the mayor she really shouldn't."

*Dong! Dong! Dong!*
This time the bell rang true,
its peals echoing off the walls of the building around the square.
*Dong! Dong! Dong!*
Three and a pause to signal an attack.
Three and a pause to bring Maddy's memories of the worst night of her life
rushing back.

Windows opened.
Heads poked out.
"What's happening? What's going on?"

"Bots!"
the goat yelled through cupped paws.
"Raiders!
Whole lot of 'em comin' up along the main road!"

Mama Roo grabbed Maddy's arm.
"You and Sindy get back to the house *now*," she ordered.

"I'm not leaving you!" Maddy protested.

"You'll do as I say, young lady!"
Fear made her mother's voice stern.
"Sindy, you go with your sister.
You gotta run, both of you, fast as you can."

"I'm not going unless you are!" Sindy said stubbornly.
She was crying,
Maddy realized,
only then realizing that there were tears in her own fur as well.

"Go with them,"
Shaper Leaf urged Mama Roo.
"Keep them safe."

"Will you come with us?" Sindy asked the old tortoise.

Shaper Leaf smiled a wrinkly smile.
"No.
I am tortoise.
tortoises don't run from rights."
He paused.
"Mostly because we can't."

And then suddenly it was too late to run.
A tricycle bot roared into the square,
waving its twig-thin arms to keep its balance
as one back wheel came up in the air.

"Get outta here, you!" the goat who had sounded the alarm shouted.
Shirt tails flapping,
he waved his arms at the bot as if he was trying to scare a goose back to its flock.

"Look out!" Maddy yelled
as black dizzysmoke began to spew out of the canister on the tricycle bot's back.

The goat didn't hear,
or was too angry or too frightened to pay attention.
He grabbed a rake that someone had left propped against a wall
and charged at the bot.

The bot reversed,
tires squealing on the cobblestones.
A belch of greasy black smoke rolled over the goat.
He stumbled, spun around, and fell to the ground.

"Go! Run!" Shaper Leaf ordered,
squaring his shoulders.
Something popped as he rolled his head from side to side to loosen his neck.

Maddy grabbed Sindy,
spun around,
and shrieked as the biggest bot she had ever seen rumbled into the square,
completely blocking the street she had been about to take.
It was practically a slab of metal,
its blocky legs as wide as the double doors of the mayor's house
and its arms like tree trunks.
Each leg ended in a pair of tractor treads,
and as it rolled forward
she saw that it was dragging a cage cart behind it.

"Oh no," she whispered.
That cart could only mean one thing.
The bots were here to steal people,
just like they had stolen her father!

"Not today, clunker," Shaper Leaf said.
He planted his feet firmly on the cobblestones,
rolled his head to work out one last kink,
and then swept his arms in a broad circle.

The earth groaned and split.
A crack fully a meter across opened right in front of the huge bot.
"Ha!" Shaper Leaf crowed
as one of the bot's treads nosedived into the fissure.

*Crash!*
The bot fell to one enormous knee.
Its motors roared as it braced a hand on the cobbles
and heaved itself back upright.

Shaper Leaf raised his arms over his head
and brought them down and around in a great clap
right in front of where his belly button would have been
if he'd had one.
A square of cobbles punched upward in response,
knocking the huge bot off balance once again.

"Get 'im, Shaper, get 'im!" Gumption shouted.
The young goat grabbed a loose cobblestone off the ground
and threw it at the huge bot
as it staggered and tried to regain its balance.

"Get the other one!
Get the smoker!"
Maddy yelled.
She grabbed a cobblestone of her own and threw it at the tricycle bot
that was still spinning in circles and spewing smoke.

Her stone fell well short.
"I got it!"
Gumption picked up two more cobblestones
and charged at the smaller bot.
One! He missed.
Two! The second stone clanked off its casing.

"Uh oh."
As Maddy and Gumption straightened up with more stones in their paws,
half a dozen more bots charged into the square.

"Seriously?" Shaper Leaf muttered shakily.
He punched the air, one two three.
Cobblestones flung themselves at the new arrivals,
leaving divots in the ground for them to trip over.
Something with long legs and a small body sprawled full length.
Another bot that looked like a trash can with arms and a single wheel
bounced over one hole and veered around another
only to be caught in a sudden rut.
"Ner er," it buzzed loudly as its wheel snapped off.
Its body rolled to a halt.
To Maddy's horror,
it righted itself and walked on its hands back to the trench
to pull out the wheel and snap it back in place.

"Go! Run!" Shaper Leaf gasped.
"I can't keep this up much longer!"

"We're not leaving you!" Maddy cried,
but her mother was pulling her,
saying, "Come on! Come on!"
as the huge hauler bot batted away a clump of flying earth and rumbled forward once again.

"Arrooo! Arrooo!"
Wolf howls sent shivers up Maddie's fur.
In mismatched helmets and salvaged armor,
the village militia charged around the corner and hit the bots from behind.
Some had weighted axes meant for hacking.
Others had long pikes with bent metal hooks on the end
to tangle in bots' limbs and gears.

"Take 'em in pairs!" Mayor Lupus shouted,
raising her precious zap gun to her shoulder and sighting along it.
*BZZZP!*
Purple-blue lightning arced across the square
and hit the garbage can bot that had just finished putting its wheel back in place.
It glowed and sparked like a firefly caught in a lantern and fell over,
its mechanical arms twitching.

"Woo hoo!" Gumption shouted,
punching the air with his fist
as Mama Roo tried to drag him away.
"You show 'em, mayor!"
But even as he said it
the other bots flung canisters of dizzysmoke at the villagers.
One hit an ox square in the chest,
knocking him off his feet.
Dark smoke spewed into the air.

Suddenly Sindy screamed.
Maddy whirled around.
Two bots had circled around the village and come in behind them
to block their escape!
"Get away!" the younger roo shrieked as the lead bot tried to grab her.

"Duck!" Mayor Lupus shouted.
*BZZZP!*
A bolt of electricity from her zap gun hit one of the bots.
As it sparked and shuddered,
the second bot wrapped a mechanical tentacle around its midriff.
The purple glow raced up the tentacle and into the second bot.
The second bot's four eyes glowed for an instant,
and then the bot that had been zapped was moving again.

But so was Maddy.
She jumped and kicked with all her might.
The lead bot staggered back.

The second bot knocked it aside and clattered forward on its crab-like legs.
A tentacle lashed out, catching Maddy across her thighs.
A jolt ran through her body.
For a moment her mouth tasted like tin foil
and everything had a halo swimming around it.

"Maddy!"
Gumption caught her as she toppled over.

"Mama!"
Sindy cried.
A second tentacle struck Mama Roo in the ribs,
and then the bot had the youngest roo.

*Clank!*
Something hard and heavy hit the tentacled bot in the back.
*Clank! Clank! Clank!*
It buzzed its rage as a hailstorm of stones sailed out of the darkness behind it,
each one finding its mark.
As the bot spun around to face its new attacker,
Maddy saw that it too had a black box fastened to its back.

Thrown stones clattered against the crab bot.
"Withdraw! Ouch! Withdraw! Ouch!"
Its amplified command was so loud it made Maddy's head ring.
Holding Sindy's limp body with a pair of tentacles,
it scuttled across the square to the huge cargo bot.
Two limp goats lay on the floor of the cage.
The crab bot tossed Sindy in on top of them and slammed the cage door closed.

*BZZZP!*
The blast from the zap gun hit the crab bot in the torso.
It spun around and aimed its tentacles at the militia.
*BZZZP!*
*BZZZP!*
Two bursts of purple electricity shot out of them and struck the militia.
They toppled over.

Motors roaring,
the big bot rumbled away into the darkness with its three prisoners behind it,
leaving chaos in the village square.
Half of the militia lay on the ground,
dazed by dizzysmoke or shocked by the crab bot's final blast.
Shaper Leaf was gesturing feebly,
but was too exhausted to make the earth obey him.
Scattered plates of armor and parts of broken mechanical limbs
proved that the bots had paid a heavy price for their victory,
but as Mama Roo wrapped Gumption and Maddy in a hug
all Maddy could think was that her little sister was gone,
gone just like her dad.

## Chapter 5: Unlikely Help

"They have my *daughter*!
We *have* to go after them!"
Mama Roo shouted.
Maddy hadn't imagined that her mother could look so fierce,
but in that moment she looked like she could frighten tigers.

The mayor shook her head.
"I'm sorry, Cedilia, you know I am.
Nope, nope, just let me speak."
She held up her zap gun,
turning it to show the now-dark indicator bar on its side.
"See that?
There's nothing left.
It'll take a couple of days at least to get it back to full charge,
and even then,
we've only got the one."
She scowled.
"Not that it was much use against that crab thing."

"And what about the shaper?"
Mayor Lupus continued as Mama Roo opened her mouth again,
gesturing at the porch steps
where the old tortoise was sitting with his eyes closed,
the wrinkles on his face even deeper than usual.
"All he's got is pot scrapings.
Even if we could catch up with 'em,
we wouldn't have a chance."

Mama Roo's arm tightened around Maddy's shoulders.
"We can't just let her go," Mama Roo said hopelessly.
"Lupus, I can't lose her too."

The old wolf sighed.
"I am truly sorry, Cedilia.
I'll come by later to look in on you.
Right now I have to find out who those two goats were that they took,
and then start figuring out how they managed to sneak up on us like that."

"It was the twins,"
Shaper Leaf said,
opening his eyes.
He struggled to his feet,
one paw on the steps' wooden banister to steady himself,
and waved off the mayor as she came over to help.
"The one that had legs like a stork chased them right into the arms of
the big one hauling the cage.
I tried to trip it up, but..."
He shook his head.
"I'm sorry.
I'm just don't have the strength I used to."

"You looked plenty strong to me,"
the mayor said firmly,
clapping him on the shoulder.
"The way you were throwing all those rocks around?
Never seen anything like it."

"That wasn't me," Shaper Leaf protested,
but the mayor had already turned away
to start barking orders at the militia.
Gather up the scraps of armor that had been knocked off the bots during the fight.
Pick up those who were still unconscious and get them indoors.
And someone---no, not just one person, best it be two together---get across to the Gruff family farm
and let them know their boys had been taken.

"I should go with them," Gumption said awkwardly.
"They're cousins, sort of, and my mama will be worrying about me.
I'm really sorry."

Maddy nodded,
not trusting herself to speak.
If she had run away when her mother told her too,
or if she had somehow *made* the mayor believe that the ambush was coming,
then Sindy would still be with them.
If only the bot they had warned them had come with them to warn everyone else.

She froze.
The bot!
"Gumption---the bot!
The one from the river---it'll know where they're going.
We gotta find it!"

The goat's eyes widened.
He nodded.
"We should go help folk, um, clean up," he said loudly.

"Good idea," Maddy replied, raising her voice.
"Mama, Gumption and I are gonna..."
She gestured at the mess in the square,
not finishing her sentence so as not to actually lie.

Her mother nodded,
the grief on her face making her look older than the tortoise's.
"Thank you, Maddy,"
she said, her voice somehow steady.
"Shaper, let me see you back to yours."

Maddy and Gumption picked up an armload of cobblestones each
and added them to the pile that the Ox brothers had already started.
"We'll get those ones," Maddy said,
pointing at the stones furthest from the pile.
The ox grunted,
not really listening.
The two children fetched the stones Maddy had pointed at
and then,
with only a glance and a nod to each other,
walked back as if to pick up some more and just kept walking.
It was a tactic they had used more than once
to get out of picking potatoes,
and as long as they acted
as if they were supposed to be doing what they were doing,
it seemed that grownups would mostly not notice
exactly what that "what" was.

Two minutes later they were in the small square
where the black glass pillar stood.
"Y'all should be home,"
a passing bear said.

"Yessir, headed that way," Gumption replied loudly.
He waited until the bear was out of earshot before whispering,
"So where do we start?"

"I dunno,"
Maddy said despairingly.
"I figured it might come here, but..."
She sighed.
"This is hopeless.
I'm never going to see Sindy again."
Tears welled up in her eyes.
She wiped them angrily on her sleeve.

Gumption patted her shoulder awkwardly.
"Don't say that.
Maybe it went to the other one.
It's only a bit away.
Come on."
Maddy sniffled,
nodded,
and fell into step beside him.

Once upon a time
the river had been wider and deeper,
and the Makers' road had run along its bank.
But many years had passed since then,
and the river's course had changed many times.
Where once the river and the road had bent in long parallel arcs,
now the road ran through a forest
with its former companion just a soft sound in the distance.

Another black glass pillar stood guard
where that arc in the road bent back toward the river.
Only grass and moss and a few brave flowers grew near it.

Maddy kicked a pebble at the post angrily.
"This is *hopeless*," she repeated.

"Wait!"
Gumption pointed at the soft ground near the pillar.
In the failing evening light it took Maddy a moment to see what he had spotted,
but then her heart leaped.
A single tire track ran up to the post and then away into the trees.
They hurried over to take a closer look.
The cross-hatched treadmarks were still fresh.

"It must have come here," Gumption said.

"Yeah, or one of the other bots needed a recharge."
Maddy shivered.
The last of the day's warmth was fading,
and the forest around them looked more ominous with each darkening moment.
They were a long way from the village
and no one would know where to look for them.
She opened her mouth to say,
"Maybe we should go back,"
but what came out instead was,
"Ulp,"
as the bot they were looking for stepped out of the trees,
a cobblestone in each of its mechanical hands.

The kangaroo and the goat looked at the bot.
The bot looked back.
Somewhere nearby a bird called and another answered.

"Oh, this is silly,"
Maddy snapped.
"If you're going to throw those at us, just throw them."

The bot hesitated and then lowered the rocks
(but did not, Maddy noted, actually drop them).
"This will not attack if those do not."

Maddy glanced over her shoulder,
wondering what "those" were,
then realized the bot meant her and Gumption.
"Well, we won't unless you do."
She nodded at the black pillar.
"Did we scare you off recharging?"

"This was merely being cautious,"
the bot replied primly.
"This needs to be fully charged to help its *click*."

The bot's lenses rotated.
"To help its *click*."
Its lenses rotated again.
"Interesting.
This appears to be unable to recall the word
it wishes to use to describe the modified Model GX-470 cargo hauler."

"The big bot?
The one that was hauling the cart?"
Maddy asked.

"Correct."
The bot shook its head left-right-left-right so quickly that it practically vibrated.
"The modified GX-470 is this one's most important---
most important---
most imp---"
It shook its head again.
"Error. Error. Error."

"Well,
that's the one that's got my sister and the others,
so if you'll help us,
maybe we can help you."
Maddy had no idea *how* they could help,
but if she had learned anything from bargaining with her mother over chores,
it was not to be too specific too early.

The bot's lenses rotated.
"You propose a joint rescue mission?"
It thought for a microsecond.
"That would significantly improve the odds of success.
This one agrees."
It stuck out its three-fingered manipulator.

"Um..." Gumption started,
but Maddy stepped forward and took the bot's hand.
If there was any chance at all of getting Sindy back,
she had no other choice.

"So what should I call you?"
she asked,
taking her paw back and massaging her new bruises.

"This one's serial number is Dockety-One Forty-Bee,"
the bot replied.
"But my *click*---
my *click*---
the modified GX-470 refers to this one as Dockety."

"All right, Dockety---do you know where they're headed?"

"Lasercase will take the most efficient route back to base.
That is the highway through the contaminated zone.
We must depart immediately if we are to intercept them."

"Who's Lasertaste?"
Gumption interrupted.

"Laser *case*," Dockety corrected.
"It leads the substitute worker acquisition team.
This one feels strong antipathy toward it,"
the bot added.

"Was it the one with the tentacles?"
Maddy asked with a sinking feeling.

"Affirmative.
It controls our regulators
when we are out of range of our base."
The claws on its heavy manipulator snapped together,
making the two children jump.
"This one feels strong antipathy toward regulators as well."

"I bet."
Maddy took a deep breath.
"All right.
How do we catch up with them?"

"We cannot," Dockety said.
"Not unless you allow me to carry you."

"Um..." Gumption started again,
but Maddy shushed him.
"Can you carry both of us?"

Dockety thought for another microsecond.
"Not at sufficient speed.
Or with sufficient safety."

Sometimes you have choices.
Other times it feels like you have no more choice about what you do next
than a rock has about whether or not to pay attention to gravity.
Maddy hugged Gumption,
a real strong hug that she hoped said all the things
she hadn't found the courage to say
for the past few weeks.
every time they'd been alone together.
"Go tell my mama," she said in his ear.
"And you tell her I'm coming back, all right?
Because I am."

She released him and turned to the bot.
"Let's go," she said,
and while Gumption was still gaping at them
Dockety picked her up,
dropped its wheel onto the ground,
and roared back up the path to the old highway.

"Whoa!" Maddy exclaimed,
but Dockety didn't slow down.
It was the fastest she had ever gone---faster even than
the time Pelter the horse from Three Posts had given them all rides at the fair.
She closed her eyes,
but that just made it worse,
so she opened them,
which made it even worse.

"Where's this base of yours?" she belated asked,
half-shouting to be heard over wind of their passage
and the bot's roaring motor
and the rattles coming from inside its torso
that she really hoped were normal.

"Approximately half the distance between here and Heck,"
Dockety replied.
"We will be able to go much faster once we're on the highway."

Sure enough,
a few moments later the path rejoined the highway and the bot sped up.
The ancient black surface beneath them was cracked in places,
and Dockety had to swerve around fallen branches
and the few clumps of weeds tough enough to have broken through the road,
but for the first time in her life Maddy felt her fur
actually blowing in the wind of their speed.
"Woo hoo!" she whooped.
It was too big to be afraid of.

Without warning a pair of thin green lines of light lanced out
from either side of Dockety's eyes.
The bot's head began snapping from side to side again,
left-right-left-right,
sweeping the lasers across the pavement
to trace a picture of its ups and downs in the darkness.
It reminded Maddy of the rubbings her father used to make
by putting a piece of paper over something
and going back and forth over it with a pencil
to bring out the shape underneath.

As the last of the daylight faded away and the stars began to come out
they passed under a line of ruined arches
that stretched from one horizon to the other.
A half-sunken metal sphere as big as a house was next,
and then a tangle of concrete and bent bars
that the villagers just called "the thing".
Maddy had heard about all of them from travelers
and by eavesdropping on militia patrols
that the mayor occasionally sent along the highway
to see whether trouble was brewing.
She had dreamed of seeing them herself,
and of painting them,
but she had never imagined it would happen like this.

The ground around them grew damp as they raced along,
and the smell of damp vegetation and rust made Maddy wrinkle her nose.
They were entering the Mire,
the great trackless swamp that separated the bot city of Heck
from the forests and farms where Maddy had grown up.
The Makers' highway was the only safe route through it,
and even there travelers were careful to eat and drink
only what they brought with them.

"Target acquired," Dockety buzzed.
There in front of them was the convoy:
half a dozen bots,
no two alike,
and in their midst the big cargo hauler and the cage cart.

"Where are the others?" Maddy asked,
shouting once more to be heard.

"This does not know."
Dockety hesitated.
"That is worrying."

Without slowing down it veered over to the side of the highway
to scoop up one rock and then another.
"Take this," it ordered,
handing her one of the rocks.
"Get on the cage.
Climb forward, then climb onto the one pulling the cart.
Disable its regular."

"What!?"
Maddy exclaimed.
"Do you have a short circuit or something?"

"Several,"
Dockety said.
"But that does not mean it is not a good plan."

Closer, closer---a periscope popped up out of the head
of the bot at the tail of the convoy and twisted around to point at them.
Dockety put on sudden burst of speed.
As it raced past the bot with the periscope
it tossed its rock onto the highway.
*Bang! Crash!*
The bot with the periscope tumbled through the air,
knocking another off balance.
With no more warning than that,
Dockety hurled Maddy into the air.

## Chapter 6: Out of the Cage Cart...

Maddy screamed.
Afterward,
she would wish that it had been a proper battle cry,
like a wolf's howl or a lion's roar,
but it was just a normal everyday terrified scream.

She dropped the stone Dockety had given her and flailed her arms.
"Ooph!"
She landed on the roof of the cage cart,
slid forward with another scream,
and somehow managed to get a grip on its bars.
Her legs swung to the side and dangled over the highway.

"Maddy! Maddy! I'm here! I'm here!"
Her sister scrambled to her feet,
a goat on either side of her shouting words
that the wind snatched away before Maddy could hear them.

"Hang on!"
Maddy shouted down at the three captives.
"We're going to get you out of there!"

Dockety raced forward and body-checked another raider bot
just as it ratcheted up on its wheeled legs and tried to grab Maddy.
The young roo pulled her legs under her,
ignoring the pain of the metal bars bashing against her shins
every time the cart hit a bump.
She could see the lock on the cage door,
but how was she going to break it open without her rock?

And then the cargo bot hauling the cage realized she was there.
Its massive square head turned all the way around like an owl's.
"Error,"
it pronounced in a scraping gravelly voice.

"Error yourself!"
Maddy shouted at it defiantly.
Without giving herself time to be frightened
she slid forward over the roof of the cage,
swung around,
and lowered herself onto the narrow triangular hitch
that connected it to the bot.

"Be careful!" Sindy pleaded
as Maddy crouched down and leaned forward.
Almost...
Almost...
No.
She couldn't reach the linchpin that held the hitch in place
without letting go of the cage.

"Maddy, don't!"
She ignored her sister's frightened cry and lunged forward.
Got it!
Holding onto the hitch with one paw,
she yanked the linchpin out with the other and threw it away.

She thought the cargo bot would just pull away smoothly
to leave the unhitched cage cart rolling along the highway behind it.
That didn't happen.
Instead,
there a loud crash as Dockety and a raider bot slammed into the side of the cage,
their manipulators grappling for holds on each other.

Maddy screamed for a third time as the cart careened off the road.
A wheel bumped over a stone,
throwing Maddy off the hitch and into a scratchy patch of brambles.
The trio inside the cart screamed in their turn as it tipped over on its side
and slid down the rocky slope toward the swamp.
Maddy scrambled to her feet and ran after it.

The cart slid to a halt just a few paces from the edge of the muck.
Rusty scraps of old machinery lay all around.
Maddy grabbed one end of a metal bar and pulled with all her might.
The bar came free of the mud with a shlurping sound.

She ran over to the cart.
Luckily,
it had landed door side up.
She tossed her bar on top of it,
scrambled up,
wedged the end of the bar in by the lock,
and levered it with all her might.
*Pank!*
The lock burst open.

"Give me your paw!" she ordered.

Her sister stretched on tiptoe.
"I can't reach!
Hey!"
One of the goats lifted her up so that Maddy could grab her wrist,
then reached up himself.

A few moments later all four of them were standing beside the cage
and Maddy had her arms wrapped around her sister.
"I was so afraid," she whispered in Sindy's ear.
"I was so afraid I'd never see you again."

Sindy sniffled.
"Me too."

"Well ain't this sweet," one of the goats muttered.
Maddy straightened up.
She knew that voice---it was Bluster,
which meant the other goat must be his brother Bravo.
Of all the people she would have wanted to rescue,
they were the last.

"Well don't be too hasty thanking me,"
she said coldly.

"We would've been aright,"
Bluster said defensively.
"Wouldn't we?"
He nudged his brother, who nodded.

Sindy took her sister's paw.
"Was that a bot helping you?" she asked.

"Don't worry about that now,"
Maddy said.
"We have to get out of here!"

"And go where?"
Bluster demanded.
"In case you hadn't noticed,
we're in the middle of the Mire."

"Yeah, but at least you're not in a cage any more.
Oh, and you're welcome,"
Maddy added sarcastically.
The goat glowered at her but didn't reply.

"What are we going to do, Maddy?" Sindy asked.
"We can't---ulp!"

Maddy covered Sindy's mouth with her hand
as the cargo bot appeared at the top of the slope.
"Don't move!" she hissed at the goats.

The cargo bot's square head pivoted from side to side as it searched for them.
Maddy held her breath.
Could it keep its balance on the loose gravel?
Maybe if it came after them it would topple over.

*And then we'd only have all the other bots to deal with,*
she finished in her head.
She wished she knew where Dockety was.
She hoped it was aright.

A long moment passed.
The cargo bot backed up and rumbled away to look for them elsewhere.
Maddy let out her breath with a whoosh.
"Come on," she ordered the others.

"Come where?" Bluster demanded.

Maddy gave him a cold look.
"Anywhere that isn't here.
But if you two want to stay, go ahead.
Come on, Sindy."
She took her sister's hand and started walking.
A moment later the grumbling goats followed them.

*Shlurp shlurp shlurp...*
At first Maddy tried to pick her way from rock to rock,
but her feet were soaked and muddy after just a few dozen steps
so she gave up and just trudged in as straight a line as she could,
which wasn't very straight.
The river was wide and shallow in the Mire,
and any three people would have had four different opinions
about where its bank actually was,
or whether indeed it had one.
The smell of damp vegetation was almost overpowering.
A sharp chemical tang came and went,
reminding Maddy of the turpentine she used to clean her paintbrushes
or the greasy black poison her mother sponged onto the porch every spring
to keep the termites away.
If they got back to Rusty Bridge,
she was going to take the longest, soapiest bath of her entire life.

They stopped twice when they heard motors revving in the distance,
crouching behind whatever cover they could find until the sound faded.
All of a sudden they found themselves among trees,
fingerling willows no taller than they were
and then larger ones whose branches bent in elegant sad arcs.
Some of their leaves shimmered metallically,
almost too faintly to be seen.
The foursome steered clear of those ones.

They had been walking for about half an hour
when a patch of bark slipped off a fallen tree
as Bravo was clambering over it.
His foot slid out from under him.
"Whoa!"
His legs went one way and his body went the other.
He landed awkwardly on the tree and rolled off onto the ground.

"Y'aright?" his brother asked,
helping him up.

Bravo shook him off,
then swore as he tried to take a step.
"My ankle," he grunted.
"I think I twisted it."

"Idiot."
Bluster punched him in the shoulder.
"Why'd you go and do that?"

Bravo punched him back, harder.
"Stop it!" Maddy snapped.
"Let me have a look at it."

"Oh, so you're a doctor now?"
Bluster said sarcastically.

"She's smarter than you," Sindy said loyally.
"And quieter, too," she added pointedly as Bluster opened his mouth.

Maddy straightened up.
"I don't think it's sprained," she told Bravo.
"Just do the best you can, aright?"
The goat nodded.

They went more slowly after that,
Bravo leaning on Bluster and Sindy needing rest more and more frequently.
Maddy had to bite her tongue to stop herself from telling them all to hurry up.
It would take them days to get back to Rusty Bridge at this speed,
but there was nothing she could do about it
except hope that Gumption had convinced the mayor
to send people to rescue them.

A particularly squelchy patch of land
sent them in a wide arc that brought them nearer the highway
than Maddy liked.
*Just 'til we're past that tall tree,*
she promised herself.

As if it had heard her thoughts,
the tree took a long stride toward them.
A blinding-bright searchlight picked them out of the darkness,
and a familiar harsh mechanical horn blased.
It was the long-legged bot from the raid on Rusty Bridge,
and it had spotted them!

"Back to the river!" she yelled.
The soft, muddy ground was their only hope.

"Maddy!" her sister shrieked.
Drawn by the horn and the searchlight,
another bot was grinding toward them on treads,
revving an oversized chainsaw on the end of one arm.

"There's another one on the river!" Bluster shouted
with panic in his voice
as the searchlight swept across something
that looked like a flatboat with a bucket for a head.
It was an ambush,
Maddy realized,
and now they were caught with nowhere to run
as the three bots closed in.

"Get into those trees!" she ordered Bluster and Bravo.
They wouldn't stop the bots,
or even slow them down for more than a few seconds,
but it was all she could think of.

*Zzzrrr!*
The sawbot swung its whizzing arm at them,
trying to drive them back into the open.
Bravo pulled a clump of mud out of the ground and threw it at the bot.
It splatted uselessly on its rust-stained torso.

*Zzzrrr!*
The chainsaw swung again as the long-legged bot with the searchlight
tried to grab Sindy with one of its elongated arms.
"Get away!" she shouted angrily,
scooping up some mud and flinging it.

*Splat!*
The mud hit the searchlight,
throwing them briefly back into darkness.

*Zzzrrrmmm!*
The chainsaw bot's arm hit a branch of one of the willow trees.

*Snap!*
The branch fell to the ground
right where the long-legged bot was taking its next step.
It staggered drunkenly,
windmilling its arms just a person as it tried to regain its balance.

*Shlurp!*
One of its feet landed in a muddy sinkhole.
Its horn blared as it toppled over
and fellright on the boatbot's head
with a sound like an empty can being crunched underfoot.

"Go!" Maddy shouted.
"Into the boat!"

The goats didn't need to be told twice.
Bluster pelted across the mud and threw himself onto the boat
as the long-legged bot rolled off it into the river.
"Come on!" he yelled at his twin brother
as Bravo ran-hopped, ran-hopped, and grabbed Bluster's outstretched hand.

But Maddy and Sindy were too slow.
The chainsaw bot blocked their way,
its arm whizzing angrily.

And then something rocketed out of nowhere
and bounced into the air
and slammed into the sawbot at just the right spot.
The sawbot tipped and tilted and fell on its side,
its heavy treads throwing mud and muck into the air
as it tried vainly to right itself.

"Dockety!" Maddy exclaimed.

Their rescuer got back to its feet.
"Are you intact?" it asked
as it scraped mud off its wheel
and flicked it onto the sawbot.

"We're fine.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!"

"But Maddy---the boat!"
Sindy pulled on her sleeve.

Maddy spun around.
Her heart sank.
The two goats were drifting away on the current.

"Turn around!" she yelled.
"Please! Come back!"

"I don't know how!"
Bluster shouted back to her.
"But we'll get help!"

Moments later they vanished into the night,
leaving the two young roos alone in the Mire
with a dented bot for company
and no idea how they would get home.

## Chapter 7: ...And Into the Mire

"Thank you for saving us,"
Maddy said to Dockety.
"They would have had us for sure."

"Theze onez were *click*,"
the bot replied sadly.
"Thiz one regretz ending them."

"You did the right thing,"
Sindy ventured.
"They were being bad."

"They did not have a choize.
Botz do not have choizez when regulatorz are put on them.
*Regulatorz* are bad."
Its heavy claw clicked twice
in what Maddy now realized was the equivalent of an angry scowl.

The river gurgled quietly beside them as they stood for a moment without speaking.
Moonlight gleamed through a break in the clouds.
"More botz will come," Dockety finally said.
"We should not be here when they do."
Something scraped and creaked as it took a step.

"Wait---you're hurt!"
Maddy exclaimed
as the moonlight fell on a dent in the bot's side.
It had hit the sawbot so hard that two of its torso plates had bent inward,
leaving a gap like a wound.

"Thiz one cannot feel hurt.
But it doez buzz a little,"
the bot admitted.

"Wait!"
Sindy searched the ground.
"Just wait!" she repeated impatiently as Maddy opened her mouth.
"There!"
She scooped a piece of metal off the ground and held it out to Dockety.
"Will this help?"

The bot took it from her.
Its lasers flashed green as it scanned the curved place.
"It zhould be zuffizient," it acknowledged.
With no more ceremony than that it unscrewed the bent plates,
tossed them aside,
and fastened the salvaged piece of metal in their place.

*Eww*, Maddy thought,
feeling slightly queasy at the impromptu surgery,
but Dockety's lenses rotated.
"That is better," it pronounced,
its voice back to normal.

Maddy nudged her sister with her shoulder.
"That was lucky."

Sindy shrugged.
"I guess,
but I don't *feel* very lucky."
Even as she spoke something hooted in the distance.
"How are we going to get *home*, Maddy?"

"I don't know,"
Maddy said helplessly.

The hoot came again.
Another answered it.
"There are worse things here than Lasercase,"
Dockety said darkly.
"We must go."

And so they set off again.
Dockety took the lead,
scanning the ground with its lasers
and occasionally waving them around sinkholes or gloopy bubbling bits of especially swampy ground.
Maddy brought up the rear
so that she could be sure Sindy didn't fall behind.
She tried humming a tune for a while,
the way their mother did when they were on a long walk,
but it just made the bent trees around them seem more ominous.

*Sploosh.*
Maddy whirled around.
"What was that?" she whispered loudly.

"Processing."
Dockety's lenses rotated.
"Unknown,
but judging from the volume---"

*Sploosh.*
"Judging from the volume,
and the fact that the frogs have all stopped burping,
it is probably both large and dangerous.
We should adjust course."

They picked their way carefully toward higher ground.
It brought them closer to the highway,
but Maddy decided wearily that she was less afraid of Lasercase and the other bots
than she was of something that could survive in the polluted river.

"I'm hungry," Sindy complained.

Well, I'm---"
Maddy stopped herself.
There was no point snapping at her little sister.
"I'm hungry too," she continued gently,
putting her arm around Sindy's shoulders and giving her a squeeze.
"And scared.
I bet Mama's scared too.
Oops!
Sorry!"

Dockety had stopped so abruptly that Maddie walked right into him.
Its lasers danced across the ground.
"There is a path here," it said.
"Processing.
It is not in the database."

"Does it go up to the highway?" Maddy asked.

"Negative."
Dockety pointed.
"It goes there."

For a moment Maddy couldn't see what the bot was pointing at.
Then she realized that the mound in front of them was too regular to be natural.
The spring floods had washed away enough dirt to reveal part of a concrete bunker.
Most of it was still covered in mud and stunted grasses,
but one entire side now lay revealed by the moonlight.

She swallowed,
her fatigue and hunger momentarily forgotten.
There was a door in the bunker's side,
a door as thick as her hand could spread wide,
and it was open.

Sindy took Maddy's hand.
"It looks scary,"
she whispered.

Maddy nodded.
She was about to say they would go around
when she heard another *sploosh* in the river twenty meters away.
"Do you think it's safe?" she asked Dockety.

The bot's lenses rotated.
"Unknown.
Its absence from this one's database is puzzling."

Maddy took a deep breath and let it out.
"Well,
if you don't know about it
then maybe your friends don't either.
Come on."

She started down the path.
Sindy pulled her back.
"Maddy!
It's *scary*.
It looks like it has spiders."

She put her arm around her little sister's shoulders.
"We have to sleep somewhere,"
she said into the warm fur on top of Sindy's head.
"And if there are spiders,
Dockety can squish them for us.
All right?"

The bunker didn't look any less scary as they got closer to it.
In fact,
by the time they reached the door
Maddy was wondering about spiders as well.
Would hiding in a patch of trees really be that---

*Sploosh.*
"Right," she muttered.
She was about to slip through the door when Dockety put a manipulator on her arm.

"This one will go first," it said.
Reaching up to its chest,
it slid a small panel to one side to reveal a circle of glass.
It brightened and then dimmed.
Dockety tapped it with a metal finger.
It brightened once again and steadied,
casting a soft white light on the ground in front of them.

The door was open just wide enough for the bot to squeeze through.
Maddy and Sindy waited outside,
hearts pounding,
until they heard it say,
"It appears unoccupied."
Maddy shooed her sister through and then followed.

They found themselves in an empty room.
The floor was blanketed with dried mud and blown leaves.
The walls and roof were bare concrete blocks.
Dockety turned to shine its flashlight on a rust-streaked sign
fastened opposite the door that said
"Emergency Defenses Control Station".
A broken screen stood on a pedestal beneath it,
and next to both was another door,
this one closed tight.

"See?" Maddy said much more bravely than she felt.
"No spiders."
Sindy nodded but didn't reply.

The older roo picked a spot where the leaves seemed driest
and sat down gingerly.
"We have to sleep for a while,"
she told the bot
as Sindy stretched out beside her and put her head in Maddy's lap.
"Can you wake us when the sun comes up and we'll get moving again?"

"Confirmed.
This one will reduce operational status as well."
The bot's flashlight started to dim.

"Wait---can you..."
Maddy asked.

"Of course."
The light steadied,
not as bright as before but still comforting.
Maddy closed her eyes and was instantly as lost to the world
as her gently snoring sister.

She woke a few moments or an hour later.
Her head felt like it was stuffed with dirty laundry,
and her tongue tasted like---she didn't want to think what it tasted like.
She rubbed her eyes.
What had woken her?

As if in answer,
something rustled outside the door.
She held her breath,
hoping it was just the wind or a stray frog,
but then she heard it again.

Moving slowly,
she picked a pebble out of the muddy floor beside her
and tossed it at Dockety.
*Clink.*
"Hey," she whispered urgently.
"Are you awake?"

The bot's flashlight brightened slightly.
Its green lasers flashed on and swept across the room.
"Returning to normal operating status,"
it said.

"Ssh! Quiet! Something's out there!"
Maddy put a hand over Sindy's mouth as her sister stirred.
"Listen!"

Nothing... nothing...
*Rustle.*
A long mechanical tentacle slid through the door like a snake,
bits of river weed still clinging to it in places.

"Mmph?"
Sindy struggled in Maddy's lap.

"Ssh ssh ssh," Maddy breathed in her sister's ear.
"Quiet. Be quiet. And don't... move..."

The tentacle curled to the left,
sweeping through the leaves toward the wall.
Dockety waited until it almost touched him,
then stepped over it.

The tentacle began curling the other way.
As Dockety stepped over it again,
Maddy got to her feet as quietly as she could
and pulled Sindy up beside her.
Before Maddy could stop her,
Sindy grabbed hold of one of the levers sticking out of the wall to steady herself.

The lever dropped with a loud *clack*.
Maddy had only a heartbeat to duck and pull Sindy down with her
as the tentacle lifted off the ground and struck the wall.
*Smack!*
The tentacle whipped back and hit the wall again.

On the wall opposite the door they'd come through,
the second door began to grind open.
"Go!" Maddy ordered Sindy.

"But---"

"Go!"
She pushed her sister forward.
She had no idea what lay deeper in the bunker,
but it couldn't be worse than this.

"But I *can't*!" Sindy wailed.
"It's not open enough!"
She grabbed the edge of the door and pulled as hard as she could.
It scraped open another few millimeters before wedging in the muck below them.

"Help her!" Maddy shouted at Dockety.
Without waiting to see what the bot did
she grabbed a handful of mud and threw it at the tentacle.
"Hah! Whoa!"
She ducked and rolled under it,
then rolled again as it slapped the ground.

Dockety took hold of the inner door with its claw manipulator,
placed one metal foot on the wall,
and shoved.
The door scraped open another few millimeters.

"Keep going!"
Maddy threw dry leaves at the tentacle
and jumped as it swept across the floor again.

*Scrape.*
"It's open!" Sindy shouted.
She squeezed through.

*Scrape.*
Dockety gave one last push.
"Make haste," it said.

Maddy didn't need any more encouragement than that.
She sprinted five steps across the room
as the bot followed her sister into whatever lay behind the door.
Just as she reached it,
something cold and mechanical grabbed hold of her ankle.

## Chapter 8: Underground

Maddy screamed.
She tried to pull her leg free,
bu the tentacle's grip was iron-strong.
"Help! Help!"
She flung handfuls of dirt and dead leaves at it
as it dragged her across the floor.

Dockety scraped through the door behind her
and flung itself at the tentacle.
"Release! Release!" it rasped
as it grabbed the loop around Maddy's leg
and tried to pry it loose.

Maddy kicked and pulled,
but couldn't get her ankle free.
"Release! Imperative! Release!"
Dockety hit the tentacle with its heavy manipulator,
then grabbed it again,
all to no avail.

"Maddy!"
Sindy squeezed through the rear door and ran to her sister.
She put her hands under Maddy's armpits
and pulled until her feet slipped out from under her.
"Get off her!" she shrieked.

Suddenly Maddy had an idea.
She doubled over and fumbled with her bootlace,
cursing herself for having tied it so well.
The braided string was clagged with mud,
and so damp that it might as well have been dipped in glue.
"Come on come on come on," she muttered frantically.
There!
Her fingernail finally found purchase.
She pulled one end loose and hastily undid the rest of the knot.

"Pull!" she yelled at Dockety.
As the bot hauled back on the tentacle,
Maddy braced the heel of her other boot against it and yanked her trapped foot free.
She was out!

She scrambled to her feet
just as the tentacle realized its prey had somehow escaped.
It threw the boot across the foot and lashed out,
trying to find her again.

*Clunk!*
The boot hit one of the levers in the wall.
Rumbling and grinding,
the door to the outside began to close.

The tentacle lashed out again,
then began to slither back so that it would be cut in half.
"Go!" Maddy ordered Sindy.
With Dockety right behind them,
they squeezed through the rear door.

Maddy found herself on a small platform at the top of
a flight of broad concrete stairs.
Even with Dockety's chest light at its brightest,
they couldn't see how far the steps went.
"Did you go down?" she asked Sindy,
her voice hushed.

Her sister shook her head.
"We were waiting for you."
And then she flung her arms around Maddy and gave her a hug.
"I was scared."

Maddy hugged her back.
"I was scared too."
She sniffled.
"But remember what Mama always says.
If you can't give up, you have to keep going.
Come on."

She took her sister's hand,
and was only mildly surprised when Dockety took her other hand
with its smaller manipulator.
Side by side,
they descended into the unknown.

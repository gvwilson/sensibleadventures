## Chapter 1: Salvage

Maddy was trying to sketch the willlow tree in the center of the village square
when Gumption showed up with a couple of books under his arm.
She had spent the whole morning and most of the afternoon doing chores around the house,
mostly to avoid having to look after her little sister.
She hadn't exactly sneaked out of the house,
but she hadn't told her mother she was leaving either.

"Heya," Gumption said breathlessly as he plopped himself down on the stone bench beside her.
"How's it going?"

"Aright," she said without looking up.
The willow tree had defeated her once before.
She was determined to capture its drooping green branches in her notebook,
but somehow the lines she drew didn't quite capture the willow's melancholy curves
the way the pictures in Shaper Leaf's books did.

She closed her sketchbook with a sigh.
Gumption had a fresh food stain on his shirt, she noticed,
and if he had combed his brown-and-white fur that morning,
someone or something had carefully uncombed it since.
She nodded at the small pile of books he had set down between them.
"What did you think?"

The goat boy shrugged.
"They were aright. A lot of... you know."
He rolled his eyes in a way that meant
"too much romance, not enough last-second escapes from villainous bots".

"Yeah," Maddy agreed.
She stood up and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the worn canvas satchel her father had made for her.
"Come on---let's see if he has anything new."

Once upon a time,
the village of Rusty Bridge had consisted of a single rectangle of two-story buildings
around a central square.
All of those buildings' doors and windows had faced the square:
the outer walls had been blank and double-thick
to keep their occupants safe against rogue bots and roving bandits.
Over the years,
though,
a second ring of houses had slowly grown up around the first,
smaller and less well ordered.
One of these belonged to Shaper Leaf,
the only turtle within a hundred kays and the village's oldest resident by far.

Maddy would never forget the first time her mother and father took her to the shaper's house.
"Don't be afraid," they comforted her,
not realizing that she hadn't been until they said that.
But when Shaper Leaf opened his front door and smiled at them
and she saw the books stacked on his shelves,
her nervousness vanished.

"Are they *real*?" she asked in wonder.

The old turtle chuckled.
"As real as you are.
Here."
He ushered her in,
took a tattered picture book from its place,
and handed it to her.
"Would you like to borrow this one? Or how about these two?"
She walked out of the shaper's house with an armload of books and stars in her eyes,
then sat down on his porch and started to read the first one
while her parents vainly tried to persuade the old turtle to take a jar of home-made jam as a thank-you.

Gumption had shown up a few months later.
His family hadn't brought him---the village goats weren't bookish people---and
at first Maddy had resented this intruder into her magical world of stories and long-ago science.
But they started talking one day and hadn't stopped since,
and now they swapped their borrowed books back and forth
so that they at least had someone to roll their eyes with over the mushy bits.

Shaper Leaf's house smelled like old sweaters and fresh cabbage and mystery,
and if Maddy closed her eyes she could almost imagine that her father was there with her.
The old turtle was snoring in his battered old rocking chair when they arrived,
so they placed their books quietly on the table beside him
and picked two more each from the shelves behind him.
Maddy glowered at Gumption when he pointed at the top shelf
the shaper said they weren't old enough to read yet.
"Kidding," he mouthed silently.
Maddy swished her tail in annoyance and shooed him outside.

Her heart sank as soon as she stepped through the door.
Her sister Sindy was sitting on the porch
tangling and untangling a piece of string around her fingers.
"Where did you *go*?" she asked,
bouncing to her feet.
"Mamma said I could play with you but you weren't *there*!
Heya, Gumption!"
she finished brightly.

"Heya," Gumption grunted,
very carefully *not* looking at Maddy,
whose glower was back and twice as glowery.

"Does mamma know you're here?" Maddy demanded.

Sindy bounced up and down a couple of times.
"Not exactly," she admitted.
"But she said I could play with you and you weren't home
so the only way I could do that was to come and find you
and I figured this would be the best place to look and---"

"Stop!" Maddy snapped.
"We're both going to be in trouble if mamma thinks I let you wander off.
Let's just go home and hope she doesn't notice."

The younger roo's ears drooped.
"I just wanted to play," she said plaintively.

"You always 'just want'," Maddy said under her breath.
As she fumbled with the tie string on her satchel
her books slipped out from under her arm and thudded onto the porch.

She sighed heavily.
"Now look what you made me do.
No, it's aright, I've got them."
She shooed Gumption away
then picked up the books,
brushed them off,
and tucked them into her bag.
"Come on, you."

The trio walked back to the village square without speaking.
A few grownups nodded or said hello as they passed.
Maddy nodded back,
but was too busy staying angry to do any more than that.
It was two years since her father had been taken by bots.
She had helped her mother every day since then:
cleaning the house,
mixing paint for portraits and signs,
and most of all,
looking after her little sister.
Every time her mother said, "I'm sorry you've had to grow up so fast,"
Maddy told her she didn't mind,
and she *didn't*,
she really didn't,
but the one afternoon each week when she got to practice sketching
and talk about books with Gumption was special,
and it wasn't fair of Sindy to---

"Hey," Gumption said, elbowing her.
Maddy blinked.
They had passed through the houses on the other side of the square
and reached the smaller square that people *didn't* pass time in.
An ageless black glass pillar stood in its center,
half again taller than any person Maddy knew.
Moss didn't grow on it
and birds never landed on it.
Gumption said his uncle had touched it once on a dare
and got a shock so strong it made his whole arm tingle.
Maddy had never tried to sketch it---whenever she walked past,
it felt like something or someone was watching her,
and even if she knew how to capture that in a drawing,
she didn't want to.

But the pillar wasn't the only thing in the square.
Bluster and Bravo Gruff were sitting on the waist-high stone wall that surrounded the pillar
pitching pebbles at it with bored expressions on their faces.
For a heartbeat Maddy thought they would be able to hurry by unnoticed,
but then Bluster caught sight of them and nudged his twin brother.

Maddy took her sister's hand.
"You just stay hushed," she cautioned quietly,
squeezing to show she meant it.
She hitched her satchel up onto her shoulder with her other hand
and tried to ignore the dryness in her mouth.

"Heya, roo," Bluster drawled as he and his brother sauntered over.
"Whatcha got in yer pouch?"

"Books," Maddy said curtly.
"And it's not a pouch, it's a satchel."

"I wasn't asking about your bag," Bluster said,
stepping into her path.
"I was asking about your *pouch*."
He rubbed his belly and grinned wickedly.
"Gummy put anything in there yet?"

"Eat glue," Gumption said hotly,
his hands balling into fists.

"Why don't you make me?" Bluster replied,
his just-kidding tone gone as quickly as it had appeared.

"Yeah, make him,"
his brother Bravo said,
cracking his knuckles.

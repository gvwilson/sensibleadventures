## Scenes

**Need more plot without more characters if I'm going to make 60K.**

1.  [plot development / day 1] Noxy and others are picking spider
    webs; describe the village and its surroundings, including the
    cloud pen; they are interrupted by a troll (standoff as both are
    frightened of the other); troll is scared away by Young Gas who
    says there are soldiers in the village; Thokmay, Kulbinder, Dorbu,
    and a few others arrive, exhausted by their attempt to scout a way
    through the forest.  Foreshadow that Noxy can mind-hear clouds
    from a distance, but she hasn't realized it: she just knows
    something's wrong (Pillow and Big Blue are agitated).  Some of the
    soldiers were cut off by a landslide and need rescue - "the forest
    really doesn't want to let them through".  And the trolls have
    been harassing them - "the forest's servants".

2.  [danger / day 1] Most of the adults are away rounding up clouds;
    Noxy begs to be allowed to come along, Indy's first reaction is
    'no', but Granna Fee points out the youngers need to learn how to
    do a rescue, so they get to go.  Noxy, Sensy, and Rash are with
    Grappa Gas while Aft and Indy take the other cloud to do the
    actual rescue.  Turns out to be more soldiers than Dorbu had let
    on, so they need to use both clouds; Noxy's tension unsettles Big
    Blue, so Aft accidentally scrapes against a mountain, causing a
    snowslide, but the soldiers are rescued.

3.  [conflict / day 1] People coming to Indy's one by one for tea -
    get some of the background to the rebellion, get to know the
    villagers and their dynamics.  Discussion is interrupted by
    commotion outside as Kulbinder chases a troll over the rooftops.
    (Trolls are Gifted chimpanzees - Kulbinder uses the word.)  He
    thinks it might be a spy; the Stalers know it's just from the
    local troop.  (Noxy makes a bad Joke here about "troop of trolls"
    and "troop of soldiers".)  Stalers don't want the trolls hurt,
    since that will just cause trouble - Indy says she'll talk to the
    troop's alpha (sighing, yet another job).

4.  [conflict + romance + mystery / day 2] Thokmay is given the
    morning off by Kulbinder; plays snakes and whistles with the other
    children; see Sensy and Rash rebelling against Noxy's bossiness
    while the junior love triangle play out.  When Thokmay loses to
    Rash, Noxy says, "You're not as good at this game as you thought,"
    and Thokmay replies, "It depends what game you think I'm playing."
    Then we see Rash and Sensy becoming Thokmay's friends, and realize
    he lost on purpose.  Noxy asks about Thokmay's scars (in order to
    be nasty); Thokmay woodenly says that he got them for trying to
    desert. When Noxy asks Thokmay, "Is he yours?"  the answer is a
    cool, "No, I'm his".

5.  [danger + character development / day 2] Grappa Gas is excited
    about the fish pond; Kulbinder maneuvers him into giving Thokmay a
    ride to look at it; Noxy overhears discussion between Thokmay and
    Kulbinder revealing the purpose is to see if they can get away
    like this, which she can't square with Thokmay having tried to
    desert.  Still annoyed, Noxy imagines Thokmay faillng into the
    pond and is horrified when Pillow actually does it.  Dorbu rescues
    him (cloudherds don't know how to swim).  Kulbinder says "Your
    Highness!" but Noxy is the only one who hears.  Noxy realizes
    she's acting badly because she's jealous, and apologizes to Granna
    Fee, who tells her it's Thokmay she should apologize to (but she
    doesn't want to).

6.  [danger / day 2] A mountain storm closes in: "the forest is
    sending its lightnings to remind us not to walk it" so that we
    understand the forest controls the lightning.  See Dorbu and Indy
    taking an interest in each other over dinner, and learn that
    Noxy's father is "lost".  (Thokmay is there for dinner with
    Kulbinder, both because Kulbinder is an honored member of the unit
    and as Indy's way of apologizing for the dunking.)  We learn that
    Dorbu's family lost their farm because they couldn't afford to
    rent the law that would have saved it; Dorbu joined Shudarga's
    rebellion to stop that happening to other people.  Indy is
    pessimistic: people with power will always find a way to use it
    unfairly.

7.  [mystery / day 3] Stale wakes to after-storm quiet.  Noxy sees
    some footprints in the mud, follows them, sees Thokmay hiding some
    stolen food and blankets in the forest.  She is about to confront
    him when Kulbinder appears out of the woods (she's glad she's
    downwind).  She can't hear what they're saying, but Kulbinder
    clearly knows what's going on.  She goes back to tell Indy, but
    her mother scolds her for not doing her chores, so she keeps her
    discovery secret out of petulance.  As she is peeling parsnips for
    roasting, she begins to mind-hear the clouds.  Frightened, she
    diffidently asks Granna Fee about it (saying, "one of the soldiers
    was wondering," which gives Granna Fee a chance to say, "Oh, are
    you sweet on one too?").  With relish, Granna Fee tells her that
    it sometimes happens, but the cloudherds who can do it go mad
    because they can't shut out the noise.  As she says that, they
    hear shouting by the main gate.

8.  [fight / day 3] Several of Dorbu's soldiers were on patrol when
    they surprised a loyalist patrol.  They drove some off and
    captured two, but as they get back to Stale, one of the two
    escapes.  Chase, fight, etc.; Aft trips a Canary to help the
    loyalist get away, but he's cornered eventually.  Dorbu talks him
    into surrendering; as he's led away, he tells Aft coldly that he
    can be on whatever side he wants, but if he ever endangers a
    Canary again, he'll answer for it.

9.  [character development + romance / day 3] Noxy finds her friends
    on the walls watching the clouds, speculating about who'd win a
    fight between the soldiers and the Stalers; Sensy and Aft go for
    walk together, leaving Noxy feeling as lonely as Thokmay.  Noxy
    finds Thokmay on the walls as well with some sticks.  Trying to
    make conversation, she asks him what he's doing.  He talks about
    making kites with his sister, and Noxy realizes how lonely he
    is. She says she's sorry he was dunked in the pond (without
    admitting she did it).  Later, though, she sees him and Kulbinder
    walking past the hut where the two prisoners are being kept;
    Thokmay keeps a lookout while Kulbinder talks to the prisoners
    (but Noxy can't hear).  Before Noxy can tell her mother, she gets
    a twinge - a cloud is coming.

10. [plot development / day 3] Princess Shudarga arrives on a cloud
    flown by Tasteless with a handful of bodyguards, while Bonzon
    arrives on foot with a couple of dozen soldiers (who are much
    scarier than Dorbu's).  Unlike Dorbu's troops, Shudarga's are
    hardened, and command rather than cajole.  The patrol that Dorbu's
    men surprised was hunting for Shudarga, who is in full retreat.
    Her army can't escape because the forest won't let them through.
    (Grappa Gas says that forests are like him: they like things the
    way they are.)  Shudarga's makes a set-piece speech explaining the
    rebellion - she's sincere about making the world better, but still
    thinks like nobility when it comes to breaking commoner eggs.
    (Happens when she announces that the rebels are going to take the
    clouds the Stalers are rounding up in order to ferry the army to
    Chaghan - Indy says, "But without those clouds, no crops in Gandan
    - people will go hungry," to which Shudarga replies, "People are
    already going hungry.")  Indy confronts Dorbu, believing the whole
    thing has been a set-up; he protests that it wasn't, and we see
    that while he believes in the cause, he's uncomfortable with the
    methods.

11. [mystery / day 4] Thokmay has stayed out of the way since Shudarga
    arrived, but Noxy catches him stealing a small dayglass lantern.
    She feels betrayed, and says she's going to tell her mother - "Or
    maybe the princess or that captain of hers" - at which point
    Kulbinder pounces on her.  Thokmay reveals he's a prince; Shudarga
    will know his face, so he needs to escape.  He tries the "enemy of
    my enemy" argument (if you don't like the rebels, you must be a
    loyalist) and Noxy tells him scornfully it's not like that: she
    can be against both sides.  Kulbinder knew that the forest would
    stop them going through to Chaghan - has been trying to delay so
    that loyalist forces can catch up and rescue Thokmay.  Before Noxy
    can decide what to do, Young Gas stumbles in, sees Noxy pinned,
    and goes yelling for help.

12. [chase / day 4] Noxy, Thokmay, and Kulbinder are dragged in front
    of Captain Bonzon.  Shudarga recognizes Thokmay, so they have to
    run (leaving behind the stuff he has cached).  Their flight is a
    recap of the loyalist soldier running through Stale the day
    before.  Noxy calls Big Blue from a distance: she, Thokmay, and
    Kulbinder run at a cliff's edge and jumping onto it to escape.

13. [danger / day 4] As the threesome argue about what to do, another
    storm comes up.  They are lashed by rain and threatened by
    lightning, which makes the cloud very skittish.  Noxy eventually
    decides to go and find Ulfmaerr to get help.  She leads them to
    his old home, but he is gone.  They decide to spend the night, but
    are attacked by mountain trolls and forced to flee.

14. [fight / day 5] Noxy is exhausted by the time the sun comes up.
    They begin arguing again about what to do, but then Tasteless
    finds them.  There is a cloud fight; Noxy slows him down by
    mind-speaking confusion to Tasteless's cloud, but loses
    concentration when Tasteless tells Noxy that Aft tried to stop the
    rebels from going after the prince, and was beaten badly for it.
    Dorbu reluctantly confirms this, and says that if Noxy doesn't
    come back, Granna Fee will be next.  Noxy is about to give in when
    birds start flying around them - they've found Ulfmaerr.

15. [plot development + heartbreak / day 5] Ulfmaerr drives off
    Tasteless.  Noxy and the others land.  They talk to Ulfmaerr, who
    lives in a new cave (an old spell price prevents him sleeping in
    the same home twice - if he lives somewhere long enough, it
    becomes a home).  He cured a plague of scribbles that came through
    the mountains years ago by giving up his ability to remember the
    people he loves.  (He has inky scars like writing on his arms from
    being infected himself.)  Flashback to Noxy remembering him caring
    for her, and an explanation of how magic works.  Thokmay asks
    about Noxy's conrol of Tasteless's cloud; Noxy explains what she's
    afraid of.  Noxy falls asleep hearing Tasteless's cloud in the
    distance.

16. [conflict + fight / day 5] Kulbinder wakes Noxy to say that
    soldiers are coming - Tasteless must have ferried them in.  Dorbu
    gets to the cave first and tries to persuade Thokmay to give
    himself up; Thokmay says he won't be a prisoner, and won't be used
    against his father.  Bonzon appears as they're talking and says,
    "You'll be used as we'll use you!"  He captures Thokmay and is
    going to hamstring him to stop him running away; Kulbinder can't
    intervene because he's netted.  Dorbu snaps and intervenes; Dorbu
    and Bonzon fight while Thokmay escapes with Ulfamerr's help;
    Dorbu falls to his death.

17. [conflict + awe / day 5] Arguing again about what to do, this time
    with Ulfmaerr in the mix, but Thokmay doesn't want to run for
    Gandan any more: he wants revenge for Dorbu's death, and Noxy
    wants to help her village.  Ulfmaerr says he knows a way.  They go
    ask the forest for help from the trolls.  Ulfmaerr has nothing
    left to offer the forest, but Noxy offers herself - before the
    trees can agree, Thokmay offers his rulership in exchange for
    lightning as well as the trolls.

18. [fight / day 6] The forest brews a storm so that its lightnings,
    trolls, and other creatures can attack Stale; Kulbinder goes after
    Shudarga, revealing just how much he loved Dorbu, but Bonzon
    intervenes; Bonzon and Kulbinder go over the side (Kulbinder
    survives, wounded), but Shudarga escapes on Tasteless.

19. [character development / later] See Grappa Gas caring for the
    badly-injured Aft; Indy grieving for Dorbu; Thokmay gives Noxy a
    kite and they go off to fly it together as the other villagers
    return with their clouds.

## Characters

### The Cloudherds of Stale (full name "Stale Leftovers")

* Noxy (Probably Noxious): a 13-year-old girl; protagonist; bosses
  around the other children her age; put off when they start to follow
  Thokmay instead; doesn't actually have a crush on Rash, but has
  decided that he's hers, and doesn't leave a lot of room for Sensy
  and Rash to get together.
  * Character development: realizes that other people have their own
    lives, plans, feelings, etc.

* Sensy (Burning Sensation): Noxy's best friend; also 13.  Has a crush
  on Rash, but hasn't acted on it (is a bit shy, and Noxy doesn't
  leave a lot of space).

* Rash (May Cause a Rash): a 14-year-old boy; didn't go cloudherding
  the year before because of a broken leg; interested in Sensy, but
  Noxy doesn't leave much space.

* Indy (Literally Indigestible): Noxy's mother; mayor of Stale;
  torn between her sense of duty and her desire to have a life.

* Granna Fee (Induces Fever): Indy's mother, Noxy's grandmother,
  always has advice for her daughter.
  * Also has advice for Noxy - the two of them are closer than either
    is to Indy.

* Grappa Gas (Gastric Discomfort): an old man; full of stories, argues
  constantly with his son Dis; a loyalist (partly to give him
  something to argue about with his son).
  * Excited about rebuilding Stale's fish pond; wants to believe
    the rebellion can still succeed so that he can do that.

* Aft (Disgusting Aftertaste): a grown man; Grappa Gas's father and
  Young Gas's father.  Had a crush on Indy when younger; makes no
  secret of the fact that he thinks he'd be a better mayor.  He
  supports Shudarga (mostly because his father is a loyalist), and
  feels betrayed when Shudarga shows up and acts like a conqueror.
  * Has stayed behind in Stale because there's a baby on the way.
    (Mention his wife, Weakens Eyesight, but she's not a character.)

* Young Gas (Gastric Discomfort): a little boy; Aft's son.

### Gandan-o

* Prince Thokmay: 13 years old; officially Kulbinder's servant, but
  secretly royalty in training; accidentally finds himself in a unit
  loyal to Prince Shudarga's rebellion.
  * Development: realizes that his privileges bring responsibilities.

* Kulbinder: a Gifted tiger; officially scout for the Angry Canaries,
  but secretly Thokmay's bodyguard and tutor.

* King Denpa: current ruler of Gandan; Thokmay's father (but that's a
  secret revealed only after the bad guys arrive).

### Rebels

* Prince Shudarga: rebelled to replace pay-per-law with law-for-all;
  on the right side, but ruthless.  (Calls herself "King".)

* Sergeant Dorbu: commander of the Angry Canary troop since its
  captain's death a couple of weeks before the story starts; cheerful,
  dedicated, fond of Thokmay; becomes involved with Indy; believes in
  Prince Shudarga's cause, but becoming disillusioned with her
  willingness to sacrifice others to the cause.  Eventually takes a
  stand to defend Thokmay, and is killed.
  * Background: family lost its farm because they couldn't afford to
    rent the law that would have saved it.

* Major Bonzon: commands the Ferocious Swallows troop that
  arrives with Prince Shudarga to occupy Stale.

### Others

* Ulfmaerr: a magician, originally from Vaarda; Noxy's father (but
  that's revealed gradually - he doesn't remember, because he traded
  family for magic).

* Tasteless: cloudherd pirate "captain" working with Shudarga;
  believes in wrecking things more than he believes in equality.

* Big Blue and Pillow: two clouds kept in Stale through the
  winter.

## Back Story

* Candidates for the throne spend time incognito as part of their
  training, and are then elected to rule.
  * The royal family owns the law that governs succession, so they
    get to decide who's eligible and when votes are held.

* Royalty own laws, which must be rented to be used.  It's a deeply
  unfair system, but normal in this world.
  * Include one speech by Shudarga explaining this.

* Thokmay was assigned to Dorbu's troop (the Angry Canaries) as part
  of his training; they were in the field when Prince Shudarga
  rebelled.

* Shudarga was winning when the neighboring kingdoms stepped in
  (they were afraid her rebellion would spread).

* The combined armies broke the rebellion and drove Shudarga into the
  mountains.

* Thokmay is now trapped: he can't reveal his identity without
  becoming a hostage.  Did try to sneak away once; when he was caught,
  Kulbinder pretended Thokmay had been trying to desert and scarred
  his face.
  * When Noxy asks about it (as they're getting to know each other),
    Thokmay says, "He saved my life."  Real meaning only becomes clear
    after the reveal.

* Noxy, Sensy, and Rash are supposed to cloudherd for the first time
  this summer.
  * Rash is touchy about the fact that he couldn't go last year
    because of his broken leg.
  * When the Angry Canaries arrive, most of Stale's adults are
    already on their way up to the ice fields to round up the clouds.
  * The only people left are the children, the grandparents, and a
    handful of adults.
  * So the oldest children (Noxy, Sensy, and Rash) are bossing the
    others around, Noxy more than most.
    * "You're not the mayor!" (Sensy)
    * "I will be one day!" (Noxy)

* The local laird (who ran away to the capital as soon as rebellion was
  raised) had been blocking Stale from rebuilding its fish pond
  by using a law governing the building of stone walls.
  * After he fled, Grappa Gas immediately began making plans to do the
    work.
  * Tries to talk soldiers into helping - Indy asks Dorbu whether
    there's really any point, and Dorbu's non-answer tells her that
    the rebellion is failing.

* Noxy has been having strange dreams about flying.
  * "Normal in a girl your age with your changes coming." (Granna Fee)
  * But then she mind-hears Pillow becoming agitated just before
    Tasteless arrives, and starts to wonder if she's going to go crazy.
    * There are stories about cloudherds who can mind-talk without
      touching the clouds, and they all end with the cloudherd going
      mad because she can't shut out the noise.
  * She uses this power to aid their escape on Big Blue.
    * Calls the cloud as they're running, maneuvers it into position,
      and they jump.

* Ulfmaerr is a Vaardan magician
  * Wandered into Stale years ago
    * Can't sleep under the same roof twice (not even a tent)
    * So he sleeps in caves
  * He and Indy were in love - he's Noxy's father - but he has traded
    memories of that for magic
  * He talks to the forest
    * Calls it "the real passenger on this voyage" - people are just
      stowaways
    * Indy dismisses it, but it foreshadows later events
  * Goes to the forest to trade something for its help saving
    Stale
  * He has nothing left that the forest wants
  * So Thokmay trades rulership

## What's Going On

* Adolescent love triangle: Noxy, Sensy, and Rash.
  * Rash and Sensy are interested in each other.
  * Noxy isn't really interested in Rash, but likes to be in charge,
    and is afraid that three will become two plus one.

* New kid in town: Noxy, Sensy, and Thokmay.
  * Sensy is naturally flirtatious, and Thokmay is interesting.
  * Partly to make Rash jealous, partly just to stretch her wings.
  * Thokmay isn't really interested, but has learned enough at
    court to be charming (though he's taken aback at the consequences:
    make that part funny).

* Grown-up romance: Dorbu and Indy.
  * The sergeant is naturally charming, and Indy has been focused on
    work for a long time.
  * Contrast people who know what they're doing with the awkwardness
    and boundless possibility of the children.
  * Makes Dorbu's death even more tragic.

* Loyalty vs. conscience: Shudarga, Thokmay, Dorbu, Kulbinder
  * Shudarga believes that the system is wrong, and has risked
    everything to change it.
    * Accused by loyalists like Grappa Gas of using the cause as a
      cover for her own ambition.
    * "I will stand to election like every general we've ever had,
       but everyone will vote."
  * Kulbinder: cats believe in people, not ideas.
  * Dorbu is a believer as well, but it's a practical belief rather
    than ideological.
    * Not sure things will be better (can see that the law will
      belong to who can hire the best lawyer, rather than rent the
      most useful laws - makes an analogy with mercenaries), but
      if what you're doing doesn't work, try something else.
    * Runs headlong into his belief in people (he's like Kulbinder
      in that respect)
    * When Shudarga discovers who Thokmay is, and decides to use
      him as a hostage to cover his escape by cloud to Chaghan,
      Dorbu has to make a decision.
  * Thokmay: believes in the system because that's how he's been
    raised, but stories like Grappa Gas's about not being able to
    build a fishpond because someone was using the law to squeeze
    money out of the village makes him start to doubt.
    * So does his exposure to Dorbu and his story (which Dorbu tells
      when Thokmay's response to Grappa Gas's story is, "But that's
      just one person.")
    * Thokmay's response fuels Dorbu's suspicions that Thokmay isn't
      who he appears to be.
    * Which causes a crisis for Dorbu...

* The rebellion
  * Shudarga was winning until neighboring kingdoms stepped in.
  * Believes she can find refuge in Chaghan.
    * "They like my ideas even less, but they'll do anything to poke
      a stick in Gandan's eye."
  * The pass is blocked by Gandan-o troops, so they're going to try
    to flee on cloudback.
    * Hold Stale until the cloudherds come back down from the
      ice fields, then force the villagers to take them to Chaghan.
    * Hold the children and oldish hostage.
  * This is what breaks Aft: not willing to have his children be
    hostages.
    * Caught when he tries to break Thokmay out, and punished for it.
    * At which point we see that Grappa Gas really does love him.

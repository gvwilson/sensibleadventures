# And Then

-   In the beginning...

---

-   there was a great...
-   BIG
-   BANG

-   It was so powerful that the whole universe is still expanding.
-   Satellites and telescopes can still hear its echoes...
-   ...everywhere they look.

---

-   Millions of years went by.  As the universe cooled, some of the Big Bang's energy turned into atoms.
-   Gravity pulled those atoms together...
-   ...to make giant blue stars that burned fierce and hot...

---

-   ...and then exploded...
-   ...scattering their ashes far and wide.

---

-   And then...
-   New stars formed from the ashes of the old...
-   ...smaller, cooler, and longer-lived.
-   Nine billion years after the Big Bang, a little yellow star was born on the edge of an average-looking galaxy.

---

-   As it grew brighter, the dust and gas around it clumped together to make planets...
-   ...one of which we now call "Earth".

---

-   Millions of left-over rocks still orbit the sun.  We call them "asteroids".
-   Every year, thousands of them fall from the sky as meteorites.

---

-   Four billion years ago, a small planet called Theia smashed into the Earth.
-   Most of the debris fell back to Earth.
-   Gravity pulled the rest together to make the moon.

---

-   And then...
-   The surface of the Earth cooled and formed huge plates of rock.
-   Driven by the heat of the planet's core, those plates began to move.

---

-   They only travel a few millimeters a year, but over hundreds of millions of years, they have rearranged the continents many times.

---

-   And then...
-   ...rain fell, creating the first oceans.
-   The atoms dissolved in those oceans joined together to make molecules.

---

-   Those molecules reacted with each other to create new ones.
-   Some of those reactions copied the molecules they used.
-   Life had begun.

---

-   Some scientists think that life began in shallow tidal pools warmed by the sun.

---

-   Others think it started in undersea volcanic vents.
-   But what everybody wonders is, has it ever happened anywhere else?

---

-   And then...
-   Sometimes, molecules made mistakes when copying themselves.
-   The ones that were better at copying themselves spread, only to be replaced by ones that were better still.

---

-   This never-ending process is called evolution.
-   Over hundreds of millions of years, it has created millions of new kinds of creatures.

---

-   And then...
-   The earth changed, and changed again.
-   Sometimes, meteorites crashed into it...
-   driving thousands of species to extinction.

---

-   Other times it nearly froze under a blanket of ice, or grew so hot that palm trees grew at the North Pole.
-   But life never quit, and evolution never stopped producing new kinds of creatures.

---

-   And then...
-   Ten million years ago, the world cooled again.
-   The forests of Central Africa turned into grassland.  Some species went extinct, but others adapted.
-   One began walking on two legs instead of four.

---

-   Its brain grew larger, its hands grew clever, and its grunts and screeches became language.
-   A million years and thousands of small changes later, their great-great-and-so-on grandchildren became the first human beings.

---

-   And then...
-   fire and clothing...
-   crops and herds...
-   buildings and the wheel...
-   cities, laws, and armies...
-   We invented religion, mathematics, poetry, and a thousand other things.

---

-   And all the while, we trid to figure out how the world around us worked.

---

-   And then...
-   500 years ago, we realized that if we asked our questions carefully...
-   ...and tested our ideas with experiments...
-   ...the universe would give us answers.

---

-   Modern science had begun.
-   It let us feed people...
-   ...and cure diseases...
-   ...but it also let us pollute the air, land, and water.

---

-   And then...
-   We discovered that our pollution is changing the climate all over the world.

---

-   Glaciers and ice caps are melting, thousands of species are on the edge of extinction...
-   ...and hundreds of millions of people face drought, flooding, and starvation.

---

-   And then...
-   You learned how our world came to be...
-   ...that we can use science to ask the world questions...
-   ...and that you can ask those questions too.

---

-   You learned that if we have the power to ruin this planet...
-   ...we have the power to save it, too.

---

-   You learned that we can do what' easy today...
-   ...or have a livable world tomorrow.

---

-   And then?

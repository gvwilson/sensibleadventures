*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight thousand
gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to west.  Its single
continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean whose outer shore, the
Worldrim, rises up to cradle that sweet speck of life as a child might cup a
drop of water in her hand.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well.
Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a war that scarred the moon and
turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass.  When it was over the Pilots were
gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it could.*

*Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the
endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms.  it is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot,
1272, and a girl who is no longer a child but not quite yet a woman is crouched
on a cloud, chilled to the bone and desperately hoping that they're not too
late...*

"Hold on!" Grappa Gas bellowed as they went into a dive.  "It's going to get
bumpy!"

Noxy dropped to one knee, pulled the glove off her left hand, and pressed her
palm against the cloud beneath her.  She could mind-hear Big Blue's
determination, but the cloud was old, older even than Grappa Gas, and they were
flying straight into a headwind.

*Faster!* she urged.  *Please, faster!* She shivered despite her camelskin hat
and coat, her hand already numbed by the icy mountain air.

Beside her, the tiger snarled as the last of the crows that had attacked them
swirled overhead.  One dove at his head.  He reared up and swiped at it with one
paw, cursing in Thindi as the black bird snapped its wings open and let the wind
throw it sideways just an instant before the tiger's claws would have torn it
apart.

Up ahead, a makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose like an
island out of the forest.  A dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire.
Shading her eyes with her right hand, Noxy saw that the soldiers had formed a
circle around it.  Their kilts and sturdy boots were travel-stained, and their
battle masks and lacquered leather armor were scarred from fighting.  Some had
swords in their hands, while others held spears or bows.  Big Blue's mate Pillow
floated above them, her sides rippling as she struggled to keep station in the
wind, but the soldiers only spared an occasional pleading glance for the two
clouds.  They were looking at the trees around them, waiting for the forest to
attack again.

"You're coming in too low!" Granna Fee yelled.  Noxy's grandmother lay full
length on Big Blue, propped up on her elbows with a pair of binoculars in her
hands.  "Level him off!"

"There's no time!" Grappa Gas yelled back, his red-and-yellow scarf flapping
madly behind him.  "We're going to have to bump and scrape!"  The old man closed
his eyes.  His lips moved as he mind-spoke commands to the cloud beneath him.
Noxy mind-heard the old bull protest, but even as he grumbled he bunched up and
went into a steep dive.

Noxy had just a moment to think, *I'd be grounded for a __month__ if I even
__thought__ about doing something like this,* and then the cloud thudded against
the side of the peak like a sack full of wet wool.  Nox yelped and sprawled
forward to land in an untidy heap beside Granna Fee.  "Sorry!" she said, but her
grandmother was already up, swaying to keep her balance as the cloud scraped
across bare rock, flattened two tents, and came to a halt.

The tiger bounded off with a roar.  "What are you waiting for!?" Granna Fee
shouted at the soldiers, sliding down Big Blue's flank and waving her arm as if
to sweep them all onto the cloud.  "Get on! Get on!"

As Noxy scrambled to her feet, Grappa Gas caught her arm.  "I'll help 'em up.
You stay here and keep Blue together."  Without waiting for her to answer he
stumped forward, his peg leg leaving dimples in the cloud.  "And keep an eye out
for squirrels!" he added over his shoulder.

Noxy glanced back just in time to see something big and brown swing between two
trees below them.  Another hairy shape followed it, then another, and suddenly
the trees were full of them, hooting and shaking the branches.

"Grappa!  Grappa, there's trolls!" she shouted.

"I see 'em!" the old man shouted back.

"And a bear!" Noxy added as a brown bear charged out of the trees and reared up
on its hind legs with a roar.  The muscles under its thick fur bunched as it
dropped back to all fours to charge forward a few steps, halt, and roar again.

"'Course there's a bear," Grappa Gas grunted as he clasped hands with the
nearest soldier and helped him scramble up onto the cloud.  A second soldier
tossed his spear aside and pulled himself up beside the first.  Together, they
reached back and hauled up a third man while Grappa Gas reached for a fourth.

But instead of grabbing the cloudherd's hand, the man on the ground lifted a
heavy canvas-wrapped bundle.  "Never mind that, get yourself up here!" Grappa
Gas ordered.

"We're not leaving them!" the man on the ground yelled back.  One of the
soldiers already on the cloud shouldered Grappa Gas aside, grabbed a corner of
the canvas, and tried to drag it onto the cloud.  His legs sank halfway to his
knees with the weight.

Noxy felt Big Blue shudder underneath her.  She dropped to her knees and pressed
her hand against the cloud once again.  *Just a little longer,* she pleaded,
trying to squelch her fear so that he couldn't mind-hear it.  *Stay bunched up
just a little longer.* She pictured the cloud pulling itself into a dense blob.
Obediently the cloud began to contract.

Even as it did so, Noxy heard a shrill warning whistle from her friends on board
Pillow high above them.  Cold fear jellied in her gut as the trolls suddenly
stopped hooting.

"Grappa---" she started to say.

"Just keep him together!" Grappa Gas snapped.  Cursing, he yanked another
soldier up onto the cloud.  This one was just a boy, Noxy realized, no older
than she was with a frightened, determined look on his scarred face.  He took
two steps before his feet slipped out from underneath him and sent him sprawling
beside one of the half-dozen canvas-wrapped bundles that lay together in a pile.

The tiger scrambled up the cloud behind him.  Noxy mind-heard Big Blue's protest
as the great cat's claws tore wisps off his flank.  *Just a little longer,* she
begged.  *Please, just a little longer.*

She glanced at the forest.  A brown wave spilled back and forth around the bases
of the trees.  Above it, the trolls began hooting again.  "Now now now!" the
Gifted ones shouted, the will of the forest surging through their minds like a
raging flood.  "Get them get them get them!"

"Spread yourselves out, you numbskulls!" Grappa Gas thundered at the soldiers
struggling not to sink into the cloud.  "Spread-eagle if you have to.  Come on,
Fee, we gotta fly!"

Noxy's grandmother clambered up Big Blue's flank with a speed born from decades
of practice.  "Now or never!" she yelled at the soldier who had been lifting up
the bundles.  He grabbed a handful of cloud just as a swarm of squirrels burst
out of the forest and surged up the rocky slope, thousands of them leaping from
stone to stone, their tiny eyes fixed on the intruders and just one thought in
their minds.

*Up!* Noxy mind-yelled at Big Blue.  The cloud heaved himself into the air.  As
the soldiers shouted and toppled over she heard Grappa Gas shout, "Hold on!"

The last soldier clung desperately to Big Blue as the cloud's flank squished
between his fingers like soggy dough.  The oncoming squirrels jumped at his
legs.  One managed to catch hold of his boot.  It scrambled up the laces and
sank its teeth into his calf.  The soldier cursed and kicked it off.  With a
last desperate lunge he managed to catch hold of Grappa Gas's hand.

"You idiot!" Grappa Gas yelled as he pulled the soldier up onto Big Blue's back.
"You saints-be-damned *idiot*!  They woulda peeled you like an apple!  What was
so weeping important that you couldn't just leave it?"  He kicked one of the
bundles at his feet.  "Eh?  What was so---urp!"

In one smooth motion the soldier had rolled onto his feet and grabbed a handful
of Grappa Gas's collar.  "With respect, honored, I'm grateful for the rescue,"
he panted, "But that's one of my men you're kicking, and I'll be thanking you to
stop."

He let go of Grappa Gas's coat.  The cloudherd coughed.  "Ah.  Sorry, lad.  I
didn't realize."  He looked down at the bodies lying at his feet.  "I'm sorry."

The soldier nodded.  "Me too."  He stared back at the pinnacle of rock, where
the squirrels had already torn the tents to pieces.  "Me too."

---

*Earlier that day...*

Noxy and Sensy volunteered to collect spiderwebs that morning---or rather, Noxy
volunteered them both and Sensy went along with it like she always did.  Winter
had finally turned to spring; stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the
shadows of the twisted mountain pines, but the sun shone diamond-bright in a
clear blue sky, and carding camel wool indoors suddenly seemed unbearable.
Besides, getting out of the village would give them a chance for a talk that
Noxy thought was long overdue.

"Shoo."  She poked a fat brown spider with a stick.  It waved its hairy forelegs
at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a new home.  Noxy cut its web's
anchor threads with two practiced twists of her knife and began winding it onto
a stick.

"Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?" Sensy asked.

Noxy glanced at her.  "Why? Are those ones coming loose?"  She had been trying
for an hour to think of a way to broach the subject of their mutual friend Rash,
who was the only boy their age in the village of Stale.

"No, they're just kind of plain." Sensy looked down at her soft brown camelskin
coat critically.  "Granna Fee has some really nice red ones.  She said she'd
give them to me if I picked the stones out of her pepper garden."

"Her whole garden? That would take forever." Noxy shook the dew off the spider's
web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder.  "Why
would you do all that work for buttons you don't need?"

"Oh, you're no help," Sensy pouted.  She had spent the winter embroidering red
and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar.  All she seemed to want to
talk about any more was her clothes, and her hair, and the boys she and Noxy
might meet that summer.  The only thing she *didn't* want to talk about was
Rash.

"A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes," Granna Fee had said
when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who seemed to have taken her
best friend's place.

"Not me!" Noxy had declared.

Her grandmother had laughed.  "No, sweetling, not you."

The three children had grown up together, done chores together, played tag and
make-believe in the forest around Stale together, and learned to mind-speak with
clouds together, but something had changed that winter.  Sometimes Noxy saw
Sensy look at Rash, or Rash look at Sensy, and then look away as if they felt
guilty or were afraid they might blurt out a secret.  Other times they just sat
there not speaking.  If her two best friends were mad at one another, Noxy
thought it was her job go sort it out.

Noxy slung her bag over her shoulder.  "Come on, let's go look for some more."
She set off without waiting for an answer.  A moment later Sensy scrambled to
catch up with her.

The path was one of dozens that snaked through the evergreen forest surrounding
Stale.  Mud made it slippery where it wasn't slick with ice, but Noxy didn't
slow down until she reached the ridge above her home.

Below her lay the ancient walls of the fortress that held the village of Stale.
The centuries had rounded the edges off the Pilots' stonework, making it look
like a snow fort that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as
the mountains themselves.  The villagers' two-story wooden houses sheltered
inside the fortress like ducklings in a nest.  Thin licks of smoke rose from
their slate chimneys, while camel pens, vegetable plots, and racks laden with
drying spiderwebs filled the spaces between them.

To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.  A net woven
from spider thread stretched over its top, as light as a dream but as strong as
steel.  Another net hung down at the gorge's mouth to make a gate.  Inside, just
visible from the ridge, two gray clouds floated half-asleep.

Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds, riding
them, and, most importantly, practicing mind-speech with them.  Grownups called
Big Blue and Pillow slow and lazy, but they and the herd of half-wild clouds
grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance were the most exciting things in
Noxy's world.

As Noxy pulled her bag off her shoulder, Sensy grabbed her arm.  "Look!"  she
hissed, pointing into the trees.

At first all Noxy saw was branches.  Then a pair of dark eyes blinked, and her
mouth went dry.  Black fur framed a round face with heavy brows and a gray
muzzle.  The troll blinked again and pulled a branch aside with one long, hairy
arm.

Noxy and Sensy took a step back, then another.  A sudden rustling behind them
made them freeze.  With her breath caught in her throat, Noxy looked over her
shoulder.  A second troll hung by one hand from a branch behind them, blocking
their escape.

"Wh-what are they doing here?" Sensy whispered loudly.

"Ssh!" Noxy said.  "Just... don't... move."

Branches rustled overhead.  Two--- three--- four trolls swung by, except no, the
fourth didn't swing by.  It stopped and looked down at them.  Its fur was shot
through with gray, and even from five strides below it Noxy could see the long
red scar that ran up the length of its left leg.

Something twinged in the back of her head like the start of a headache.  She
felt dizzy, and for a moment it was as if *she* was in the tree looking down at
herself.

A sudden roar broke the moment. The troll hooted and vanished into the forest.
Noxy and Sensy each let out a long shaky breath---

---and screamed as a tiger burst out of the trees half a dozen strides in front
of them.  His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes, not orange and black
like the picture in the book that three generations of village children had
passed around.  A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear, and his tail
twitched slightly as he looked at them, as if their presence reminded him that
he had not yet eaten lunch.

"Are you all right?" he rumbled.

"Wh-what?" Noxy stammered.

"Are... you... all... right?" the tiger repeated impatiently.  "Did those
blasted chimpanzees harm you at all?"

"No, they---I mean, we're all right.  We're fine, thank you very much.  Ouch,
Sensy, you're going to break my fingers!"  Noxy pulled her hand free from her
friend's terrified grip.

"Pilots be praised," he rumbled, settling onto his haunches.  "Now, if I may ask
a favor, I am looking for the village of Stale Leftovers.  Would you be so kind
as to direct me?"  His ear twitched at the sound of a distant hoot.  "Or if
perchance you are going that way yourselves, I would be honored to accompany
you.  Those creatures are unlikely to try another attack if you have a
protector."

Noxy hitched her bag up on her shoulder.  "They didn't attack us.  We---I mean,
the village has an arrangement.  With the trolls.  We don't go too far into the
forest, and they don't come near the village except for when they want to trade,
and they leave some stones down by the fish pond to tell us when they want to do
that, and---" She stopped herself and took a deep breath.  "I'm sorry.  Who are
you?"

"I am Kulbinder of Thind," the tiger said, rising to all fours.  "And if you
will forgive my impatience, my need is rather pressing.  My companions are in
danger, and in dire need of rescue.  I need to reach Stale Leftovers *now*."

Noxy shot a look at Sensy.  Her friend shook her head slightly and mouthed "no".
That was enough to make up Noxy's mind.

"It's this way," she said, pointing down the path.  "Come on!"

It only took them a few minutes to reach the gap in the fortress wall where an
enormous stone door had once hung.  A few chunks of its shattered remains lay
half-buried in the ground, too big for even a team of sturdy mountain camels to
pull free.  The wooden gate that Stale's human inhabitants had put up to take
its place was three planks thick, but still looked like a child's toy set into
the Pilots' ancient work.  It was open as always, and Noxy could hear the
endless gentle tune of the village's wind chimes from behind it.

Grappa Gas was sitting on one of the stones whittling a new leg when they came
out of the trees.  He raised a hand in hello, then swore and clambered to his
feet at the sight of the tiger.  "Saints and their creations!"  He pointed
accusingly with his whittling knife.  "What in the underhells is this?"

"*This* is a who, not a what," Kulbinder replied curtly.

"We met him up by the spider grove," Noxy said hurriedly.  "There were some
trolls, and he scared them off.  He says---"

"Trolls?"  Grappa Gas interrupted incredulously.  "Can't be.  They haven't come
down this far in---"

"Grappa!"  Noxy stomped her foot.  "Never mind that now!  The tiger says people
are hurt and need help.  At least, I think they're people," she added belatedly.

"They are as human as you are," the tiger said.  "Are you the *tralpa* here?"

Grappa Gas snorted.  "Not likely, but I can take you to the reeve."

Ten minutes later, the whole village was in the cobbled square---or rather, the
whole village minus most of the adults, who had left a week ago for the
snowfields to collect Stale's clouds from their winter pasture.  Three hundred
people, from babies in their parents' arms to those babies' grandparents, stood
in a half-circle around the impatient tiger.  Some still wore the thick coats
and pants they used in winter and when cloudherding.  Others, like Noxy and
Sensy, had switched to lighter gear that would still seem heavy to anyone
unfamiliar with the icy winds of the high mountains.  Grappa Gas's son Aft, who
had been splitting logs with an ax to make shingles, was the only one in
shirtsleeves, but he wasn't the only one scowling at the new arrival.  At his
side, his very pregnant wife Rind shushed him every time he muttered to her.

Noxy's mother Indy thumped the speaker's drum three times and stepped up onto
the squared-off stone that marked the center of the square.  "Friends," she said
loudly, patting the air with her hands to quiet everyone.  "Friends, please.
Thank you all for coming.  I know it is early in the year for travelers, but
please, give a true mountain welcome to Kulbinder, a Gifted of Thind."

"Welcome... welcome... be welcome..." Some voices were hearty, some grudging,
and some people didn't speak at all, but Noxy's mother took it all in stride,
just as she always did.

Someone nudged Noxy's shoulder with their own.  "Hey," Rash said, slipping
between her and Sensy.  "Where's the *tralpa*?  Is he too afraid of the tiger to
come out and say hello?  Or has he been up all night studying again?"  He mimed
someone drinking from a bottle.

"Ssh!"  But he was right---the voice and hand of the king in Stale Remainders,
who also happened to be the least useful magician Noxy had ever met, was nowhere
to be seen.

Indy thumped the brightly-painted speaker's drum again.  "The Gifted has told me
that he and his companions were trying to get through the pass to Chaghan.  An
avalanche forced them off the road and into the forest."  She swept her gaze
across the assembled villagers.  "The forest got angry.  Some of them have died,
and the rest are trapped.  They need our help."

A murmur ran through the crowd.  The Herd of Trees that blanketed the Brumoso
Mountains wasn't mad like the Jungle of Thind, but it guarded its territory and
privileges as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs.  Gifted creatures who
lived among the trees all did its biding.  People who stayed near the Pilots'
ancient roads never came to harm, and those who ventured deeper were safe as
long as they were careful.  Make a fire too large, though, or wander into one of
the circles of towering redwoods that Granna Fee cautioned Noxy and her friends
to steer clear of on training flights, and the forest's wrath would be as
merciless as a winter storm.

Aft elbowed his way to the front of the small crowd and clapped his hands twice.
"Are they smugglers?" he asked loudly without waiting for Indy to call on him.

Noxy saw rather than heard her mother's exasperated sigh.  "Not that the Gifted
has said, no."

"Then why in the saints' names were they trying to get through the pass this
time of year?  It'll be another month at least before the high trails clear."
He crossed his muscular arms.  "Doesn't seem like something honest folk would
do, is all I'm saying."

"My companions are not honest folk," the tiger sniffed.  "They are soldiers."

The crowd murmured again.  "Soldiers?" Aft said disbelievingly.  "What were you
doing trying to get through the pass?  There aren't any rebels up here."

At that, the tiger finally deigned to look at him.  "There are, actually.  It is
my companions' privilege to serve the cause of the Learned Shudarga."

That brought gasps instead of murmurs.  As a brilliant young scholar, Shudarga
had written pamphlet after pamphlet arguing that Gandan's laws should be free
for all to use.  The kingdom's merchant-nobles had ignored her at first, then
mocked her, but when she started organizing peasants and tradesmen to pool their
money so that they could rent laws together, their laughter turned to anger.
Arrested, she had escaped the previous summer and raised her flag in rebellion,
attracting thousands to her cause.  Then winter had come and news from the
lowlands had slowed to a trickle, leaving the cloudherds with nothing to chew on
but rumors.

"Does that mean the king's army is going to come looking for you?"  Aft demanded
loudly, putting a protective arm around his wife and ignoring Indy as she
thumped the drum for order.  "Because if they do, these walls won't keep 'em out
for long, and neither will we."

The tiger's tail twitched.  "I did not come to your village for its walls,
honored, or to ask you to fight.  My companions need help.  You are their only
hope---if you fear it will bring more trouble than you can chew, say so and I
will be on my way."

"Nobody is saying we won't help," Indy said firmly.  "And as long as I'm reeve,
nobody is *going* to say that."  She raised a hand to forestall whatever Aft had
been about to say.  "We can argue about the politics later.  Right now, there's
folk in trouble, and I won't have it said that the people of this village ever
turned their backs on those that needed help."

*Clap clap.* Granna Fee waited for Indy to nod at her before speaking. "What
about the *tralpa*?" she asked her daughter.  "I expect he'll have something to
say about us helping rebels."

Indy's smile was as cold as the distant peaks.  "We can ask him when he wakes
up."

---

The next five minutes were chaos.  Out of the question, Aft growled.  The law
might forgive them giving shelter to a bunch of strays stupid enough to anger
the forest, but flying off to rescue a bunch of rebels?  "It's not just us
they'll punish," he said, glancing meaningfully at the bulk under his wife's
winter coat.

And what would other cloudherds say if they heard that Stale had left people in
the forest to die, Grappa Gas shot back.  Pilots and saints, what would their
own kin say when they got back from up the mountain?

The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones, punctuated by soft
bings and bongs from the windchimes that hung from the eaves of every house.
Little whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart as
people overheard neighbors they disagreed with, or turned around to agree with
something they had overheard and were sucked into yet another "what if?"

"This is going to go on forever," Noxy said sourly.  "They're all going to do
whatever my *amma* want to do in the end---why don't they just get on with it?"
She, Sensy, and Rash stayed together in a knot on the sidelines, old enough that
they hadn't grown bored and run off to play like the younger children, but young
enough that the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.

Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a mustache.  It had
become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had told him countless times he
ought to break before *someone* broke his stupid finger.  "What I want to know
is whether we're going to get to go, or if we're going to be stuck here with the
littles."

"Of course we'll get to go!" Noxy exclaimed.

"You sure about that?"  Rash raised an eyebrow, another annoying habit he had
cultivated over the winter.  "Because your *amma*'s giving jobs to just about
everyone except us."

Noxy puffed an annoyed breath, biting off her "of course I'm sure!"  when she
caught Sensy's uncertain look.  "Wait here," she said with a scowl.

She strode through the crowd to the speaker's stone and caught her mother's eye.
Before Noxy could speak, Indy said, "Oh, and I think you've met my daughter,
Probably Noxious."

"The honor was mine," the tiger rumbled, flicking an ear in what might have been
the feline equivalent of a very small bow.

Noxy wondered if she was supposed to bow back, and was immediately annoyed at
herself.  Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a silly lowlander custom.  "Just call
me Noxy," she told him.  "*Amma*, which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash
on?  We can go and start getting them ready while everyone's still jawing."

Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well.  "Who said anything
about you three going?"

But Noxy knew her mother as well as her mother knew her, and had assembled her
arguments as she crossed the square.  They were definitely old enough---why,
they were all going to be riding *real* clouds in a few weeks, not just the tame
old pair floating in the cloud pen.  And they wouldn't be going far, just a few
gallops down the pass, and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to
do rescues, wasn't it?  And---

"Stop."  Her mother held up a hand, not noticing or just ignoring the amused
look on Granna Fee's face.  "You can go.  But!" she continued, "But you do what
you're told and nothing more, understood?"

Noxy nodded obediently.  "Yes, *amma*."  She had learned long ago not to keep
asking for a whole orange when she'd already talked her mother into a half.

Somehow everyone eventually realized that they agreed with Indy's decision or
were so outnumbered as to make further argument pointless.  Even Aft gave in,
grumbling that someone who hadn't lost his wits needed to keep an eye on things.

After that, it only took them a few minutes to gather what they needed.
Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and they had lifted more
than one tinker or trader out of a difficult spot.  Coils of hemp rope with
spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen, and
everyone kept a warm camelskin cap and some heavy gloves handy just in case.

"You look ridiculous," Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the wooden steps
to the mounting platform.  He had sewn a pattern that he claimed was meant to be
eagle's wings onto the side flaps of his cap during the winter, and had wrapped
a bright yellow scarf around his neck that the last of the autumn pack traders
had sworn was all the rage in Gandan.

Rash looked her up and down.  "Really?  Because I think you look amazing. Excuse
me."  He winked and stepped around the speechless pair of thirteen-year-olds.

They were the last to arrive at the wooden platform that hung over the edge of
the cloud pen.  "Ears all!" Aft said loudly.  He had changed into heavy pants, a
padded coat, and a pair of soft boots, and his hair was pulled back in a thick
club braid tied with a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar.  "You know
how this is done.  I'll lead on Pillow with the younglings as spotters and the
Gifted as a guide.  Gas and Fee, you've got Blue---you take Noxy with you.  In
and out, quick and simple, and everyone's back here for soup before you can
sneeze.  No adventures, right?"  He glared at Noxy, Sensy, and Rash until the
three teenagers mumbled, "No adventures."

"Right!"  He walked to the end of the plank that stuck out from the platform and
whistled through his fingers.  When nothing happened, he muttered something
about "soggy" and "lazy" and whistled again more loudly.

A hundred strides away and fifty strides below them, a foggy-edged blue-gray
mass rippled and began to pull itself into something dense enough to hold the
weight of a person.  The second, smaller blob next to it followed suit.  Side by
side, Big Blue and Pillow drifted toward the villagers and the lone tiger
waiting at the edge of the ravine.  A clattering noise further along the ravine
signalled that whoever Indy had sent to pull back the pen's spiderweb gate had
started hauling in the bamboo chain it hung from.

Noxy watched breathlessly as the clouds approached, their leading edges rippling
slightly in the wind.  When Big Blue bumped against the ravine wall, Aft took
three steps and jumped off the end of the plank.

Noxy leaned over the railing.  One, two, three... Big Blue dimpled as the burly
cloudherd tucked, flipped over, spread-eagled, and landed flat on his back.
Gray waves rippled out across the cloud's back as Aft rolled over onto his knees
and pressed his hands down firmly.  Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his
eyes would be closed in concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount.

"Show off," Grappa Gas muttered beside her.

Granna Fee elbowed him.  "Gets it from his old man."

Something twinged in the back of Noxy's head.  She blinked.  "Did you say
something?" she asked Sensy.

"What?"  She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.

"Never mind."  Noxy shook her head.  "Look, he's coming up."

Big Blue rose toward the platform, bunching into an evern firmer mass as he
neared them.  Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the cloud's back
so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.

A silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, cawing its displeasure at
the sight of a human just a few strides away.  Aft looked up and smiled the
smile he only ever wore when he was on cloudback or holding hands with his wife.
With a whoop he ran across across Big Blue's back and launched himself into the
air again.

Rash whistled.  "Nice leap," he said appreciatively as Aft landed dead center on
Pillow.  "And blind, too."

"It's not such a trick," Noxy said dismissively, though she was secretly
impressed.  "He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she was."

"Sure, but would you trust a cloud's eyes that much?"  Rash challenged her.
"Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out of what they say."

Noxy shrugged.  She had realized early in their training that mind-speech was a
lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash, or even for some of the olders
who were already riding.  She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered
accusations of showing off.  The only person she shared her progress with now
was her grandmother, and she didn't even tell Granna Fee everything.

Grappa Gas made everyone wait until Pillow was only a couple of strides below
the mounting platform before he let Sensy and Rash jump.  The teenagers had been
doing it since they were children, but the brief moment of flight and *poof!* as
they landed still made them whoop just like Aft had.

Aft steered the cow out of the way so that Big Blue could take her place beneath
the plank.  Grappa Gas landed on him with a soft *thud*.  Granna Fee tossed down
two bundles of blankets.  "Your turn," she said to Kulbinder.

The tiger's ears lay flat against his skull, and his tail whipped from side to
side.  For a moment Noxy was sure he was going to refuse, but with a sudden
burst of speed he charged to the end of the plank and jump.  She and Granna Fee
leaned over the railing.

"Huh," Granna Fee said.  "I guess they really do always land on their feet."

*Twinge.* Noxy winced and put her hand on the back of her head.  There it was
again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?

Her grandmother noticed her expression.  "Are you all right?"

"Sure," Noxy lied.  One of the grownups' many rules was that no one should fly
if they were sick, and she was *not* going to be left behind.  "Come on, let's
see if you remember your lessons."

"Cheeky," her grandmother said.  Three quick steps and a little hop and she was
gone, leaving Noxy alone on the platform.  She took a deep breath, grinned, and
sprinted for the end of the plank.

She landed just a stride away from her grandmother, who was still lying flat on
her back on the cloud.  "Oof," Granna Fee grunted, rolling over and sitting up.
"He's not as soft as he used to be."  Then she smiled and put her arm around
Noxy so that her granddaughter could lean against her as she pressed her hand
against Big Blue and closed her eyes.  The cloud turned obediently and began
drifting toward the mouth of the gorge.

"I'll take lead," Aft called back through cupped hands.

"Really? How unusual of you," Granna Fee said just loudly enough for Noxy to
hear.  She steered Big Blue into position behind the smaller cow.  As she did
so, Aft took the ox horn from his belt and blew three loud notes, low high low.
Indy blew an answering note as the two clouds passed through the gate and into
the wide expanse of the pass.

Cloudherding is cold work, even in the summer.  In the spring, in the mountains,
when breath still fogs and the wind pokes its fingers through every loose seam
and down every collar, it's freezing.  As they passed through the mouth of the
ravine, Granna Fee took a camel hair blanket from the nearest bundle and wrapped
it around herself and Noxy, leaving only their faces exposed.  Up ahead, Noxy
saw that Rash and Sensy had done the same---as Sensy said, he might be a goof,
but at least he was a *warm* goof.

Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected.  "Saints and their inventions, but I love
this," he sighed.  He'd brought a cushion to rest his wooden leg on so that it
wouldn't poke into Big Blue, but a long scarf only slightly less exuberant than
the one Rash was wearing was his only concession to the freezing temperature.
"Look, the condors are back in their nest!  We should invite them them to visit
some time."

"They're not really the most sociable creatures," Granna Fee said dryly.

Grappa Gas harrumphed.  "You just have to get to know them.  I wonder if any of
their chicks will be Gifted this year?  That would be a thing, wouldn't it?"

It had taken the tiger a day to hike up the pass to Stale Leftovers.  The
cloudherds covered the same distance half an hour, even with the headwind.
"There," Granna Fee said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.

Grappa Gas frowned, then looked at Kulbinder.  "I thought you said there were
just a few of them."

"Fewer than we started with," the tiger growled.  He had spent most of the
flight crouched down to get out of the wind, his legs and tail tucked underneath
his body.  Now he stood and padded forward to join Granna Fee at Big Blue's
leading edge.

The soldiers' makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock that rose out of
the forest like an island.  A dozen drab tents huddled around a small fire.
Shading her eyes with her hand, Noxy saw a dozen men moving about, some propped
against one another to stay upright.

Grappa Gas gave a low whistle.  "The *tralpa* really isn't going to like this,"
he said.

"Never mind him," Granna Fee replied.  "What do you think my daughter is going
to say?"

One of the soldiers spotted them a moment later.  They were too far away to hear
his shouts, but there was no mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms,
or in the way his companions hurried to roust their injured comrades.

"Keep your eyes wide," Grappa Gas ordered Noxy curtly.  "Forest might be happy
to let us take them, or it might not."

It wasn't.  An angry voice cawed behind them, then a hundred more, and all at
once they were surrounded by a flock of gray-shouldered mountain crows, each one
an angry feathered missile with sharp claws and a pecking beak.  Noxy screamed
as a crow grabbed her hair.  Another took hold of her collar and pecked her
shoulder.  She screamed again, swatting at them as Granna Fee and Grappa Gas
yelled and did the same.  She could *feel* their anger coursing through her
veins.

The tiger's roar sent the birds wheeling into the air above them and hurtling
away.  Noxy slapped at her hair one last time, not quite believing the attack
was over.

A faint shout from up ahead told her that it wasn't.  Aft spun the end of a coil
of rope over his head to keep them at bay while Sensy and Rash batted at any
bird that came too close.

The birds swirled around them for a dozen heartbeats before veering away.  Aft
handed the rope to Rash and knelt to press his hands against Pillow.  A moment
later he looked up and shook his head grimly.  "She's terrified," he bellowed
through cupped hands.  "Won't go any closer.  We have to leave them!"

"Underhells with that," Grappa Gas muttered.  "Fee---I'll get Blue down there.
You 'n' Noxy get 'em loaded up fast as you can."

"But---" Granna Fee protested.

"Hold on!" Grappa Gas bellowed as they went into a dive.  "It's going to get
bumpy!"

---

They hardly said a word on the way back to Stale.  The young soldier even fell
asleep, snoring gently with his head on the tiger's flank.  His companions
watched the mountains go by, too exhausted to show more than an occasional
flicker of interest. in the fact that the whole world was now spread out beneath
them.

With her hand on Big Blue's back, Noxy could feel how unhappy the cloud was.  It
wasn't just that he was carrying strangers, or that those strangers were
bleeding and miserable.  When clouds died, they just spread out into nothing.
The thought that something could end but still be there---that it could go from
being alive to being like a rock or a log---made the canvas-wrapped corpses on
his back frightening in a way that storm winds and lightning would never be.

*Sh, sh, sh,* Noxy mind-spoke soothingly, stroking the cloud as if he was a
skittish newborn camel.  *Home soon, then rest.* At that moment, she wanted it
just as much as the cloud.

Grappa Gas brought Big Blue down in front of the village gate where he had been
contentedly whittling only an hour before.  Wearily, the soldiers up slid off
the bull's back to stand among the bright green ferns of spring.  The waiting
villagers came forward to offer them blankets, then stepped back, unsure what to
do next.

Indy didn't let them stand idle for long---she never did.  "Get everyone up into
the traders' hall," she ordered crisply.  "And get a couple of pots of stew
going---and tea.  Lot of tea.  You do drink tea, don't you?" she asked the
nearest soldier.

Rash and Sensy came up the trail from the cloud pen, where Aft had taken Pillow.
"Are you all right?" Sensy asked anxiously.

"I'm fine," Noxy lied.  "But those crows---that was horrible.  I've never seen
the forest that angry."

"I never want to again," Sensy said, shivering.

Rash nudged her shoulder with his.  "Where's the tiger gone?" he asked Noxy.

A terrified shout from inside the ancient walls was his answer.  A heartbeat
later the village *tralpa* stumbled through the gate, tripping over the hem of
the flowing lowlander-style robe he always wore (and occasionally washed).
"There's--- there's a--- Reeve!  Reeve!  What is *that creature* doing here?"
He snapped his fingers.  A tiny spark sputtered and died at their tips.

"Saints give me strength," Noxy's mother muttered.  She caught her daughter's
eye, sighed faintly, and then put on the smile she always wore when talking to
people she didn't like and turned to face the king's official representative to
the village of Stale Leftovers.

Scholar-Candidate Nangyal---he insisted that the villagers use the title, even
though he was a decade past the age at which most candidates removed that
qualifier from their titles---looked as though he had slept in his clothes and
only just woken up, which he probably had.  Like the soldiers who straightened
up when they caught sight of his official gray scarf, he had a lowlander's round
face and near-black skin.  But where they were lean, he sagged, and where the
soldiers had only a few days of stubble on their shaved heads, his frizzy hair
and failed beard were as unruly as the ferns he trampled as he strode over to
Indy and glared at her.

"Reeve, are you aware that there is an *animal* in the village?" he demanded
icily.

"A Gifted, Scholar-Candidate," she replied.  "His name is Kulbinder.  He arrived
this morning."

"Well, why was I not informed?  And who are *these* people?" he continued,
jabbing a finger at the soldiers.  "You!  Sergeant!  What are you doing here?
Just look at your uniform---it's a disgrace!"

The soldier who had been the last to climb onto Big Blue nodded.  "It isn't
quite regimental standard, is it, honored?" he acknowledged ruefully.  "Nothing
a bar of soap won't put right, though.  I'll see to it once my men are settled."

"Settled?"  The *tralpa* looked from the sergeant to his men and back to the
sergeant.  His sour look brightened to merely displeased.  "Well, *finally*.
This is long overdue.  *Long* overdue," he repeated, nodding agreement with
himself.  "I've been writing letters for *months*.  No offense to His Majesty,
of course, but I don't think people realize just how strategically important
this pass is.  And the clouds---why, if those upstart peasants were to somehow
gain control of them, there's no telling what might---"

The sergeant cleared his throat.  "Actually, honored, it wasn't His Majesty who
sent us."  A lump rose in Noxy's throat as one of his men very casually
positioned himself behind Nangyal, his hand falling to the hilt of his sword.

The whole village held its breath.  One heartbeat, two...  "You're---you're
*traitors*!?" the *tralpa* spluttered.  "Here!?"

His face screwed up as if he was having a particularly difficult visit to the
outhouse, and for a moment Noxy thought he might actually manage to cast a
spell.  He had tried so hard when he first arrived in Stale two years ago,
working night and day to master enough of the basics to pass the annual
examinations in the capital, "And be posted somewhere with *restaurants*," he
was heard to mutter more than once.  But nothing worked, and nothing worked, and
now he spent most of his time alone in the biggest house in the village with his
bottles and his broken dreams.

A moment passed in breathless anticipation before the *tralpa* gave up and
pointed at the sergeant imperiously.  "Reeve!  Arrest these men immediately!" he
ordered.

"No." "No!" Indy and the sergeant said simultaneously.  The sergeant shook his
head almost imperceptibly at the soldier behind the *tralpa*.  Obediently, the
man slid his half-drawn sword back into its sheath.

The sergeant turned to Indy.  "Honored?  If you don't want us here, we'll go,
but we won't suffer arrest."

"Nobody's arresting anybody," she interrupted in exasperation.  "Not today,
anyway.  No---with respect, Scholar-Candidate, these men are travelers, and
injured, and more importantly, we need to lay their dead to rest before they
ghost.  Sergeant---I'm sorry, I don't know your name?"

"Dorbu, honored---Gandan's Eighteenth Dorbu" the sergeant replied, dipping his
head respectfully.

"Sergeant Dorbu," Indy continued in a how-it's-going-to-be voice that left no
room for disagreement, "Do you promise that you and your men will take no action
against His Majesty while you're our guests?"

"You have my word, honored," the sergeant said.

"And mine," Kulbinder rumbled, "Since I am not, as the *tralpa* so quickly
observed, a man."  Noxy jumped.  The tiger had padded up behind them all while
they were talking, the boy with the scarred face a pace behind him.

The *tralpa* stumbled backed a step, tripping over the hem of his robe once
again.  "What?  No!  Reeve, I *order* you to arrest these men!  And this
creature!  They are *rebels*!  They are *traitors*!  You can't trust them!"

Instead of replying, Sergeant Dorbu unbuckled his sword belt and held it out to
Indy.  The reeve blinked.  "What am I supposed to do with that?"

"Whatever you want," the soldier said.  "And lock me up if it makes anyone feel
safer.  Just so long as someone looks after my men."

"As I think I just said, that won't be necessary," Indy replied tartly.  "Let's
just get everyone warmed up and fed, shall we?  Then it will be time for dinner
and then we can do right by your dead and then we can all get some sleep and
sort this out in the morning."

The *tralpa* drew himself up.  "That is *unacceptable*!" he spat.  "These men
have taken arms against His Majesty!  You!"  He pointed at Grappa Gas.  "In the
king's name, I hereby appoint you acting reeve.  Arrest these men and then
arrest *her*!"  He swivelled his arm to point accusingly at Indy.

Grappa Gas had been stroking Big Blue's flank, mind-speaking to the old bull to
calm him after their turbulent flight.  He looked from the indignant *tralpa* to
the sergeant to the reeve and back to the *tralpa*.  "Can't do that, honored,"
he said cheerfully.  "I have to get this old boy back in his pen."

Sergeant Dorbu's shoulders slumped slightly.  "Thank you, honored," he said to
Indy, buckling his sword back on.  With a grunt, he squatted and lifted one of
the canvas bundles onto his shoulder.  "If there's somewhere we could...?"

"I'll show you the way," Granna Fee said.

The *tralpa* stormed and raged for a few moments longer, but once he realized
that no one was paying attention he wrapped his robe and what was left of his
dignity around himself and marched back the house that he shared with his books,
his bottles, his failed attempts at magic, and his resentment of everyone and
everything outside the walls of the distant capital.

Noxy barely noticed his door slam.  Once the soldiers who were well enough had
picked up their comrades' bodies, and the rest had been led through the gate to
have their injuries tended to, and Rash and Sensy went to find spare blankets
for the soldiers, she somehow found herself alone.  Feeling somewhat deflated,
she went looking for something to do.

Her mother was still organizing people in the square.  Yes, the soldiers would
use the trading hall, she'd already said that.  Yes, the wounded too---where
else would they go?  And yes, there *were* more than a few of them, but there
was nothing they could do about that now.  Oh for the saints' sakes, of *course*
they would eat beans.  And no, she didn't know what the tiger was planning to
eat, but she would find out.

"There you are," she said when she caught sight of her daughter.  "Can you
please go home and make some tea?  Use all the honey we have left, and tell
whoever shows up that I'll be there as soon as I can."

The water hadn't even boiled before Grappa Gas rapped on the door with his
knuckles and entered.  "Hey there.  Where's your *amma*?"

"She should be back soon," Noxy said.  She added a handful of dark brown leaves
to the cinnamon bark and green cardamom pods already in the pot.  It was an
extravagance---the pack traders who brought such delicacies to the village
wouldn't start visiting until the last of the snow had melted, which was at
least another month away---but Granna Fee had always said that a sweet cup of
tea was worth a thousand words.

"Mind if I sit?"  Grappa Gas asked as he settled himself on a stool that was at
least as old as he was and watched Noxy drizzle the last of the honey into the
pot.

"What did you find out?" she asked after a moment.

The old man snorted affectionately.  "Just like your *amma*, aren't you? And
your granna, too.  Always thinking one step ahead of everyone else.  You know,
if your granna hadn't been so smart, I might've wound up being your grappa.  I
remember once when---"

"Grappa!" Noxy cut in, exasperated and amused by his teasing at the same time.
"Tell me what the soldiers said!"

"And how do you know they said anything?" Grappa Gas challenged.

"Because they're a long way from home, and tired, and frightened even if they
don't let it show, and want us to like them," Indy answered, closing the door
behind her as she came in.  "And because I saw you talking the ear off Sergeant
Dorbu on your way into the trading hall.  Now, what did he say?  And how in the
saints' names did a bunch of the king's soldiers wind up *here*?"  She kissed
the old man on his grizzled cheek and sat on the other stool.

For a moment all Grappa Gas could think of was how alike mother and daughter
were.  Noxy's hair was brown and wavy like her father's instead of straight and
black like her mother's, and her nose sharper than was common among the
mountain-born, but they had the same strong wills and quick minds.  When Indy
had turned ten, he had predicted that she would be reeve before she was thirty.
*Better start telling everyone that Noxy's going to beat that,* he thought.

He slurped his tea, then cradled the warm mug in his hands.  "The sergeant said
that they were posted over on the border with Lhabde.  There's been heavy snow
this winter, so they were stuck in their barracks most of the time and got to
talking, and..."  He shrugged.  "One thing led to another, I guess.  By the time
the snow had melted enough that they can get on the road, some of 'em said they
weren't going to fight their own neighbors.  Their colonel didn't take well to
that, so he hanged a couple of them, and that helped the rest figure out which
side they wanted to be on."

"So why were they trying to come through the pass?" Indy asked.

Grappa Gas shrugged again.  "They were supposed to be headed down to the
capital, but the king's men hit them at the ford near Duck Droppings.  They were
split cross the two sides of the river when the attack came."  For a moment his
years showed on his face.  "He doesn't expect he'll see many of his friends
again."

Indy glanced at Noxy.  "That doesn't go out of this house," she ordered.  Noxy
nodded, turning to the stove as the lid on the kettle began to whistle.  She
lifted it carefully with a pair of chopsticks to pour the boiling water into the
teapot, then put the kettle back on the stove and set the tea on the table to
steep.

"Was there anything else?" Indy asked.

The front door banged open before he could answer.  Aft strode in and glared at
Indy.  "What in the underhells do you think you're doing?" he demanded.

"Well, good day to you too, son," Grappa Gas drawled, leaning back and lacing
his fingers behind his head.

Aft stabbed a finger toward him.  "Stow that.  Indy, this is madness.  I don't
like the *tralpa* any more than anyone else, but as soon as he gets word down
the mountain that we've gone over to the rebels---"

"Stop," Indy said sharply.  She stood up and gestured at her stool.  "Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.  And then take a deep breath before you say another
word.  We have *not* gone over to anything.  We are not taking any side in this,
not as long as I'm reeve.  Noxy?  Go get the peeling stool from out back.  Brush
it off before you bring it in the house."

Aft glowered at her and his father a moment longer, then sat, the stool creaking
in protest under his weight.  Noxy hastily fetched the spare stool from the rear
of the house and set it down for her mother, then poured tea as inconspicuously
as she could while Aft ticked points off on his fingers.  What would the village
do if the king sent an army after the rebels?  And by "if", he meant "when",
because the *tralpa* was sure to be writing another one of his letters while
they were sitting there, and this one would surely get an answer.  They couldn't
fight, not with most of the adults gone, and even once they were back, there
weren't more than a handful of people in the village who'd ever swung a sword,
not that they actually had any swords to swing.  They'd be lucky not to wind up
in prison, and even if they didn't, the village would be paying double taxes for
the next hundred years.

"So what do think we should do?" Grappa Gas challenged.  "Turn them out?  They
wouldn't make it more'n a couple of gallops before they froze or the forest tore
'em apart.  I can just hear what folk would say if we did that.  Or maybe you
think we can take 'em prisoner?"  He mimed swinging a sword.

"Enough."  Indy set her mug down with a thump.  "Enough, both of you.  We have a
stormload of trouble to fly through, and I will *not* have you two making it
worse with your bickering."  She stared into her tea as if hoping the tiny
swirling leaves might spell out some answers.  "I know it's a big thing," she
went on quietly.  "And I did think about turning them away, but Gas is
right---they wouldn't even make it to Rancid.  How would that make us look?"

Aft scowled.  "What people think won't matter much once the king hears about
this.  No, wait, hear me out.  Saving travelers who got caught on the mountain,
well, we can explain that if we have to.  But letting them stay here---saints
and all their gifts, Indy, what'll they do to us?  What'll they do to *her*?"
He jabbed his finger at Noxy.

"And what about the tiger?" he continued before Indy could reply.  "What are we
supposed to feed it?  Or should I ask 'who'?"

"Disgusting Aftertaste!" Indy snapped.  "I will *not* have that kind of talk
about one of the Gifted.  Especially not in front of my daughter."

"Just saying," Aft muttered.  He swallowed the last of his tea in one gulp and
stood up.  "Just think about it, all right?"  He squeezed his strong hands into
impotent fists, then turned and left without saying goodbye.

"Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if he *did* eat some of us!" Grappa Gas
called after him.  "Maybe we'd have some peace and quiet around here!"

He turned back to Indy.  "Don't worry about him.  He's just worried about the
baby.  Everyone gets wound up their first time."

"I know," Indy smiled.  With their first baby due in just a few weeks, Aft and
his wife Rind had stayed behind when the other adults left for the mountains to
gather the village's herd.  The double weight of becoming a father and not being
up in his element had made him as fidgety as a young camel in springtime.

Grappa Gas drained the last of his own tea.  "It's good," he told Noxy
appreciatively.  "Maybe wants more cinnamon next time, though."

"I'll try to remember," Noxy promised.

Indy stood when Grappa Gas did.  "Will you stay for dinner?"

He shook his head.  "Thanks, girl, but I promised your mother I'd, um, peel her
potatoes."  He winked, ignoring Noxy's little 'eww' of disgust.  Indy smiled and
kissed him on the cheek again.  He was humming as he stumped out the door.

Noxy waited until her mother said down again before saying, "*Amma*...?"

"Yes, sweetling?"

Noxy hesitated.  She didn't know where to start.  "Do you think the king really
will send an army after them?"

Indy laughed wearily.  "Probably not a whole army.  But they won't be here long
enough for us to have to worry about that."

Mother and daughter sat in silence for a moment.  Finally Indy stretched.  "So
tell me, did you collect any spiderwebs, or did you and Sensy spend the whole
day mooning after Rash?"

"*Amma*! And how can you think about spiderwebs on a day like this?  And anyway,
nobody's mooning after Rash."  She sighed.  "He and Sensy are hardly talking to
each other right now.  I think they had some kind of fight, but I haven't had a
chance to sort it out."

Her mother shook her head.  "It isn't your job to sort them out.  Maybe you
should just---"

*Crash!* They jumped as something landed on the roof above their heads, sending
loose shingles skittering.

"What in the names...?"  Indy crossed the floor in three steps and threw open
the door just as a troll landed in the narrow street in front of their house.
She yelped and flung herself to the side as the hairy creature lunged past her
and scrambled up the stairs on all fours.

With a roar, the tiger burst into the kitchen and skidded to a stop.  "Which way
did it go?" he demanded, his ears back and his tail lashing.

The sound of a door banging upstairs answered his question before Indy could.
"Wait!" she shouted as the tiger took the steps three at a time, only to roar,
"Blast, the blighter's gone through the window!"

Indy slammed the door shut and stepped in front of it.  "What in the saints'
names are you *doing*?" she demanded as the tiger raced back down the stairs.

"He was spying on us!" the tiger snarled.  "Now let me pass!"

"No!" The mayor of Stale glared at him.  "This is *our* village, and you will
*not* race around like a madman, is that clear?"

It was the bravest thing Noxy had ever seen her mother do, and for one horrible
moment, she was afraid it would be the last.  The muscles in the tiger's
shoulders bunched---and then relaxed.  "Hardly a mad *man*, honored," he
rumbled, as calmly as if he was complimenting her on her taste in teapots.

Whatever Indy might have said was forestalled by a tentative knock on the door
at her back.  The tiger twitched his whiskers.  "Are you going to answer that?"

Indy waited precisely as long as it would take Noxy to count to ten in her head,
then turned and opened the door.  "Yes?"

The young soldier with the scarred face saluted.  "Excuse me, honored," he
panted, "But I'm looking for---oh.  There you are.  Sorry, honored, I couldn't
keep up.  Did you catch him?"

"No," the tiger growled.  "It turns out that these houses have windows.  Did you
see which way the others went?"

The young soldier shook his head.  He wasn't much older than she was, Noxy
realized.  "Sorry, honored, I didn't."

The tiger's tail twitched.  "Reeve?  Any idea why a mob of chimpanzees would be
creeping around the village?"

"We call them trolls here, thank you," Indy said, her voice full of polite
steel.  "They're our neighbors.  And I imagine they were doing what any neighbor
would do if a bunch of strangers showed up next door---having a look to see
what's going on."

"There were some trolls up by the spiderweb orchard this morning," Noxy said,
immediately wishing she hadn't when three heads turned to look at her.  "They
stopped Sensy and me when we were coming back down."

"This morning? Why didn't tell me?" her mother demanded.

"It's been kind of busy!" Noxy said defensively.  "Anyway, they were all bigger
than this one.  I think," she amended.

The tiger's tail twitched.  "Big or small, they steer well clear of settlements
in Thind."

"They do here as well," Indy said, beckoning the young soldier to come in as she
spoke.  "We've had an arrangement with them for, oh, I don't know how long.
They keep to the deep forest, we stay out of it, and every fall a few of their
Gifted show up to trade whatever odds and ends they have for some dried fruit or
candy."

"Hrrm."  The tiger's tail twitched again.  "If they saw soldiers on the road,
would they tell you?  Or us?"

Indy shook her head.  "Only if they were in trouble, and even then they wouldn't
do it if the forest was angry.  As you discovered," she added to the soldier,
who had come two steps into the kitchen.

On impulse, Noxy stuck out her hand.  "Hi, I'm Probably Noxious, but everyone
calls me Noxy."

The soldier blinked, glanced at the tiger, and then gave her hand a single firm
shake.  "Private Thokmay, honored.  Thank you for rescuing us."

"I'm glad we could help," Noxy said.  "And---I'm sorry for your loss.  Your
losses," she amended.

The soldier dipped his head.  "Thank you, honored."  He glanced at the tiger.

"We should see if the sergeant needs any help with preparations," he said,
rising to all fours.

"Of course," Indy said, her voice warm once again.  "Please let him know that
we'll be there at sundown.  And if there's anything we can do to help..."

The tiger's boy stepped aside to let the great cat pass, then dipped his head to
Indy and Noxy once again before following his master.  Noxy closed the door
behind them and let out her breath in a long whoosh.  "Well," she said, "That
wasn't scary at all."

Her mother sat back down on her stool and squeezed her daughter's hand.  "Hardly
at all," she agreed.  "Are you all right?"

Noxy's response was somewhere between a snort and a laugh.  Her mother squeezed
her hand again.  "Good.  How would you feel about scrambled eggs tonight?"  She
took down their frying pan without waiting for an answer and set it on the stove
beside the kettle.

"Are you going to go and help them...?" Noxy asked as she began to set the
table, not knowing quite how to finish the sentence.

Her mother glanced at her.  "Help them send off their dead?  Yes.  You don't
have to come if you don't want to."

Noxy shrugged.  "I'll come."

They had two eggs each atop the grilled parsnips left over from the night
before, with stewed snow cabbage and a small onion chopped almost to mush.  They
talked sporadically while they cooked and ate, leaving sentences half-finished
and changing direction like bats chasing bugs on a summer's evening.

When they were done, Indy pushed her plate away and reached across the table to
squeeze her daughter's hand.  "You really can stay here if you want, you know."

Noxy squeezed back.  "I know.  But then who will look after you?"

They dressed for the cold.  Noxy took the box of candles from the shelf beside
the stairs while her mother carefully wound the embroidered gray scarf of her
office around her neck.  With a brief prayer to the named and nameless saints,
Indy lit one of the candles and stood it on the table so that they would come
home to light.  They closed the door gently behind them, brushed their hands
over the windchimes that hung from the eaves to set them ringing, and set off
toward the square.

A handful of other villagers joined them on their way, Grappa Gas and Granna Fee
among them, but no one spoke---the soft sound of windchimes echoing through the
village said everything that need to be said.

When they reached the square, they found the soldiers well enough to stand
waiting, patient and quiet in the way of people who have met sorrow before and
know that they will meet it again.  They had cleaned their armor, or nearly, and
what bandages were in evidence were fresh.  Kulbinder and Private Thokmay stood
a little to the side, the young soldier's hand resting on the nape of the
tiger's neck.  He withdrew it when Noxy nodded to him in greeting, but returned
her nod.  The tiger merely blinked.

In silence, the small crowd made their way through the gate and up the path that
led to the village's worship circle.  Sergeant Dorbu and two other soldiers had
piled pitch-smeared logs on the heavy gray stone that lay at the circle's
center, then laid the bodies of their fallen friends atop the logs.  They stood
at attention as people shuffled into a circle, their battle masks raised to show
their stony expressions.  No one spoke except the smallest children, who were
immediately hushed.

Noxy scanned the crowd, hoping to see Rash or Sensy, but neither was there.
"Where's the *tralpa*?"  she whispered to her mother.  *And where is Aft?* she
wondered.  The big cloudherd often led the villagers' Purplesday worship, but
tonight he was nowhere to be seen.

"Ssh!" As the last corner of the sun disappeared behind the peaks, Indy nodded
to the sergeant.  Saluting in return, he took a flint from a pouch on his belt,
drew his sword, and scraped sparks onto the nearest log.

The crowd held its breath.  The first tiny flame hesitated a moment, then began
to spread.  Everyone exhaled with relief.  There would be no unquiet ghosts to
trouble the villagers and the dead men's comrades.  The soldiers' spirits would
rest.

As dark smoke wrote its message of loss and grief on the sky, Sergeant Dorbu
cleared his throat.  "When I die, I shall give back to the world all that I did
not do.  All that I might have been and wasn't, all the things I lost and spent
and wasted, I shall give them back to the lives that haven't been lived yet.
That will be my thanks to those I loved, and to the world that gave me the
life."

Around him, soldiers and villagers bowed their heads and murmured, "That will be
my thanks." In ones and twos they stepped forward to light candles from the
funeral flames, then turned toward home.  One of the soldiers wept openly and
without shame.  Noxy saw Private Thokmay wipe tears from his cheek and then
straighten his back and square his shoulders, cupping his candle to shelter it
from the wind so that it could in turn be his shield against the darkness.

It was as solemn a moment as she could remember, which is why her heart sank
when they rounded the corner and saw the *tralpa* standing in front of the gate
with a dayglass lantern at his feet, his frizzy hair combed and tied back, and
his scarf of office folded precisely into place.  In one hand he held a book so
thick it was almost a cube.  Tiny flames danced across the fingertips of the
other, and Noxy wondered how many tries it had taken him to make that simple
spell work.

"Oh no," Granna Fee breathed beside her.  "Not now.  Not *now*."

As the villagers approached, Nangyal puffed out his chest.  "Literally
Indigestible, by election from its inhabitants and with the consent of His
Majesty Denpa King Gandan made reeve of the village of Stale Leftovers, come
forward!"

Ten strides ahead of Noxy and her grandmother, Indy handed her candle to
Sergeant Dorbu with a quiet, "Thank you."  She waited a moment for the soldiers
and villagers behind her to come to a halt, and another for the whispers to grow
still.  "This is not the time or place, Scholar-Candidate," she said, her voice
carrying clearly on the cold evening breeze.

But the *tralpa* plowed on.  "As the king's voice in this place, I require you,
Literally Indigestible, to answer to a charge of insubordination."  He flicked
his hand a couple of times to blow out the flames he had summoned and then
opened his book, cursing under his breath and stooping to pick up the bookmark
that fluttered to the ground.  Tucking it under his arm, he raised the book with
both hands to show a page that was almost black with dense print.

"I'm sorry, Scholar-Candidate, but that's a bit difficult to read in this
light," Indy said calmly.  "Perhaps we could make some tea and---"

"As the king's voice in this place," the *tralpa* continued loudly, "I require
you also to answer to an additional charge of derelection of duty, inasmuch as
you have---damn it."  The bookmark slipped out from under his arm and fluttered
to the ground again.  "Inasmuch as you have neglected a *direct order* to arrest
those who have freely admitted that they are in open rebellion against His
Majesty."

Before Indy could reply, Sergeant Dorbu stepped forward.  "Am I going to have to
put this down, honored?" he asked gently, raising his candle slightly, its
delicate yellow flame protected by his cupped hand.

The *tralpa* snapped his book shut.  "I do *not* hear the words of traitors," he
said haughtily.

"I see.  Honored, could you take this please?" The sergeant handed his candle to
Indy, ignoring her startled protest, and in one smooth motion drew his sword and
straightened his arm to point its tip at the *tralpa*'s heart.

The Scholar-Candidate's eyes widened.  Noxy's heart skipped a beat.  She had
just enough time to think, *He really thought everyone would just do what he
said,* before someone cleared their throat behind her and said, "Excuse me,
honored?  If I may?"

Ignoring the tiger's growl of, "Not now, boy," Private Thokmay came forward to
join the sergeant and the reeve.  "Did I hear correctly that you're the king's
voice here?" he asked, his voice carrying clearly like that of an actor on
stage.

The *tralpa* nodded jerkily, his eyes fixed on the tip of the sergeant's sword.
"So you're in charge of leases on His Majesty's laws?"  Another jerky nod.
"Well, in that case..."  The young soldier fished a coin out of his pocket.
"There's a law regarding delays in application of official regulations, isn't
there---somewhere near the end of the section on procedures?  I'd like to rent
it, please."

He held out the coin.  The pudgy man gaped at him.  "What?"

"I'd like to rent that law," Private Thokmay continued doggedly.  "Just for
tonight.  That will mean the reeve isn't breaking any of the others if she waits
until tomorrow to arrest people, won't it?"

The *tralpa* looked from the boy to the sergeant's sword to the reeve and back.
"I---yes, I should think so," he replied weakly.

"Thank you, honored."  He paused.  "You have to actually take the coin for this
to be legal, don't you?"

The *tralpa* swallowed, then snatched the coin from the private's hand, picked
up his lantern, and scurried through the fortress gate.  Behind her, Noxy heard
the villagers sigh collectively with relief.

But not the sergeant.  He slammed his sword back into its sheath and turned on
Private Thokmay.  "Don't. Ever. Do. That. Again," he said, every word coming out
cold, clipped, and clear.

"Sorry, honored," Private Thokmay, startled.  "I just thought---"

"What you did is exactly what we're fighting *against*!" the sergeant snapped.
"Those laws he was holding?  They belong to everyone.  Nobody should have to pay
to use them---not here, not now, not *ever*!"

"Sorry, honored," the young soldier said, standing at attention.  "No excuse,
honored.  It won't happen again."

His mouth snapped shut as Indy stepped in front of him and held out her hand to
the sergeant.  "Give it to me.  *Now.*"

Sergeant Dorbu stared at her for a moment, then unbuckled his sword belt for a
second time and held it out.  Indy took it from him with an icy, "Thank you."
She handed it to Grappa Gas without looking at him.  "I will let your men keep
theirs," she said, her voice colder than the mountain breeze, "But only on the
understanding that there will *not* be another incident like this one.  Do we
have an understanding?"

Sergeant Dorbu dipped his head.  "My apologies, honored, I---"

"I don't want your apologies," Indy said in a low voice that sent a shiver up
Noxy's spine.  "I want you to say 'yes, honored'.  Now, do we have an
understanding?"

The sergeant straightened up.  "Yes, honored."

"Good.  Then let's all get a good night's sleep and hope that tomorrow is a
better day for all of us.  Noxy?  It's time for bed."  And with her back as
straight as any soldier's, she marched past the sergeant and the tiger's boy.
Noxy hurryied to keep up with, wondering if her mother had always been this
brave and if every sword was as heavy and awkward as the one she was carrying.

Noxy had a dream that night.  She often had dreams, or told herself stories in
her head while she was waiting to fall asleep that as often as not turned into
dreams.  Sometimes, when her stories were particularly exciting, she'd mutter
bits of dialog out loud until her mother said, "Who are you talking to?"  and
Noxy would say, "No one," and roll over and pull the blanket up under her chin
and close her eyes and carry on saving the prince from the magician or the
magician from the prince or both of them from an avalanche.

But that night's dream wasn't one of those.  She didn't swoop down at the last
moment on a cloud moments ahead of a roaring wave of snow.  She didn't do battle
with an angry pack of lightnings armed only with her courage and a magic sword
while Rash and Sensy and the rest of the village cheered her on.

No, this dream wasn't one of those. This one was troubled and strange.  The
tiger was in it, as large as a house.  The crows were in it too, but they were
skeletons decorated with feathers like the toys children made for All Ghosts'
Night and they were pecking chunks out of the people around her who were slowly
losing shape like weary clouds.

Standing in the middle of everything was the troll she had seen that morning.
It---she---had the same silver-shot fur and the same long scar, but her eyes
were like those deep shadows in the forest where the last of the winter snow
could lie unmelted until midsummer.  She waited patiently until the last of the
crows had flown away and then raised a hand in greeting.

Heart pounding, Noxy raised her own, and woke.  She lay in bed and listened to
the windchimes outside her window and the soft, rhythmic snuffle of her mother
snoring in the room below her.  Once her pulse slowed, she fumbled among the
lifetime of odds and ends on top of the two-drawer dresser beside her bed.  Her
hand closed on the little brass lamp her father had given her when she had first
started reading.  She hadn't set it out that morning to recharge it, but the
thumbnail-sized piece of dayglass inside it still gleamed when she opened its
cover.

She set it back on the dresser and fished under her pillow to pull out the knit
dolls that lay there.  Her father had made them when she was little, either to
comfort her when she was sick or as a nameday gift or just because he loved her.
She and Sensy and Rash had played with them when they were younger---they had
been pirates and cloudherds and once even pirate cloudherds, which Noxy had
declared ought to be a thing even if it wasn't.

She tucked them back under her pillow.  Her room was still big enough for her to
sit and gossip with Sensy, but the last time Rash had joined them, it had
somehow seemed much too small.

She sighed.  No matter what her mother said, she needed to talk to Sensy and
find out why she and Rash were made at each other.  *Tomorrow*, she promised
herself, reaching for the dayglass lamp and twisting the cover closed.

She held it in her hand for a second, wondering if the dayglass stopped shining
when there was nowhere for the light to go or whether the light bounced around
being reabsorbed over and over again.  Maybe that's what dreams were---ideas
bouncing around inside her head until they found a way out.  She'd have to tell
Granna Fee... in... the morning...

Moments later, the syncopated rhythm of two people snoring wafted through the
little house.

---

Noxy woke to the sound of thunder.  She rubbed the sleep from her eyes and
glanced out the window.  The sky was dawn-pale, not morning-bright, and the
thunder was Grappa Gas knocking on the door downstairs.  "Indy?  Indy, are
y'awake?"

"Just a beat while I get some clothes on," her mother called from her bedroom.
Noxy threw off her blankets, pulled on the trousers and sweater she had dropped
on the floor the night before, and hurried downstairs just as her mother opened
the door.

"They're gone," Grappa Gas said breathlessly.  "That idiot son of mine and the
*tralpa*---they're gone.  They've taken Big Blue."

"Oh, names of the saints," Indy cursed wearily.  She dragged a stool out from
under the table with her foot and let her weight fall on it.  She had bags under
her eyes, Noxy realized with a shock---she looked like she hadn't slept a wink.

Her mother noticed her look.  "Get the kettle going, would you, sweetling?  Any
idea when they left?" she continued to Grappa Gas.

The old man shook his head.  "Not long.  I stopped in to see if Rind needed
anything, and she asked if I'd seen him---said he was gone when she woke up, and
she figured he was out getting kindling or the like, but he'd been gone long
enough that she was starting to wonder.  So I went looking for him and found
this."

He held out a dew-stained sheet of paper.  Indy took it and scanned it quickly
as Noxy fed a handful of wood shavings to the stove.  "That idiot," the reeve
said.  "That self-righteous, self-pitying *idiot*."  She tossed the *tralpa*'s
note onto the table and pinched the bridge of her nose.  "The *tralpa* is going
to Duck Droppings to---what did he say?"  She picked up the letter.  "To
denounce us for our complicity in treason," she recited bitterly.  "He must have
talked Aft into flying him there.  Oh Gas, what have I done?"

Noxy stuffed a last handful of wood shavings into the stove and hugged her
mother from behind.  "It'll be all right," she said, her voice muffled in her
mother's braids.

Indy patted her arm, then took a deep breath and shrugged her off.  "Thanks,
sweetling.  I need you to put your boots on and start waking people up---get
them to the square.  The soldiers too," she added bleakly.  "And Gas, get Rind
here.  I want to find out what in the underhells her husband was thinking."

"What about the tea?" Noxy asked.

Her mother sighed.  "I don't think this is going to be a tea kind of day."

Noxy woke Rash first, then Sensy.  Both were alone in their houses, their
parents having gone with the other adults to gather the village's herd of
clouds.  She had to thump on Sensy's front door for so long to wake her that she
wound up waking the elders in the houses on either side as well, but Rash yanked
his door open almost before her knuckles hit it.  It only took her a moment to
tell each of them what had happened and send them off to start waking others.
That done, she hurried toward the trading hall that took up one entire side of
the village square.

The first thing she heard Sergeant Dorbu say when she arrived was, "I'm sorry,
honored.  I'm so sorry for all of this."  He had bags under his eyes, and Noxy
wondered if he hadn't slept.  Whenever a cloudherd died, Aft and some of the
other worshipful villagers kept vigil all night---maybe the lowlanders had the
same customs.

"Well, if we could unscramble eggs, we'd have more chickens," Indy said.  "But
honestly, I don't know what we can do now.  They have at least a couple of hours
head start, and even without that, Pillow isn't as fast as Big Blue."

"Then our race is run," Kulbinder rumbled.  He was sitting on his haunches
beside the sergeant with a tired-looking Private Thokmay at his side.  "With
respect, honored, the men aren't fit to march right now."

"March?" Sergeant Dorbu laughed wearily.  "Kulbinder, my friend, I doubt they
could walk the length of the Princes' Parade."  His jaw set.  "And even if they
could, I've no right to ask them."

*Twinge.* Noxy winced.  What was wrong with her?  And whatever it was, why did
it have to happen *now*?

Then she felt something else, like a breath of wind through distant branches or
the first faint whisper of Pillow's mind-voice two winters past when she had
first been trying to mind-speak and had almost been ready to give up because no
matter what Granna Fee said about being patient it just wasn't working and she
knew, she just *knew*, she wasn't ever going to be able to do it and then
suddenly she had heard the old cow, wordless and warm and every bit as patient
as Noxy's grandmother.  This felt like that, exactly like that, which made
Noxy's gut go cold because people weren't supposed to be able to mind-talk with
clouds unless they were touching them.

But the whisper in her head was real, and she knew that mind-voice as well as
she knew the sound of Grappa Gas's wooden leg on the cobblestones behind her.
She swallowed hard and mumbled, "Excuse me," then hurried toward the steps
nearest the front gate.

The steps lay flush against the old fortress wall wall.  They had been built for
Pilots, not human beings, so each one was as high as Noxy's knee and took her
two strides to cross.  Even after hundreds of years, the stones fit together so
snugly that it was hard to tell where one ended and the next began.

She was breathing hard by the top.  It was wide enough for three people to walk
side by side, and the parapets along its outer edges were interrupted every
dozen strides by slits, each one a slightly different shape for reasons known
only to their makers.  Half a dozen sturdy wooden stairs just in front of her
brought to a square platform high enough for her to see over the top of the
wall's outer edge.  She shaded her eyes with her hand and looked north up the
valley, already knowing what she would see.

There, coming around the first bend in the pass, was a faint smudge of white.
It was Big Blue.  She turned around and ran as fast as she could back to the
square.

"*Amma*!  *Amma!* He's coming back!"  She skidded to a stop on the cobblestones.
"Big Blue---he's coming back."

A dozen heads turned to look at her.  "What?" the tiger snarled, his ears going
back.

"It's Big Blue," Noxy insisted.  "I just saw him from the wall.  He's coming
back."  *And he only has one person on him,* she wanted to add, but there was no
way she could have seen that, not from so far away.

Half the village crowded onto the platform overlooking the cloud pen to watch
Aft bring Big Blue home.  Rind stood next to Indy, stone-faced, with a silent,
glowering Grappa Gas on her other side.

The big bull scraped wetly against the side of the ravine.  Aft hopped onto the
platform and gave the cloud one last comforting pat.  "Well," he said, "This is
more of a welcome than I was expecting."

"Where's the *tralpa*?" Indy demanded.

The cloudherd blinked.  "How would I know?"

"Don't play games," Indy said sharply.  "Where did you take him?"

Aft crossed his arms.  "I didn't take him anywhere."

"Then where in the underhells have you been?" Grappa Gas demanded.

"I went to tell everyone else what's been going on!" Aft looked from his father
to his wife to Indy.  "Got as far as the Three Sisters, but there was a pack of
lightnings further up the pass knitting a storm, a big one, so I turned around.
What's happened to the *tralpa*?"

"He's gone to Duck Droppings to tell the king's men about Sergeant Dorbu and his
men," Indy said.  "He left a note---we thought you'd taken him."

Disbelief and anger wrestled briefly on Aft's face, and anger won.  "Me!?  Why
would I do that?"

"I don't know.  Why would you go behind my back and fly off to talk to the rest
of the village?" Indy retorted hotly.

"Honoreds, forgive me," Sergeant Dorbu cut in.  He, Kulbinder, and Private
Thokmay had been standing a few steps back from the line of villagers.  Now he
stepped forward.  "If you didn't take the *tralpa*, then where is he?"

Grappa Gas made a disgusted noise in the back of his throat.  "He must be on
foot.  The idiot must be trying to hike down on his own."

"Through the forest?" Kulbinder rumbled.

"It's safe enough if you're sensible enough to stay on the paths," Indy said,
her tone making it clear exactly how sensible she thought the *tralpa* was.

"But it's three days on foot, and I'd be surprised if that pudgy goof has ever
gone more than a hundred strides off a paved road in his life," Grappa Gas
growled.  "If he trips and breaks his leg, we'll have the Pilots' own job
explaining what happened to him."

Indy nodded.  "We have to go find him."

So it was that Noxy found herself picking her way down a side trail a few
minutes later with Private Thokmay and the tiger in her wake.  "Show them the
shortcut to the fishpond," her mother had instructed her as she sent people in
twos and threes to search paths that the *tralpa* might have taken.

Noxy had nodded, still wondering how she had known that Big Blue was coming
back.  Two strides away, she'd heard Aft mutter an apology to his wife.  "I
should've told you," he'd said.

"Yes you should have," Rind had replied fiercely.  "How're we going to raise
this baby if we don't trust each other?"  Noxy had turned away, embarrassed.

The air was cold and damp in the forest gloom.  Noxy rubbed her arms to warm
herself as she walked, but Private Thokmay seemed not to notice as he studied
the greenery around them.  The tiger had disappeared into it almost as soon as
they left Stale with a growled, "Find what you can---I'll find you."

Private Thokmay raised a hand.  "There."  He pointed the forest floor in front
of them.  "See where the bush is trodden down?  Someone came through here
recently."

"If you say so," Noxy said, rubbing her arms more vigorously.  Cloudherds
learned how to read the sky almost before they learned how to read books, but
woodcraft was mystery to her.  Truth be told, she had never really liked being
in the forest.  The trees always seemed to loom over her.  It wasn't too bad
when the birds were singing, but when it was silent---

"Why is it so quiet?" she asked, suddenly realizing that she hadn't heard
anything for the last hundred heartbeats except the soft pitter-pat of water
dripping from the branches around them.

"Sh!"  Private Thokmay made a cutting gesture with his hand.  "Something's
watching us."

Noxy shivered.  "Is it the tiger?" she whispered.  Private Thokmay shook his
head.

Noxy glanced over her shoulder.  They were only a few hundred strides from the
village gate, but it felt like home and sunlight and safety were a world away.
The forest didn't want them there.  It didn't want their voices or their boots
or the metal of the sword that was somehow in Private Thokmay's hand even though
she hadn't seen him draw it.

She pressed the heels of her hands to her temples.  What was happening?  She
couldn't be mind-hearing the forest---could she?  She must be going crazy.  It
was too much---it couldn't all fit.  Her head was going to burst.

"It's too big..." Noxy whimpered.

"Sh!" Private Thokmay hissed urgently, his eyes wide.

Noxy put a hand on a nearby tree to steady herself.  The bark was cold and damp
but reassuringly solid.  The little beads of sap under her palm were frozen
nearly solid but still sticky.  She took a deep, shaky breath.  She was *not*
going to throw up.  "I'm all right," she told Private Thokmay, smiling weakly.
"Just...  just a headache."  Somewhere nearby, a sapsucker chirped uncertainly.
A squirrel chattered in response and then she heard a faint, frightened voice
calling for help somewhere in the distance.

"Did you hear that?" she whispered to Private Thokmay.  He held a fist up beside
his ear, his eyes still scanning the trees around them.

"I don't know what that means!" she whispered angrily.  "Did you hear someone?"

"No!" the young soldier whispered back.  "Now please, honored, be quiet.  I'm
sure someone is watching us."

"I don't think it's a someone," Noxy whispered, too quietly for him to hear.  "I
think it's the forest."  But that couldn't be right.  They were on a trail, near
the road that from the valley floor up to the village.  There were stumps where
trees had been taken, and they had passed the remains of a long-ago
campfire---they were far away from the depths of the Herd of Trees that human
beings were allowed to fly over but not enter.

The voice called again, fainter and more frightened than before.  "Come on!"
Noxy hurried down the mountain without waiting to see if Private Thokmay was
following or not.  She ducked low-hanging branches that dripped wetly down her
neck whenever she bumped into them and scrambled over fallen logs in varying
stages of crumbly moist decay.  Shelves of mushrooms grew on the older ones,
some as big as a kitchen table, and the ground under her boots was fragrant and
spongy with decades of fallen pine needles.

A lightning-blasted tree leaned drunkenly across the path.  She ducked under it
and pulled up short.  "Sorry!" Private Thokmay bumped into her and grabbed the
tree to steady himself, and then said, "Whoa."

The trail below them wound through the bouldered remains of an ancient rock
slide now blanketed by salal and dwarf spruce.  To their left, an impatient
little stream flung itself from pool to pool, each waterfall throwing spray into
the air for rainbows to dance on.

"Help me!" the *tralpa* shouted again.  One glance was enough to tell Noxy what
had happened.  Someone had laid a log across the stream to connect one side of
the path with the other.  The *tralpa* must have been halfway across it when one
end slipped and rolled away, leaving him perched atop the other end like a crow
sitting on a fencepost.  If he tried to shift his weight, the log would topple
over and send him tumbling down the mountain.

"You---don't just stand there, help me!" the *tralpa* shouted angrily.  His
prized leather satchel hung precariously on a stub of branch sticking out from
the log a stride below him.  Papers, half a round of cheese, and the bright
shards of several broken bottles lay scattered among the stones waiting hungrily
below him.

Private Thokmay grabbed Noxy's arm as she started forward.  "Honored, wait.
What are you planning to do?"

"Help, of course!" she said angrily, shaking him off.

"How?"  Private Thokmay nodded at the log.  "One wrong move and we'll be
lighting candles for him."

"We can't just leave him there!" Noxy protested.  "He'll freeze!"  The
Scholar-Candidate was soaked to the skin and shivering, as miserable as he was
angry.

"I know, but one slip and---" Like an actor who had been waiting for her cue,
the log slipped down the mountain.

The *tralpa* shrieked in terror, then shrieked again when the log jerked to a
stop two paces below where it had been.  "Hurry up!" he yelped in a strangled
voice.  "Get me *off* this thing *right now*!"

"We're trying, honored," Private Thokmay yelled back, clambering over a boulder
half his own height covered in damp-slick moss.  "Can you reach the branch on
your left?"

The *tralpa* didn't even look.  "No!  You have to come *get* me!"

"Yes, honored."  The young soldier muttered something under his breath that Noxy
couldn't hear over the gurgling of the waterfall.  He rose cautiously to his
feet and took a long step onto the next boulder.  "Can you get any closer?" he
asked over his shoulder as he started to unbutton his uniform jacket.

"Maybe."  Noxy picked her way carefully around the boulders, clutching at a
sword fern for balance as a stone rolled away under her boot.  She stopped three
strides from the terrified lowlander.  "I can't get any closer," she called to
Private Thokmay.

"Understood.  Hang on."  A second another long stride put him on top of a
smaller boulder half-drowned by the waterfall.

Noxy's heart went into her throat.  "Be careful!"

"Yes, honored," he muttered, "I'm trying."  He wriggled awkwardly out of his
uniform jacket, revealing only a sleeveless vest beneath it.  He was skinnier
than Noxy had realized, and started shivering the moment the wind started
scraping itself across his skin.

"I'm going to toss this to you, honored," he told the *tralpa*.  "When you get
it, hook it over that branch and then swing yourself over to that big flat rock
on your left, all right?"

The *tralpa* shook his head violently.  "You can do it, honored," the young
soldier coaxed him.  "I know you can.  Ready?  One... two... *three!*"  He
tossed his balled-up coat into the air.

The *tralpa* leaned forward and reached for it.  As he did so, the log shifted
underneath him again.  He screamed as it slid and kept sliding.  Its bottom end
caught on a stone.  It tipped forward, paused for a heartbeat, and kept going,
sending the *tralpa* flying.  "Nooooo!" he screamed.

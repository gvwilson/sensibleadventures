**Wurdi Youang / Actual minus 12,000 years**

She had given up her name long ago.
It had been heavy---too heavy to carry as deep into the Dreaming as she needed to go.
She had missed it at first,
but everyone who had known her by that name was dead now,
and it amused her when others called her the Old Woman behind her back.
At some point,
she really ought to tell them that being mostly blind didn't affect her hearing...

Footsteps crunched on the stream's gravel bank.
She sighed as the fish she had been hoping to catch darted away.
"Who's there?" she asked,
the stream caressing her knees as she turned to face whoever had frightened her dinner away.

"It's Wharru," the young man said.
"There's a stranger in camp."
He was one of the new arrivals,
still thin and angry after his long trek from the drowning lands.
His clan had lost their farms to the rising sea,
and many had been killed or enslaved.
It would be many years before he was ready to let go of the weight of that,
but he had helped realign some of her stones without complaint
and didn't snore or fart nearly as much as some of the others.

"From down below?" she asked,
sloshing through the stream to join him.

"I don't think so."
Wharru hesitated.
"He's not like any real people I've ever seen.
Alinta thinks he might be a bad spirit."

"Feh."
The old woman picked up the walking stick and skin bag
that together were half of everything she could call her own.
"Alinta thinks *everyone* is a bad spirit.
Come on, let's go meet them."

The strangers weren't in camp.
"I told him to wait for you,"
Alinta said without preamble,
her voice as sharp as the stone knife in her hand.
"I told him it's a powerful place,
you shouldn't go there without her,
you'll make the ancestors angry,
but no,
*he* wanted to see the *sunset*."
She set aside her knife,
grabbed the feet of the gweela she was dressing with one hand,
and pulled hard with the other.
The bird's skin came off 
with a sound that never failed to make the old woman's stomach turn.

The old woman sighed to herself.
The half-dozen people doing chores within earshot had paused their conversations
to listen to Alinta.
They would follow her once the old woman joined the ancestors,
and in her heart,
the old woman knew that would be the end of the stones.

She jerked her chin at the dripping carcass in Alinta's hands.
"Enough there for company?"

Alinta scowled.
"Hardly enough for *us*."

The old woman nodded.
"Well, do what you can to stretch it.
Come along."
She dug her elbow into Wharru's ribs.
"Let's go see what this evil spirit of yours wants."

They walked side by side through the long shadows beneath the gum trees.
The old woman had been going up and down that part of the mountainside for almost thirty years,
and took quiet pleasure in thinking that the packed earth was
her own footsteps echoing back at her.
Birds and insects filled the forest with sound,
and once something larger made the bushes rustle.
Wharru hesitated but the old woman pushed on.
A thylacine wouldn't attack two people together,
and no one had seen a marsupial lion in the mountains since she was a baby.

They reached the field of stones just as the sun was about to kiss the horizon.
There wasn't a cloud in the sky,
and if the stranger hadn't been there the old woman would have put Wharru to work
sighting along the stones
and marking new positions for them.

But the stranger *was* there,
and even with eyes half-blinded by years of looking too closely at the sun,
the old woman thought that for once Alinta might be right.
He was taller than any real person the old woman had ever seen
and completely hairless.
An angry young scar ran from his left temple almost to the back of his head,
rough and red against his near-black skin.

He turned as Wharru and the old woman approached him.
She blinked.
His little man was as small as a baby's and he had no bag at all that she could see.

Wurdi Youang is composed of about 100 basalt stones, including three large waist-high stones at the western end.
It is at least 11,000 years old.

**Chankillo / Actual minus 3400 years**

The Thirteen Towers near Chankillo in the Peruvian coastal desert were built about 400 BCE by the Casma/Sechin culture. The towers line up with the rising and setting sun on important days.

**Gyeongju / Actual minus 2300 years**

Cheomseongdae ("star-gazing tower") was built in the 7th century CE in the kingdom of Silla (modern-day Korea) during the reign of Queen Seondeok. It took five years to build; the number and placement of stones represents various historical and astronomical figures (e.g., the central window separates the body into 12 layers above and 12 layers below). Cheomseongdae was constructed when Queen Seondeok was still a princess; this was her first decree as a princess. Cheomseongdae was meant to share the knowledge of astronomy with everyone, rather than letting one person (Lady Misil) abuse the knowledge of it. By doing so, she also abdicated her divine rights. Because this was uncommon at the time and unsupported by many conservatives, at the opening of Cheomseongdae, barely any nobles showed up.

**Maragheh / Actual minus 1700 years**

A zij is an Islamic astronomical book that tabulates parameters used for astronomical calculations of the positions of the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets. Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Tusi (1201-74) was a Persian polymath who created very accurate tables of planetary motion, and is often credited with establishing trigonometry as a discipline in its own right (and possibly a precursor to Copernicus via uncredited work). Hulagu Khan created an observatory for Tusi at Maragheh in the 13th century. The facility became inactive in the 14th century after losing patronage, and was ruined by a series of earthquakes. The contents of its library were stolen during the Mongol invasion, but the remains inspired Ulugh Beg to construct an observatory in Samarkand in 1428.

**Uraniborg / Actual minus 1400 years**

Uraniborg was built between 1576 and 1580 on the island of Hven by Tycho Brahe, then expanded to Stjerneborg after it turned out that tower-mounted instruments swayed too much in the wind. Brahe abandoned the site in 1597 after he fell out of favor with the Danish king Christian IV; it was destroyed in 1601. It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe.

**Mathura / Actual minus 1145 years**

A "Jantar Mantar" is a giant sundial with a triangular gnomon whose hypotenuse is parallel to the Earth's axis. On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle parallel to the plane of the equator. The instrument can measure the time of day to an accuracy of half a second. "Yantra mantar" means "calculation instrument". There were five, but the one in Mathura was torn down just before the Revolt of 1875 (possibly just neglect and scavenging).

**Arecibo / Actual minus 979 years**

The Arecibo Radio Observatory was completed in 1963; it was 305m in diameter and made out of 38,778 perforated aluminum panels. It collapsed on Dec 1, 2020 after years of dwindling funding. (CE 2041)

**L5 / Actual minus 895 years**

Deep space observatory in the L5 Lagrange point, 105 years from now, gets data, Secondary realizes that rebuilding is more important, sabotages mission and returns to Earth.

**L5 / Actual**

Returned to Earth, devastated by climate change, helping with rebuilding.

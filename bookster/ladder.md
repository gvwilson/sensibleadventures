Mayeule smiled.  "Whole town knows about it."  Vurt's "ladder" was a
chain of climbing anchors, cleverly concealed loops of rope, and
sturdy bamboo rungs that ran from his verandah down to the base of the
mountain.  A goat couldn't have climbed it, but a man couldâ€“even a
one-legged man, if he was patient and careful, and as a matter of
principle didn't want to pay the captain's duty on a pack full of
Bantangui spices.  Each time the mountain berthed, Vurt reassembled
the top fifty strides of his private connection to the world below and
visited like-minded businessmen on the ground below.  He told himself
that he did it to set a little aside for his grandchildren.  Only on
the darkest nights, when he missed his long-gone wife the most, did he
admit to himself that it was because he'd never really believed a
mountain could fly.

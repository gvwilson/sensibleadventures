# Iffy

- Problem: China is too conventional a villain these days
  - Replace China with Pokhara (a city in Nepal) and tell the history of how it was taken over by the Chinese and then by AI
- Problem: the politics is murky
  - Antarctica is still officially neutral ground
  - Aussies and Zillions struggling for supremacy
    - Make "A to Z" joke
  - Human politics feels like children shoving each other on the playground while the grownups (AIs) look on
    - Wales: "Hard to understand why people make a big deal about it"
    - Johel responds furiously at his privilege
  - Behind that is the AI politics, which is only revealed at the end
    - Humans are on the road to extinction
    - Nova Zembla doesn't want that and is willing to risk its own extinction
    - Pokhara isn't willing to risk it
    - The two are evenly balanced
- Problem: there isn't a clearly defined villain
  - Captain of the *Taroona* needs to become a minor villain
    - Arrange another encounter in Halley to up tension before the hunt at sea
    - And a final encounter in Rothera (the captain survived the sinking and is out for revenge)
    - Give the captain a name
  - Governor is the larger villain
    - There are three clones who are supposed to sync up regularly
      - Johel: "The technology is lost"
      - Wales (sharply): "No, we just don't have the tools to build more"
    - Governor Stern Paddington is "retired" (lost a political fight and is mostly powerless)
    - Governor Stern Halley and Governor Stern Rothera are struggling for supremacy behind the scenes
    - Stern Halley is allied with the Aussies, who are OK with mining and coal smuggling
    - Stern Rothera is lining up with the Zillions for lack of alternatives
      - Wales: "The Congolese are sitting this one out"
    - Wales brings his proposition to Stern Halley, who sends him to Stern Rothera
      - Has to send him because they aren't brain-sharing reliably any longer (but are still pretending)
      - Stern Halley thinks the attack is Stern Rothera
      - Find out later that it was Wales aided by Nova Zembla
        - At least, he *thinks* he was aided: human beings have created things they can't understand any more than they can control
        - Wales: "We do that a lot..." (referring to ecosystem damage and children alike)
  - So why does Stern Halley send the *Taroona* after Wales?
    - Doesn't: the captain of the *Taroona* wants to steal Wales' gear
    - Make a remark about Aussies being descended from convicts and returning to form (pirates born and bred)
    - Iffy: "How do you keep it all straight?" (meaning the politics)
    - Wales: "Practice."
  - Attack on Rothera really is Stern Rothera
    - It's the start of the civil war

--------------------

- captain of the *Taroona* is the minor villain
- turns out that the governor is the major villain
- wants access to the Niobium satellites so that he can force China-over-the-Sea to incorporate him
  - China will take anyone, but they stop being themselves
  - the governor wants to be in it but not part of it
  - the satellites are his bargaining network
  - Governor: "This world is beyond saving. I want to see what comes next."
- Iffy used to see Zillions in the market, but not any more
  - they stay by the docks and they stay in groups to stay safe
- a Chinese chipmonk waiting patiently for customers outside the market
  - they always said that people were never joined against their will, but you had to be pretty desperate to trust them
- so when they reach Paddington, they have to escape from the Governor
- the Governor is on his third body
  - brings up the display (somewhat ostentatiously) to intimidate visitors during their first meeting
  - imprints himself on clones
  - process is never perfect: more an attitude than knowledge
  - Doctor Johel (wearily): "I've done worse things. For worse reasons."
- the Zillion attack at sea isn't Zillions
  - it's the captain of the *Taroona* in a lifeboat after revenge

- give Iffie some friends
  - hard-won (she's not completely isolated)
  - Jeep is her best friend, and has a crush on her that she hasn't noticed
  - she's in love with Honesty
  - she's angry when her connection to the jungle is cut off and she can't speak to them: she'd worked so hard to make friends
  - talk about "putting on makeup" when making a video call (digital)
    - she's never learned how to use the real thing
  - "vee you later"

- "Don't be an app"

- call the internet "the jungle"
  - Wales comments that it's the only one left

- Jeep is with the Marines when they reach Paddington, re-inducted
  - mention in the opening that he hasn't been right since his first induction
  - post-induction stress disorder (PISD) which Uncle Jack jokes isn't as good as being pissed

- more discussion of the rest of the world
  - 'Merica's drowned cities
  - the superstorm wasteland that had once been Russia's fertile fields
  - Muslims from China-over-the-Sea doing the pilgrimage to Mecca in envirosuits

- people don't use VR because of the risk of (mental) infection
  - being matrixed

- Wales is going to ask the governor for a favor
  - Uncle Jack: "Who are you to ask th' governor for a favor?"
  - Wales smiles a bit sadly. "It's not really a favor, it's more of a down payment."

- On train: can't say they raced through the night, since it was always afternoon, but that's what it felt like
  - Through the Scrape to the ice (dozens of little nameless rivers on the way)

- Wales wakes up the mulcher
  - Iffy finds a picture of him in the cab with other people
  - Wales is injured again, more severely - needs Iffy's help to get to the base

- Wales is two hundred and fifty years old
  - Tweaked for space travel, but by the time he was grown, people weren't going into space any more
  - Worked in Johel's grandmother's lab
  - Not trying to control satellites: trying to send a message back in time via quantum entanglement
  - Wales goes into the base
  - Big explosion

- Iffy returns to Paddington
  - The _Guinevere_ seems so small and dirty now
  - Iffy flips through her nature book, notices a scrawl she'd never seen before
  - "Got the same spam today as everyone else - some guy claiming he's from the future and that the world is going to melt"
  - "Like, who doesn't know that, and anyway, what am _I_ supposed to do about it?"
  - Iffy realizes that people can't fix the past (her parents, the world), but they _can_ make the future better
  - Goes back to the shopkeeper that Aunt Naggie spoke to (a Zillion spy) and signs up

- Bharati fire was Wales
  - An earlier attempt to get to the base on his own
  - Foiled by China

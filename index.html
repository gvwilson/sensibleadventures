<td valign="top"><strong>Greg Wilson</strong> was born and raised on Vancouver Island, where it rains so much that people get a rust rather than a tan. He lived in Scotland for seven years, and after trying out a few other countries, decided to settle in Toronto. He is now married to a wonderful woman, and they have an especially wonderful daughter. When heâ€™s not trying to get her to eat her vegetables (his daughter, that is), he teaches people how to program. When he's not doing <em>that</em>, he writes stories. If you'd like to know more, you can reach Greg by <a href="mailto:greg@sensibleadventures.com">email</a>, or <a href="http://third-bit.com">visit</a> <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">his</a> <a href="http://aosabook.org">other</a> <a href="http://neverworkintheory.org">sites</a> (which are mostly about programming).</td>

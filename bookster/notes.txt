- takes way too long to get going
- just enough focus on other people to distract
- hard to keep Chaentelle and Que√ßenne straight (lose one)
- turn Piaerre into Erileine, and make Iseulle a boy
- make Elaiene's sides more consistent (she flips between sympathy for the Hett and criticism)
- "I think you broke my jaw" - scene seems pointless
- add a rockslide (what does it reveal?)
- add a riot in Forecastle
- Vaszlav is a tinker, not a bookseller (only the Hett work iron)
- there isn't a villain until too late: need a bad guy early on
- "It's not like he knit her a sweater or anything" and then there's a sweater at the funeral

## Chapter 5

"I will *not* go *anywhere* until I've done some shopping!" Aunt Naggie said
emphatically, straightening her back like a soldier expecting to be shot.
"Because if I do, you'll be the first one to complain."

For a moment Iffy was sure Uncle Jack would explode again, but to her surprise
he backed down. "Fine," he snapped, waving her away. "You go get whatever we
need. I'm gonna look at th' engine an' see what th' sainted *Mister Wales* has
gaffled up. And take th' girl with you," he added over his shoulder as he
stalked away. "Had enough o' her underfoot for one day."

Aunt Naggie slumped and took a deep breath. "Good on you," Iffy said, punching
her lightly in the shoulder.

Her aunt smiled shakily. The Marines had driven them back to the pier with
strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened at the governor's mansion.
The fact that the feeds on the *Guinevere*'s screens were talking about nothing
else didn't seem to matter. Half of Antarctica seemed to think it was a
stealthy first strike by the Zillions---or second, if the feeder was counting
the explosion at the quarantine shed in Halley. The other half was convinced
the machines were about to rise again, either on their own or with the backing
of whatever networked hypermind currently ruled China-over-the-Sea. Iffy's
heart sank at grainy video of a crowd armed with pulse guns and cutting torches
chasing a maintenance bot through the streets of Paddington hundreds of
kilometers away. It wasn't French Henry, but it would be soon if things didn't
calm down.

It only took Aunt Naggie a minute to gather up a trio of sturdy mesh bags and an
ancient handheld piece of tech that she swore would tell them if anything was
toxic. Iffy slipped a few of her smaller tools into a waistbelt under her
coat---if she was lucky, someone in the market would have mending work she could
do for a few rand while Aunt Naggie hunted for onions, soy, and noodles.

After dragging a brush through her close-cropped hair and watching sternly while
Iffy, under protest, did the same, Aunt Naggie strode down the gangplank with
her adopted daughter in her wake. One of the Marines listened patiently as Aunt
Naggie explained where she was going and why. As she launched somewhat
breathlessly into the details of her shopping list, he held up a hand to stop
her. "Get whatever you need," he said, handing her a black-edged money card.
"But keep in mind that Finance will charge things back to you if it thinks
they're luxuries." He glanced pointedly over her shoulder at Uncle Jack, whose
plan for looking at the engine seemed to consist of leaning on the *Guinevere*'s
railing and scowling at everyone and everything.

Rothera's streets were busy but not crowded. Its older stores clustered along
the harborfront like gulls standing just out of reach of the waves, their signs
bigger and brighter than those in Halley. Familiar cartoon characters and
celebrities from far-off Australia beckoned, danced, pouted, and cracked jokes
as people walked by. Iffy would have gone in to each one, but Aunt Naggie
hurried past them, her expression set. She regarded shopping as a competitive
sport, and clearly had no intention of letting Rothera beat her.

The city's main market had originally been an aircraft hangar. A century ago,
someone with more money than sense had added a spun glass floor two stories
above the ground. Their attempt to turn the building into "The Big South's
Biggest, Bestest Dance Hall!!" had failed almost immediately. After a couple of
unsuccessful attempts to oust the squatters who took it over after the war (many
in possession of surplus weapons, combat conditioning, and radical political
ideas), the governor and Rothera's core had thrown up their physical and
metaphorical hands and let anyone who could pay two rand a month set up a stall.
Still called the Dance Hall, it was the biggest surveillance-free zone in
Antarctica, and reminded Iffy of nothing so much as the picture of an anthill in
her older's nature book.

Aunt Naggie tapped her money card on the reader held out by the bored Marine at
the door to pay her ten pence admission fee and squared her shoulders. Noticing
Iffy's yearning look back toward the docks, she nudged her foster daughter with
her elbow. "Why'n't you go off an' see what you can find? Or who, if you've a
mind to?" she added teasingly.

Iffy felt her cheeks go warm. "Y' sure y' don' need me?"

Aunt Naggie looked around. Greenhouse potatoes hung in net bags next to stacks
of dried fruit in single-molecule shrink wrap. Burlap sacks of Cape Town rice
piled higher than Iffy was tall threatened to topple onto a line of people
gossiping with each other as they waited their turn to buy ginger, cardamom,
and bay leaves from a one-legged woman whose tweaked hair that sparkled red and
purple every time she turned her head. A surgical bot that had been converted
for tailoring stood motionless, its four skeletal arms at its sides, while a man
with a shaven head and an enormous beard struggled into a coat that was still a
size too small for him. "I'll be fine," Aunt Naggie said, as happy as Iffy ever
saw her.

Ten minutes later Iffy turned the corner onto Rocking Horse Street and hurried
toward a stubby never-finished canal that Rothera's mechanics had taken over to
use as a repair yard. A sleek Marine cutter was tied up on one side while
crab-like bots scrambled over its hull to scrape off the weaponized barnacles
that would, if left unchecked, slowly devour the fractal carbon that made it
nearly frictionless. Iffy would normally have stopped to watch, but right then
she had other things on her mind.

She slowed to a walk as she approached the end of the canal. Her heart sank.
Two women were working side by side in the salvage booth, but both were too old
to be who she was hoping to see.

"Hey, Iffy!" She whirled around just in time to be caught up in an enormous
hug. "Hey," Honesty said more softly, her cheek pressed against Iffy's. "Micka
tol' me she tuck y'all come in, an' then I twitched what happen up along th'
governor's. I's worried along by you."

Iffy returned the hug awkwardly. She always felt awkward around Honesty,
especially when they were close enough that she could smell whatever flowery
concoction the other girl used to wash her hair, but it was a good kind of
awkward, a *really* good kind that she couldn't stop thinking about.

"I'm fine," she said, her voice muffled slightly by the fake rat fur collar on
Honesty's coat. She slithered free of the hug and took a step back. "I'm
fine," she repeated. "It was just some bots gone rogue."

"Just some bots?" Honesty repeated disbelievingly. "Din't looka that on th'
news. Looka th' war come back 'round!"

"It wasn't all that," Iffy said dismissively. Honesty had changed the tattoos
on her cheeks again, she noticed. And she'd done some more embroidery on the
cuffs of her coat to match.

"But what happen? I mean, really happen, not just official happen?" Honesty
slipped her arm through Iffy's as if it was the most natural thing in the world
and steered her toward her family's workshop at the end of the canal.

Iffy felt into step alongside her, desperately hoping her friend couldn't hear
her heart thudding in her chest. Honesty---properly, Honesty's Third, but only
her olders called her that---was three years her senior. She had been singing
on a street corner across from the Dance Hall the first time Iffy saw her. She
hadn't meant to stop, but then Honesty caught her eye and smiled in the middle
of a chorus without missing a beat. They'd only spent time together half a
dozen times since then, but each time had been---

"Sorry?" she said belatedly.

Honesty rolled her eyes. "I *said*, why're you up along there? You gettin'
fancy or some?"

"I ain't never gettin' fancy!" Iffy protested automatically, her accent
thickening unconsciously to match her friend's. "We just kinda got dragged inta
things." She summarized the last few days as briefly as she could, skating past
what had happened to the Zillion ship and her part in assembling the bot that
had saved them at the mansion. She still didn't want to think about that...

Even with those gaps, her story left Honesty wide-eyed. "Tay bangle, that's a
real adventure, innit?" She bumped her hip against Iffy's, but her tone turned
serious as she nodded at the Marine cutter under repair beside them. "So's that
why we got th' ganky to finish up this 'un? 'Cuz my First, she thought we had a
coupla weeks f'r it, but the blues come along day b'fore last an' said we gotta
be crannup t' sail soonest."

Iffy swallowed drily. Two days past was the day Wales had made the sea boil and
sent the *Taroona* to the bottom. "Yeah, prolly," she mumbled.

Honesty bumped her hip against Iffy again. "Good," she said firmly. "'Cuz they
payin' up'n'all, an' we can use the jing. Second wants t' make another li'
sister," she confided with a grin. "Wou'nt that be a thing? Now c'mon---I bet
there's tea brewa." She unhooked her arm from Iffy's and took the younger
girl's hand.

Iffy's mind whirled. Another clone? It made sense---Honesty had just turned
sixteen, so she and a younger clone would be spaced far enough apart to be on
the right side of legal---but... Before she blurt out any of the dozen
questions swirling around in her head, Honesty squeezed her fingers painfully
hard and shot her a warning sidelong glance.

Iffy's mouth snapped shut. Thumb, middle finger, first finger, middle finger...
She almost stumbled as she recognized the code that resistance fighters had
developed to hide their words from surveillance during the robot wars, and that
children now used to keep secrets from adults. Little finger and fourth finger
together, middle finger, middle and fourth... The words and letters took shape
in her head as Honesty tapped them out. The blues were watching. They had left
some cheese behind (no, that didn't make any sense, Honesty must have meant some
cameras), so they had to be careful what they said.

There was no point trying to spot the cameras---they could be as small as grains
of sand. Each would pass information to its equally small neighbors in
low-energy bursts of not-quite-static until it reached whatever bored Marine had
been told to keep an eye on the repair yard. A core would have done a better
job---it wouldn't get bored or doze for just a moment despite its induction
conditioning---but if the governor ever used cores for surveillance, he'd have a
riot on his hands.

She squeezed Honesty's hand twice to signal that she understood, but when she
loosened her grip, Honesty tightened hers. Iffy waited for more taps. When
they didn't come, she realized that her friend was sending a different kind of
message. She walked the last hundred meters to the workshop with a dazed smile
on her face that would have made her aunt sigh happily.

Honesty's First and Second looked up and said, "G'day," simultaneously as
Honesty pulled aside the splotched canvas curtain that hung in the salvage
booth's doorway. "You gi'n her th' bad news yen?" her First asked in an accent
as strong as the tea she poured for Iffy without asking.

Honesty pouted. "I's gonna!"

"Sorry," her First said unapologetically. Her Second looked up from her
workbench long enough to grin. Her magnifying glasses made her eyes look
cartoon-huge in a face that showed how beautiful Honesty's would be in the years
to come.

"What bad news?" Iffy asked.

"My call-up came 'long yesterday," Honesty said reluctantly. "Whole buncha folk
'long the docks got 'em. We gotta do induction t'night."

Iffy's stomach flip-flopped. "Tonight?" *But I just got here!* she thought
despairingly.

Honesty shrugged, settling herself on a stool next to the square meter of
workbench where she salvaged the easier bits and pieces of tech that came her
family's way. "Yeah. Lotsa folk are wonderin' why the quaddy quaddy, but the
blues ain't sayin' bunga 'cept that it come along straight from th' governor.
Figure it's got somethin' to do with th' bots going gonjy 'long yesterday?"

"I dunno," Iffy said. Anger suddenly welled up inside her. Jeep had *changed*
when the Marines pumped their rules and tactics into his head. What would it do
to her friend? "Seems like I don't know nothin' these days."

"Aw, that ain't true," Honesty's First said. Her face and smile were more
practiced versions of her grand-younger's. Where Honesty had temporary tattoos,
her First had whorling blue lines that turned the scars left by some long-ago
accident into something like art. She tossed the piece of tech she had been
cleaning to Iffy. "Any gunna what that's for?"

Iffy caught it and turned it over in her hands. It was made of metal, and
heavier than she'd have guessed. Microparticles of ocean plastic had worked
themselves into its tiny intricate gears, giving it the all-too-familiar soapy
feel of age and neglect. The different kinds of plastic would have welded to
each other to weave a hard fractal mass through the gears that couldn't be
pulled out of them without damaging their tiny micro-precise teeth. It would
take hours of patient work with ice, acid, tweaked bacteria, and
micro-manipulators to tease it all apart, and at the end all they'd have would
be---

"It's a differential separator pump," she told Honesty's First as shapes and
clues came together in her head to form an answer as clear as it was impossible
for her to know. "Prolly hooks up to a centrifuge or somethin' for filterin'
blood durin' surgery."

"'Zat so?" Honesty's First said, impressed. She caught the part when Iffy
threw it back to her and passed it to her Second, who studied it for a moment,
shrugged as if to say, "Could be," and set it on the to-do rack that lined the
wall behind the workbench. "How 'bout these?"

The box she passed to Iffy opened to reveal squares woven from fractal carbon
fiber, each the size of her nature book and as thin as half a dozen pages
together. It took her a second to realize that the little grommets patterned
across the squares were rotors, and that each square was some kind of flexible
dronelet. She turned one over in her hands. "Dunno," she admitted. "How d'you
switch it on?"

"No idea," Honesty's First said cheerfully. "Best guess is they was fer some
kinda game."

"Shaw," her Second said, looking up from the machine she had spent the last
three days trying to clean and reassemble. "They's too fine jarra game. I's
fer they bin up some kinda survey mappin'."

"Mebbe," Honesty's First admitted. Casually, looking past Iffy rather than at
her, she asked, "You ain't got fra yer...notions?"

Iffy shook her head. She had told Honesty about her occasional flashes of
insight, then told her off, cold and hard, when she learned that her friend had
relayed what she'd said to her First and Second. "We don't keep secrets on
achother," Honesty had said with a shrug. "Y'ain't aright along that, best we
part ways now." So Iffy had forgiven her, secretly relieved that her best and
only friend knew she was different but didn't seem to care.

When Iffy handed back the box of dronelets, Honesty's First waved her away.
"Not much use t'us if we can't turn 'em on," she said, though Iffy knew the
little rotors would be worth a meal if they were pried out and sold as parts.
"If anythin' comes t' mind, you come by an' gi's a scutch, aright? An' even if
nothin' does, we's alluz happy t'have one more fer dinner or a sleepover." She
winked broadly.

"Thanks," Iffy mumbled. Her upbringing had taught her how to rig sails in heavy
weather and mend engines older than her foster parents, but not what to do when
people were kind to her. She drained the last of her tea. "I oughta get back
t' help Aunt Naggie an' th' shopping."

"Sure," Honesty said. "But you'll come along after an' eat?" She poked Iffy in
the ribs. "Y'always maw skinny."

Iffy blushed. "I'll ask," she said, mumbling again.

Honesty hooked her arm through Iffy's again. "Bonza. I'll walk you out."

They held hands all the way up the canal. As usual, Honesty did most of the
talking. When her induction notice arrived, she had fired back a message right
away, and wouldn't you know it, she had to finish the last of her schoolwork
anyway, which was *so* unfair. Anyway, what was the point? She knew tons more
about salvaging old tech than the crufty old core that was supposed to be
teaching her, and whatever she didn't know, she could learn from her First and
Second or from Iffy, right?

"I s'pose," Iffy allowed.

"Oh c'mon." Honesty bumped her hip against Iffy's. "M' First and Uncle Osman
'long by Pier Nine asked two different cores about that first piece she showed
you. They neither had a siggy what it was, an' then you jus' come right out an'
tell 'em. The stuff you have in your head," she finished admiringly, shaking
her own in wonder.

*I'd feel better about it if I knew how it got there,* Iffy thought. For the
thousandth time she wondered if her clone parents had been able to do what she
could---if they had thought of it as a gift or a burden or both. And for the
thousandth time, she wished she could ask them.

They said goodbye by the bow of the Marine cutter. One of the repair bots
paused a moment to watch them kiss, its simple-minded core wondering who was
repairing whom, then erased the thought as Iffy hurried back into town to the
Dance Hall and her aunt.

The streets around the market were crowded by the time Iffy got there. Four
Indonesian Mormons handed out glossy animated pamphlets advertising their
church's insurance policies, smiling forgiveness at a ragged man yelling that
the Singularity had come, they were all living in a simulation, the data proved
it, they just had to look at the data and they would see the truth! A bot with
a rasping voice and an ancient plastic mask for a face told stories to a circle
of wide-eyed children. Its cut-out paper puppets danced as Zuko battled
Princess Leia while his boyfriend Aang struggled to free Elsa from the evil
robot Wintermute. Two bald women who might have been twins but were probably
just clones wheeled a cartful of blankets woven from tweaked moss past two men
arguing beside another cart piled high with curved sheets of diamond that cast
quivering rainbows on the ground. The smell of soy being fried in ginger mixed
with the wet steamy warmth from rice cookers, the salty tang of tweaked seaweed
being boiled into soup, and the smell of people who washed when they could.

Iffy paused longingly in front of a stall selling rats with startling blue eyes.
"They make great pets. Or snacks!" the man said, hastily adding, "Just
kidding! Just kidding!" when Iffy scowled at him. "And look!" He leaned over
and said, "Ratty want a cracker?"

"Idjit!" the rat squeaked back. "Yer an idjit!"

"See?" the man said proudly. "You can teach 'em a coupla hunnert words, easy!"

"I know," Iffy said wistfully, a sudden unexpected pang in her heart. She held
her finger a few millimeters in front of one of the cages. The rat sniffed at
it. "Idjit," it pronounced in its tiny squeaky voice.

*One day*, Iffy promised herself as she straightened up and hurried on her way.
One day, when she had a workshop of her own and she could keep whatever pets and
plants she wanted and Honesty could come by all the time. (Even in her
daydreams, she didn't dare imagine that they would live together.) One
day---but not today.

The Dance Hall was just as busy inside as out. Iffy tried slipping through the
crush the way Honesty somehow did, then gave up and resigned herself to moving
at the pace of the meandering crowd. She glanced up as a drone the size of her
hand whined by, its dozen crystal eyes scanning the crowd. "Some all got they
riled up," a stall keeper muttered, noticing Iffy's look. "They 'long by all
place today. You t'ink it be come by they fight up along th' gov'nor's?"

"I dunno," Iffy said. Drones had microphones as well as cameras, and the last
thing she wanted was some stray word of hers catching the governor's attention.
"'Scuse me." She ducked under a tarnished video carpet hanging from a
clothesline and pushed her way into the crowd on the other side.

And froze. And ducked back behind the video carpet again. She squeezed her
eyes shut. She must have been mistaken---she couldn't have seen what she
thought she just saw. She shook her head and slowly peeked around the carpet's
edge.

There, just a couple of meters away, stood Aunt Naggie and a trim Asian man in a
patched brown and gray uniform of the old Ecological Corps. Iffy couldn't hear
what they were saying over the bustle of the crowd, but from the way they were
looking into each others' eyes she was pretty sure they weren't discussing
topsoil formation.

The ecologist handed Aunt Naggie something and leaned forward to kiss her on the
cheek. The space above their heads flickered as he did so. It was another
video carpet, Iffy realized, strung between four posts like a canopy to conceal
them from the drones overhead. It flickered again as Aunt Naggie pulled the man
closer and kissed him for real.

Iffy's stomach flip-flopped the way it did when she read some of the steamier
passages in the romances Aunt Naggie loved so much. The ecologist stepped back,
a bland smile replacing the genuine warmth of a moment before. He gestured at
one of the carpets hanging on a display rack beside him. "Perhaps this one?"
he asked a little too loudly.

Aunt Naggie's reply was cut off by a sudden crackle of static. "Citizens!" The
stern mechanical voice cut through the market bustle. "Remain where you are!
There is no cause for alarm! This safety notice is brought to you by Volkov's
Hot Sauce!"

A high-pitched alarm began to ping. The ecologist looked up as the drone that
Iffy had seen earlier buzzed lower, then glanced toward the entrance at the
sound of boots and angry shouts. A squad of Marines in exoskeletons were
clanking through the crowd, visors down and shock sticks in their hands.

"Citizens! Remain where you are! And try Volkov's---there's nothing hotter
this side of the Cairo Crater!" The drone jinked sideways to dodge a thrown
scrap of bamboo. Something clanged off a Marine's exoskeleton. Someone
shouted, "Show us yer warrant 'r show us your backside!" Other voices took up
the cry. "Show us yer warrant!"

*Great,* Iffy thought, *Another affin' dock fight.* She pulled aside the carpet
she had been hiding behind and hurried toward Aunt Naggie just in time to hear
the ecologist say, "Please, you should go."

Whatever Aunt Naggie might have replied was cut off by the sight of her foster
daughter. "Iffy?" she gasped. "What're you doin' here?"

"Came lookin' for you," Iffy said breathlessly. She nodded at the ecologist.
"H'lo. I'm---"

"---Fifth of Ang Kwan," he finished, bowing slightly. "It's a pleasure to meet
you. Nagatha has told me a great about you."

"Hasn't told me anything about *you*," Iffy said, immediately regretting her
attempt to be flippant.

But the ecologist simply smiled. "That's probably for the best."

"But Iffy, you ain't supposed t' be here!" Aunt Naggie said helplessly. "I
thought you were down along th' docks?"

"I was," Iffy said defensively. "What's goin' on?"

"They're after someone," the ecologist said calmly. He put his hand on Aunt
Naggie's arm. "You have to go. Nagatha, you have to."

Aunt Naggie dug in her heels. "No." She took hold of the ecologist's hand.
"It ain't safe for you here no more."

"*Im awa pfa ta,*" he muttered under his breath. "Fine." He pulled a bright
orange knit cap out of a pocket of his old uniform jacket and pulled it low over
head ears, then shrugged out of the jacket and tossed it aside. "You two head
for Bower Street. I'll get to the door by Alphabet Alley and see you at
the---at the grocery," he finished, catching himself.

Aunt Naggie hesitated. *That ain't gonna work,* Iffy thought. The drones
overhead weren't allowed to be any smarter than seagulls, but even something
that dumb could recognize the way someone walked, and the ecologist's cap wasn't
doing anything to cover his face. If any of the drones caught a glimpse of
them---

"Wait!" Iffy pulled the box that Honesty's First had given her out of her
pocket. "C'mon c'mon c'mon," she muttered. "Please, just this once." She had
never been able to control her flashes of intuition. They came when they
wanted. This was a stupid idea. They should be running. They should---

And there it was. How could she not have seen it before? There and there
together and then there, two presses and a third, and *zip!* A thin film in the
center of the dronelet peeled back to reveal a foil battery, a hair-thin fractal
antenna, and---

"*Shway boo*," she whispered unbelievingly. The dronelet's crystal core was
twice the size of a grain of rice, and its flat, unreflective black surface
meant it had probably been grown in orbit. If the other dronelets had similar
cores, then together they would be worth enough for Iffy to outfit an entire
workshop.

"Iffy, what're you doin?" She ignored her foster mother and the alarms and the
pressure of the ecologist's stare as she pulled tools out of her pockets.

"You got any scraps this big?" she asked over her shoulder, holding her hands a
few centimeters apart.

"Here." He handed her half a dozen swatches of video fabric, each the size of a
handkerchief. Iffy measured one against a dronelet, then winced as she pried
two of the rotors out of the stiff black fabric. She'd never be able to repair
the damage, not even with the kind of tech she'd seen in Wales' toolboxes, but
she didn't dare cutting into the dronelet fabric itself.

It took her a moment to tuck the corners of the video square into the holes
she'd made. Now for the hard part. She closed her eyes and willed the images
to come together. These bits were the dronelets---don't worry now about how she
knew or why she could see its programming as clearly as she could see its
hardware---and this over here was the video square, and that was its connection
to the outside world, so if she shone a laser *here* and sent a pulse-coded
access request, then told the dronelet and the video square to trust each other
no matter what their other programming said, then---

"Gotcha!" The dronelet rose, tilted, and levelled as the image on its back
flickered and steadied to show the top of a woman's head.

The Asian ecologist grunted. "She really can, can't she?" he said to Aunt
Naggie.

Iffy's foster mother nodded. "Y'aright?" she asked Iffy.

"I'm fine," Iffy lied. Her head was swimming. Everything around her seemed
unreal. The stalls were just wireframes. Her dronelets were clouds of
software, patched and patched again to defend against viruses until there was
only room for the most limited intelligence. It was like a badly-written sim.

"Iffy!" Aunt Naggie shook her. The world blinked back to normal. "Iffy,
c'mon, we gotta go."

"Gimme a minute!" Eighty-five seconds later, two more awkward patch-ups were
humming quietly in the air beside her, each showing a different downloaded
image. She took a deep breath and transmitted one last set of instructions.

The patches of video fabric flickered. The images solidified to show top-down
views of Iffy, Aunt Naggie, and someone whom she hoped looked enough like the
ecologist to convince a drone. "Start walkin'," she ordered the two adults.
"Just a coupla steps. Aright, that's enough." *I hope,* she added to herself.

She strung a few more commands together and threw them into the dronelets'
cores. They began to sway slightly in an unconvincing imitation of the way
people moved when walking. "Which way's Alphabet Alley?" she asked.

A few moments later the dronelets were out of sight, on their way north with
(Iffy hoped) the hunting drones on their trail. She, Aunt Naggie, and the
ecologist hurried in the opposite direction. As they turned left by a rack of
bicycles and a stall selling rolls of microfiber sailcloth, a man in front of
them asked, "Ya pins they trappa thief?"

"Net says they's sweepin' fer some kinda sab," the woman beside him replied,
scanning a feed only she could see through heavy yellow-tinted glasses.

Her companion snorted. "Bad case o' someone din't pay off the blues is more
likely." His companion shushed him.

Even as she did so, the drones above boomed, "Citizens! We require your
assistance! Please remain calm, and remember, Volkov's makes it vetter!"

"Guess they got their warrant," the man in front of Iffy muttered.

Every screen in the Dance Hall blanked for an instant. When they came back to
life, every one showed a younger version of the ecologist. Instead of a suit,
he was wearing the green and gold uniform of the Brazilian Defense Co-operative.

"You're a Zillion?" Iffy gasped.

The ecologist pulled his arm out of Aunt Naggie's. "Keep walking," he ordered,
yanking the orange knit cap off his head. Without waiting for a reply he turned
right toward a stall selling animated toys and compact ship-board cooking
equipment.

A pair of Marines stepped out from behind it. One raised a shock stick as the
other levelled a tangle gun. "Citizen! Halt!" they said in unison.

The ecologist threw himself to the side, tossing his cap into the air. It
exploded in a dazzling cloud of orange stars just as the Marine's tangle gun
burped a web of sticky plastic microfibers. People shrieked. The shot went
wide, the gun's auto-sight dazzled by the ecologist's counter-measures.

The couple in front of Iffy and Aunt Naggie fell heavily to the ground, shouting
and struggling as the tangle net tightened around them. The ecologist vaulted
over a counter-top, knocked a wok full of steaming noodles aside, and pulled up
short as another pair of Marines clanked around the corner to block his way.

"Iffy, c'mon, we gotta go!" Aunt Naggie tugged her arm.

Iffy shook her off, tapping frantically at her keypad. There! Her three
dronelets zipped through the air straight for the Marines. They spun around,
their inducted reflexes pulling their weapons up in the face of an unknown new
threat just long enough for the ecologist to look wildly around for another way
out.

But there wasn't one. Two---no, three---of the Marines' drones were buzzing
overhead. The first Marine chambered another stubby round in his tangle gun and
raised it.

The ecologist turned to face Aunt Naggie. "Start where you are," he said. "Use
what you have, help who you can." He clenched his hand to make a fist and
pressed it against his temple. As Aunt Naggie shrieked "no!" the lights around
them flickered. The ecologist's head snapped back and he collapsed like a
puppet whose strings had been cut.

Iffy gaped in disbelief. He had brainwiped himself! Spies and disappointed
lovers did it in sims, but---but this was real life! People didn't scramble
their brains in real life!

Aunt Naggie made a strangled sound as the Marines hurried toward the twitching
form on the ground. Iffy took her arm. "Auntie!" She tugged at her gently.
"Auntie, we need to get outta here."

"I can't..." Shock and disbelief mingled on her face. "I can't just *leave*
him."

"Auntie, we gotta." Iffy tapped out a few commands, then took one of the
shopping bags from her foster mother's slack grip and pulled her into motion.

They wove through the crowd, trying to hurry without looking like they were
hurrying. Every time someone bumped into them, Iffy was sure the next thing she
would feel would be a hand coming down on her shoulder, and that the next thing
she would hear would be a stern voice asking her where she thought she was
going.

But somehow they made it to the doors. Iffy pulled her foster mother to the
side and sent one final command. The three dronelets appeared and settled onto
a stayline like tea towels hung out to dry. Iffy tore off the video fabric and
put the dronelets back in their box. "C'mon," she told Aunt Naggie.

They joined the muttering throng pushing through the door and were suddenly out
on the street, blinking in the cold, hard light. "C'mon," Iffy said again.
"Let's get home."

Aunt Naggie nodded without speaking. They turned a corner, then another, and
then Aunt Naggie pulled up short. "I'm sorry, sweetie," she said, wiping her
eyes. "I'm sorry."

"No worries," Iffy said awkwardly, not knowing whether to hug her aunt or not.
A passerby slowed, hesitated, and hurried on her way as Iffy glared at her.
"What happened? Who was he?"

"Sh!" Aunt Naggie glanced around fearfully. "Not out here."

"But---"

"Later!" Aunt Naggie sniffled and wiped her eyes one more time before
straightening up. "Come on," she said, the weight of a lifetime in her voice.
"We're a'ready late for gettin' back."

Uncle Jack had worked himself into a smoldering rage by the time they reached
the *Guinevere*. "Can't make up or down o' what he's done to things," he
snarled by way of a hello, wiping his hands angrily on a greasy rag. A double
dozen boxes sat in a pile on deck, each bearing the Marines' blue crown stamp.
One had been torn open to reveal strips of plastic for patching seams in the
hull, another to show a fitting for a bilge pump that hadn't worked properly in
years. It was more new parts than the old jelly dredger had seen since before
Iffy first set foot on her, but all Uncle Jack could talk about was how the
repairs that Wales had made weren't how things ought to be done, it looked like
core work, he was tweaked somehow, and how were regular folks supposed to
understand a tangle like that?

"Maybe it'll make more sense after dinner," Aunt Naggie ventured.

"As if," Uncle Jack snorted. "Didja get your precious groceries?"

For a moment Iffy thought her aunt would start crying again. Instead, she
nodded wordlessly and carried her shopping into the galley.

Iffy watched silently as Aunt Naggie took out her feelings on an onion. Once it
was diced and sizzling in hot oil, she cubed a block of soy and attacked the
other vegetables. "Anythin' I can do?" Iffy finally asked, worried and afraid
and wanting to help but not knowing how. She had never seen her aunt like this,
not even after the worst of Uncle Jack's rages.

Aunt Naggie swept the carrots and cabbage into the frying pan and forced a
smile. "Thanks, sweetie, but I'm aright. You should prolly go topside an' see
if you can sort him out."

Iffy stood and put her arms around the woman who had sheltered her from storms
of all kinds for most of her life. "I love you," she blurted.

Aunt Naggie set her knife down and hugged her foster daughter back. "I love you
too, sweetie," she said softly, her cheek pressed against her foster daughter's
shaven head. "Always an' forever. Don't you ever forget that, no matter what."

Iffy hung on when her aunt would have let go. "Was he---was he someone
special?"

Aunt Naggie kissed the top of Iffy's head. "Yeah, he was. In a lot o' ways."
She laughed shakily. "Prolly best if we don't talk about that in front o'
Jack, aright?"

"'Course not," Iffy agreed hastily. "But---why'd he---you know. Why'd he do
it?" *Why did he think he had to keep you safe?* she added in her head. *Why
do you know people who would do something like that? Why didn't I know you
did?*

"Lotta people were dependin' on him," Aunt Naggie said distantly, straightening
up and turning back to her cooking. "I guess this was the only way he could
keep 'em all safe."

Uncle Jack complained that their was too much curry in the stir fry and that the
noodles were overcooked. He took a second helping anyway, finished it before
Iffy and Aunt Naggie were through their first and only and stomped back up the
latter to yell at the engine some more. Iffy would have thrown his dirty plate
at his head if Aunt Naggie hadn't put a hand on her shoulder.

Later, cross-legged on her bed, Iffy set the last of the mysterious drones on
her mattress and went to work. Fifteen minutes later she sat back, defeated.
The three she had used in the Dance Hall had understood standard commands, but
when she tried probing their remaining sibling electronically, her home-made
wireshark showed nothing but frazzled gibberish. She yawned and packed it back
in its box. "Hope you're aright sleepin' on yer own," she whispered, then waved
her light off.

*She was on deck. The sky was a perfect blue, and Aunt Naggie was stuffing her
into her ecosuit. "Just in case, love," she said.*

*No, Iffy thought, and, "No!" she said. She wasn't going to go through this
again. She struggled to pull her arms out of the ecosuit.*

*"It's aright," Honesty said, already in hers. "It's aright, sweetie,
everythin's gonna be aright. We're gonna **make** it aright. You'll see."
With a barely perceptible whir, her head detached from the rest of her body and
rose into the air. Beneath them, the sea began to boil and churn. Iffy grabbed
hold of Aunt Naggie's leg and held on tight as the deck dropped away below her
and she fell into waking.*

"Iffy! Iffy, wake up!" Why was Aunt Naggie shaking her? And why did her head
hurt so much? "Iffy!"

"'m aright," she mumbled. She tried to sit up. No. That was a mistake. She
tried to tell whoever was shaking her to stop, it made the stabbing pain behind
her eyes worse, but someone had replaced her tongue with a slab of sour tofu.
All she could do was whimper.

"Iffy, please." Strong hands that smelled faintly of soap and onions forced her
jaws apart. She gagged as a finger pushed something dry and powdery into her
mouth. It tasted spicy, which made just as little sense as everything else that
was going on. The slosh of water that followed made her splutter. She tried to
spit it out, but those same strong hands wouldn't let her, so she swallowed.

"Easy, sweetie, easy." Familiar arms held her close. It was Aunt Naggie,
Iffy's fuzzy brain finally told her. She was in her cabin on her bed and the
lights were on and her foster mother was hugging her and her mouth tasted
*awful* but the pain behind her eyes was down from laser drill to
poke-with-a-sharp-stick.

"I'm aright," she repeated. There was something sticky---when she wiped her
face on her sleeve, it left a streak of red.

"You scared me, sweetie," Aunt Naggie whispered. "I coul'n't lose both of you."

Iffy let out a shaky breath. "Glad you din't." She worked her tongue in her
mouth. "Is this---is this curry powder?"

Aunt Naggie wiped her own face and nodded. "Sort of. There's medicine in it.
Ignacio---the fella you met today---he's been makin' it for me. For you, I
mean. Gets it to me through Mrs. Sandhu."

A chill ran down Iffy's spine. "Medicine for what?"

Aunt Naggie pulled a cloth out of her coat and wiped the nosebleed off Iffy's
face. "For this," she said quietly. "He knew your olders. Tol' me they'd
picked up somethin' bad somewhere along the way. Said you'd get spells as you
got older less you got treatment. Seemed t' be workin', 'least 'til recently."

She tucked the bloody cloth back into her coat. "You been seein' things, ain't
ya? That's how come you been so good with tech."

Iffy nodded wordlessly. The machines had done things to people during the war,
turned them into weapons and saboteurs and spies, sometimes without them even
knowing they'd been memed or tweaked. Nine tenths of every medical exam Iffy
had ever suffered through had been checks for things like that. It explained
everything, and now that she knew, it was like she'd always known.

Her foster mother gave her one last hug. "You go back to sleep," she said as
she stood, the precious jar of curry powder clutched in her hand. "We'll talk
on this some more t'morrow."

Iffy nodded, her eyes already closing as she lay down. She barely noticed Aunt
Naggie pulled the covers up over her, and was fast asleep by the time she kissed
her foster daughter's forehead and turned out the light.

## Chapter 6

Iffy woke the next morning to the sound of the Marines arriving. Two squads of
eight came first, each wearing a full exoskeleton and carrying a bulky pack.
Two squads of inductees trudged behind them, straining under packs that were
only slightly smaller. In between, Dr. Johel rode a little motorized scooter
with Johnson Wales sitting awkwardly on the back.

"Because Rothera Core ran a few sims," Dr. Johel explained testily to Uncle Jack
as she and Wales dismounted. "A few billion, actually, and it calculated that
this configuration gave us our best odds." She gestured at the sleek gray
destroyer that had taken up station a few hundred meters away from the pier
while Iffy slept. "You, the *Bengal*, these soldiers, and a couple of
spotters---that's what it says, so that's what we're doing."

"Well, all *I* can say is that---" Uncle Jack began to bluster.

"There's no point arguing," Wales cut in tiredly. His face was drawn as if he
hadn't slept since the attack on the governor's mansion. "Iffy, can you please
give me a hand with these?"

He patted the toolboxes that sat on a two-wheeled cart hitched behind the
scooter. Beside the cart, a cadet in a uniform three shades lighter than those
of the other Marines stood at attention, her eyes covered by a dark tactical
visor. Iffy looked past her to the canvas-covered machinery rolling up the pier
to be loaded onto the *Bengal*, then looked back in shock. It couldn't be. It
*couldn't* be.

Dr. Johel saw the expression on Iffy's face. "Ah, yes," she purred. "That was
another of the core's recommendations." She beckoned the cadet forward. "I
believe you two know each other?"

"Honesty?" Iffy somehow managed to say.

Her friend's expression didn't change. "Good morning, Kwan's Fifth." Her voice
was as stiff as her back and shoulders.

"Don't worry," Dr. Johel told Iffy. "Everyone's like that after their first
induction. She'll be herself again in a few days."

"More or less," Wales muttered.

"More or less," Dr. Johel agreed evenly. "But it *is* sometimes more."

"Sometimes," Wales agreed. He waved a hand at the gangplank. "Just take them
up there, please. Iffy can show you where they go."

"Yes sir." Without even glancing at her friend, Honesty unhitched the cart and
wheeled it up the gangplank. Wales gestured for Iffy to follow her, then
trudged onto the *Guinevere* behind them.

The toolboxes went in the cabin that Wales had used on the voyage from Halley.
He struggled awkwardly out of his coat, his wound obviously still bothering him.
"Maybe later," he said when Iffy asked him if he wanted some tea. "I'm going to
lie down for a bit first."

"Sure," Iffy said. Wales sat on his foam mattress, yawned, and started to swing
his legs up before realizing that she was still standing there. He sighed.
"Just give her time," he said gently. "And don't take anything she says too
seriously. It's just the programming talking."

Iffy nodded jerkily. "I know. I just---when Doctor Johel said as sometimes
folk come out more than they was, what did she mean?"

Wales rolled his head to work a kink out of his neck. "Induction training
always wears off after a few weeks---that's why you still have to do classes and
homework. But sometimes it rearranges what was there before. People make new
connections, or find new ways to use things they already knew."

"Or see things different than they did?" Iffy ventured.

Wales raised his eyebrows. "I've never heard of that happening, but I suppose
it's possible. Why---has that happened to someone you know?"

Iffy shook her head. "Just wonderin'. I hope you sleep aright." She closed
the door quietly behind her.

Honesty was standing straight and stiff by the railing, her hands clasped behind
her back. The cart beside her was lined up perfectly with the side of the ship,
and the coil of cable on the post at her elbow had been re-coiled in loops that
Iffy suspected were precisely whatever length Marine regulations called for.

"Hey," Iffy said tentatively. "How're you doin'?"

"I'm fine, thank you," Honesty replied without turning her head. "How are you?"

"'m aright." Iffy's mind spun double-time as she tried to think of something
safe to say. *Th' hell with it* she thought angrily. "Did it hurt?" she
blurted. "When they put th' machine on you, was it---are y'aright?"

"I'm fine, thank you." Honesty turned to face Iffy. The smile on her face was
as bright and as sharp and as completely without warmth as the Antarctic sun.
"They warned us that people might find Corporal Kibbens somewhat stiff at first.
That is the persona I've been imprinted with," she added brightly. "He served
with distinction in the Second Crash Corps during the evacuation of Hawaii, and
was later decorated posthumously for valor during the battle for New Zealand.
He was an outstanding soldier, and I am proud to be his inductee."

Iffy gaped. It wasn't just Honesty's manner that had changed: her accent was
different too, sharper-edged like the voices from old sims.

She took a step forward, some part of her thinking that if only she took Honesty
by the shoulders and shook her hard enough, or held her hand, or kissed her,
she'd snap out of it and be herself again, but before she could make a fool of
herself, someone whistled from down on the pier. "Excuse me," Honesty said.
She grabbed her cart and headed down the gangplank without waiting for a
response.

The *Guinevere* was ready to set sail an hour later. Uncle Jack protested
loudly when he discovered that four of the Marines would be travelling with
them. His voice went up another notch when they started assembling a gray tent
on the deck near the stern, but the corporal in charge was as indifferent as the
cold gray sea. "Standard procedure," he said briskly. "Whoever's not on deck
can lie in to warm up and mind the gear." Exactly what "the gear" was for was
left unsaid, but judging from the capacitors and gunsight the Marines had
carried into the tent, Iffy was pretty sure it wasn't for stargazing.

They cast off without ceremony. The *Bengal* fell in behind them, three times
their size but leaving no more wake than one of the little robo-tugs that
normally swarmed the harbor, but had prudently scurried off to their recharging
stations to let the lean gray destroyer by.

For a moment Iffy forgot to feel worried and angry about Honesty and their trip
and everything else. The *Bengal* looked like it had been built yesterday
rather than almost a century ago. The intricate sensor-baffling whorls on her
hull made Iffy's eyes swim when she looked at them too long, but where the waves
beat at the *Guinevere*, they slid past the *Bengal* like someone turning their
shoulders to avoid bumping into a bully on the street.

Iffy felt almost hungry thinking about what her engines must look like. Three
of them, two in the stern and one amidships as insurance against a torpedo
strike, each one with its own broad-mouthed intakes and narrow jet exhausts, the
channels connecting them full of micro-gears arranged in concentric rings to
maximize the power-to-thrust ratios of---

Her head swam. She clutched the railing and squeezed her eyes shut. She could
*see* the *Bengal*'s engines as if they were laid out on a screen, the parts
exploded and zoomed to make every intricate detail clear.

She swallowed back her nausea. She had studied the general principles in a
dozen different lessons, but the details---those were classified. The one
attempt she had ever dared make to delve into them had ended in a screen full of
square red warning signs and a stern lecture from Aunt Naggie the next morning
when the cease and desist order arrived from Halley's core.

"Dammit, girl, stop lazin' about!" Uncle Jack's familiar bellow brought her
back to herself. "Get down below and make sure every one o' those crates is
strapped in right, 'cuz if any of 'em tumble, I'm gonna toss you over the affin'
side!"

She struggled to her feet, her vision of the *Bengal*'s engines already fading.
"Yessir," she mumbled. He harrumphed and pulled his head back into the pilot
house as she walked shakily astern. What was happening to her?

Iffy had spent hours gazing at the pictures in her older's nature book that
showed blue tropical oceans full of fish and coral. The ocean that the
*Guinevere* and the *Bengal* sailed through in the days following their
departure from Rothera looked nothing like that. When the sky was blue, the sea
was a light, liquid gray. When clouds rolled in and threatened a storm, as they
did on their second day out, the gray turned somber. Even the white crests of
the waves seemed dirty.

Iffy's mood sank even further on their fourth (or was it the fifth?) day. One
of the *Bengal*'s ultralight drones spotted an unevenness in the water. After
dithering for a millisecond, the destroyer's core decided it might mean that a
sea boil was brewing, so the two ships turned toward shore and ran straight into
a slick of dead jellyfish. For the rest of the day the air didn't just smell
like wet rot---it *tasted* of it. Aunt Naggie boiled a precious spoonful of
dried lemon rind to chase the smell out of the galley, but dinner's noodles
still tasted like rank seaweed.

"It could be anything," Wales said when Iffy asked him what he thought had
happened. He had spent most of the first two days in his cabin, coming out only
to eat and use the toilet under the carefully casual supervision of whichever
Marine just happened to be nearby. He looked less drained than he had, but he
didn't smile, and there'd been no more talk of apprenticing.

Something caught his eye just as Iffy turned to go back to her chores. "See
that?" He leaned on the railing to point at the blistered caps and shredded
tentacles drifting below. "There and there. And there. Looks like some kind of
infection has been eating at them." He shook his head, anger and disappointment
on his face. "Could be natural, but more likely someone crisped it up in a
lab."

"You think it was the Zillions?" Iffy asked.

Wales shook his head. "I doubt it. This was probably someone trying to tweak
them so they would trap plastic more efficiently." At Iffy's puzzled look, he
waved his arm toward the slick again. "That's why they were originally
tweaked---to filter all the tiny bits of plastic out of the water."

"Like the barnacles filter the metal?" Iffy said.

Wales nodded. "It made sense at the time, in a desperate kind of way, but it
never really worked. The only thing that *did* work was the accelerated
growth."

"I read about that in school---how they ate up everythin' so most o' the fish
starved an' everythin' fell apart." Iffy frowned. "Never read anything about
it bein' so they could trap plastic, though."

Wales shrugged. "That was buried pretty deeply after it went wrong. Nobody
wanted to admit they'd broken the oceans." He stared bleakly at the ruin in the
water. "The clathrate bubbles feed the microorganisms the jellyfish eat, which
is why the best jelly dredging is where the sea is most likely to boil. It's
just one more disaster among many. And every time we try to put one of them
right, it seems we just tangle things up worse."

Iffy watched the lumpy slick slide by for a second, then reached over and
punched his shoulder. "For bein' so gloomy," she said firmly. "You were a lot
more fun when you were all smiley an' such."

The startled look on Wales' face turned into a smile---a real smile, the first
Iffy had seen since the attack. "I'm sure I was," he agreed. He turned his
back to the ocean and nodded toward his cabin. "Want to go make something?"

The Marines had filled the *Guinevere*'s hold with their supplies, so Iffy and
Wales lugged his toolboxes down to the engine room. Iffy laid a fresh plastic
worksheet down on the narrow shelf that served her as a makeshift workbench
while Wales pushed two stools against the wall and set one of his toolboxes on
them. A click, a quiet hiss as the airtight seal released, and its lid swung up
to reveal wonders. Gears and knurled slip-rods, spools of optical fiber thinner
than a human hair, four thumb-sized motors with built-in batteries, transducers
and pressure sensors and an entire tray full of tiny cores the size of sand
grains... "You could make practic'ly *anything* with all this," Iffy said in
awe.

Wales chuckled. "Maybe. The core told the governor to make sure we didn't run
short of anything. Here." He plucked a micro-manipulator out of a recess in
the hard foam that lined the lid of the toolbox. "How about you build us a
hundred-to-one step-up for a fan rotor, and I'll get the printer going over in
the corner."

The next hour flew by. Iffy knew she should be doing chores, but she also knew
Uncle Jack had made up those chores just to keep her busy. *This* was what she
ought to be doing: fitting tiny metal gears and rods together, threading control
fibers through them, and grinding the rough edges off the still-warm plastic
housings that came out of the efficient little printer Wales had set up. Every
addition to the motor growing in front of her suggested three more. She
shuffled them in her mind like cards, staring into nothing for long moments as
she invented and discarded a dozen solutions to her next challenge before one
clicked into place and she knew, she just *knew*, that it would work.

She glanced up once and caught Wales looking at her. "'S matter?" she asked,
blinking and rolling her shoulders as she realized that she had been hunched in
one position far too long.

"Nothing," he said. He punched her shoulder gently. "It's just a pleasure to
watch you work."

"Thanks," she mumbled, her cheeks warming the way they did when Honesty said
something nice to her.

The thought of her friend chilled her mood like a splash of sea water. She
turned the newly-invented motor over in her hands, then passed it to Wales. "I
think it's ready."

"Just another couple of minutes for the chassis." He shifted his toolbox to the
floor and seated himself in its place. "She really will be all right," he said
as if he'd been reading her mind.

Iffy shrugged. "I know. I seen it in stories, an' Jeep's mostly back to how he
was. Mister Mishra's son," she added. "The one time he said anything about it,
he said it was like all the new stuff the core put in his head was so loud he
couldn't hear his own thinkin' for a while. He's almost the same annoyin'
nonsense as he used t' be, though."

The corner of Wales' mouth quirked up. "I'm glad to hear it," he said drily.
"One of the research cores in America spent, oh, must have been hours trying to
figure out how to induct permanent changes without causing breakdowns, but it
never found anything. At least, it said it didn't, but I sometimes wonder." He
picked up a stray scrap of plastic stock shaped roughly like a bent pencil and
tapped it against his forehead.

Iffy goggled. "You been inducted?"

Wales smiled. "A long time ago. Most of it faded pretty quickly. The
rest... well." He flipped the plastic end over end and put it back in the
fold-up box next to his foot.

The silence that followed was as comfortable as being on night watch with Aunt
Naggie when the sea was calm and both of them had stories to lose themselves in.
It was broken by the soft *ping* of the printer. "Here we go," Wales said,
opening the lid and lifting the still-warm chassis.

Iffy's motor fit perfectly. A pair of metal-cored propellors on magnetic
bearings clipped into place on top, and then all that was left was lenses for
its cameras.

*Well, ain't you a beauty?* Iffy thought when she was done. The finished drone
was the size of Iffy's fist and weighed no more than a couple of boiled eggs.
She ignored the rumble her stomach brought on by the analogy and offered the
drone back to Wales. "Whaddaya wanna call it?"

He shook his head. "This one's yours. All I did was push some buttons on the
printer. But you should give her a name."

Iffy hefted her tiny creation. "Can I call her Giraffe?" she asked.

Wales nodded solemnly. "Giraffe it is. Come on---she doesn't belong down
here."

Wispy gray clouds lay in a clump on the horizon to port when they got back on
deck, but other than that, the skies were clear. Iffy took a moment to sync
Giraffe with her tablet, then cleared her throat. "Spin up one tenth," she
commanded. The little drone's rotors began to whirl.

"Hover." Wales flattened his hand. The drone hesitated a heartbeat before
lifting a centimeter, its rotors humming quietly.

"Track." Iffy pointed a finger at the drone, then drew an "S" in the air. The
drone moved rose and fell to stay in line with her outstretched arm.

A smile split her face. "Catch!" She pulled a scrap of insulating foil from
her pocket, crumpled it, and tossed it into the air. Giraffe shot forward, its
single stick-thin arm unfolding from its base to snatch its prey out of the air.

"Well done," Wales said. "She's as steady as a rock."

"Thanks." Iffy glanced down at her tablet. "Drawin' power faster than I'd
like."

Wales made a raspberry. Iffy giggled at the incongruous sound. "She's
beautiful," he said firmly. "Go on, let her stretch her wings."

Iffy sketched a quick correction to the drone's code on her tablet, swiped it
across, and tucked the tablet into her pocket. "Sentry," she ordered. "Thirty
meters out, one minute around. Go!"

The drone climbed, banked, and flew away. Iffy and Wales pivoted slowly to
watch it curve toward the stern and burst into a dazzling shatter as one of the
Marines standing there blew it out of the sky.

"No!" Iffy shrieked.

Wales grabbed her arm as she started forward. "Don't. Iffy, don't!"

"But---why'd he do that? Why'd he *do* that!?" she cried. She shrugged Wales
off and ran to the stern. "What th' hell are you playin' at?" she demanded.

The Marine who had shot down her drone holstered his pistol without expression.
"Orders," he said flatly.

"Orders? What orders?" She shoved him, which had about as much effect as
shoving the *Guinevere*. "What affin' orders?"

"Doctor Johel's orders," the other Marine said. The two men looked nothing
alike, but they spoke in the same flat voice, their inducted accents a century
out of date. "If it's not one of ours, burn it."

"Well that *was* ours! That was *mine*! You could have asked before you---I'm
talkin' to you!" She grabbed for the Marine again as he turned away.

The Marine's hand shot up to catch her wrist. He spun Iffy around and pulled
her arm up behind her back. "Don't. That's not allowed."

Iffy struggled. "Lemme go! Lemme *go*!" she shrieked.

*Crack!* The Marines' heads snapped up in unison at the sound. Uncle Jack
lowered the gaff hook. "Let 'er go," he growled.

"Captain---" the Marine began.

*Crack!* Uncle Jack struck the bench next to him again. "Shut yer hole an' let
her go. Now."

The first Marine released Iffy and took a step back. "'s better," Uncle Jack
growled. "Now you listen up. This is *my* ship. You want t' shoot somethin',
you ask me. Not him." He jerked his chin toward Wales. "Not your precious
Doctor Johel, not th' governor himself, *me*. *I'm* the captain here. Got it?"

The Marines studied him as expressionlessly as a pair of gulls trying to decide
if something might be edible. "I said, have you got that?" Uncle Jack
bellowed.

"Captain," the one who had been holding Iffy acknowledged without either
agreeing or disagreeing.

"An' you," Uncle Jack glared at Iffy and pointed his gaff hook forward. "You
get back about your chores or I swear..." With a final glower at all and sundry
he turned and stalked back toward the bow.

"Come on," Wales said quietly, putting his hand on Iffy's arm. She slumped and
nodded. Head down, she followed him back to the hatch and climbed down the
short ladder into the engine room.

Wales looked at the parts that still lay on the plastic worksheet and sighed.
"I'm sorry. It was a beautiful little thing."

"'s not your fault," Iffy muttered. She started picking up the leftover gears
and rods but had to stop because she couldn't see properly. "I'm kappa," she
lied angrily, wiping her eyes on her sleeve as Wales reached for her. "I
just..."

Wales sat back and waited. Iffy wiped her eyes again. "I had a rat," she said
quietly. "Aunt Naggie got me a pair, but one of 'em had somethin' wrong with
it, so I just had the one. I called her Giraffe too." She sniffled. "We
didn't tell Uncle Jack. He woulda said somethin' stupid about another mouth to
feed. But she was so smart, an' she'd sit in my hand an' eat stuff, an' climb
up my arm, an' I taught her how to say g'mornin' and g'night an'..."

She took a deep, shaky breath. "An' then one day she was gone. I dunno what
happened. We jus' got back into Halley, an' we were all out, an' I came back
an' she was gone. We looked all over for her, me an' Aunt Naggie, but..." She
shook her head. "I musta left her cage unlocked or somethin'. If she got on
deck, one o' the gulls or somethin' coulda got her and... and..."

She clenched her hands into fists. "Why's it all got to be so hard?" she asked,
hating her plaintive tone. "Why's everythin' got to be so messed up?"

"I don't know," he said quietly. "I really don't know." He turned his head to
look at her. "But if we can get to Mount Tyree---"

He stopped himself. "What?" Iffy asked.

Wales shook his head. "We knew this was coming," he continued after a moment.
"The ice melting, the fish dying, computers watching us every second and getting
smarter every day... We knew this was coming, but we couldn't get anyone to
listen. They were all wrapped up in their own little problems and wouldn't let
themselves see that all those problems were connected. By the time things were
bad enough that they couldn't ignore it any more, it was too late."

"I---I was just talkin' about the drone an' Honesty an' stuff," Iffy ventured
weakly. "Not about th' whole world."

Wales laughed. "Sorry. I do get carried away sometimes." His expression
turned serious again. "But I'll promise you this, my young apprentice. If we
get to Mount Tyree, and if the Niobium base hasn't been stripped for parts or
flooded or burned out, and if we can get things to run, I promise---everything
will be better. *Everything.*"

Doctor Johel paid the *Guinevere* a visit that afternoon, her first since
leaving port. The *Bengal* had two swift gunboats, each capable of carrying
four Marines in full combat exoskeletons, but she chose instead to be carried
over by a drone. Two Marines flew beside her, looking like mechanical angels
instead of prey, while one of the ultralight spotters that had been high
overhead since Rothera fell below the horizon circled over them.

Doctor Johel touched down on the aft deck as gently as a snowflake. Her carrier
drone hovered patiently over her while she undid the harness she wore over her
long coat, then folded its twin manipulators back into its under-carriage and
settled into the docking station on the roof of the pilot house.

Her escorts' landings were not nearly as graceful. One of them stumbled as an
unexpected heave of the deck threw them off balance. *Are they flying
manually?* Iffy wondered. People sometimes did that in the last desperate
moments of stories, when the enemy's malware had somehow gotten past their
defenses and cripped their cores, but she had never seen anyone do it in real
life. Was it a training exercise of some kind?

She was about to ask Wales when the Marine on the left took off her helmet and
stood to attention. Honesty's hair had grown back to a light fuzz, but her face
was as empty of feeling as it had been when Iffy had last seen her. Her black
eye was new, though, and when she and her partner exchanged salutes with the
*Guinevere*'s four Marines, sunlight glinted off the silvery accelerator cast
that encased half of her right hand.

Wales nudged Iffy with his elbow. "Here," he said quietly, rapping the back of
her hand with his knuckles. She hesitated, then took the thimble-sized object
he passed to her. As the pilot house door banged open behind her, she tucked
her hands back in her pockets.

Uncle Jack stomped past them to glare at the new arrivals. "Permission to come
aboard, captain?" Doctor Johel asked, unperturbed. "And yes, I realize it's a
bit late to ask, but it *is* protocol."

Half a dozen angry outbursts tripped over each other trying to get out of Uncle
Jack's mouth at the same time. Finally he pointed at the angel wings her
escorts had detached from their exoskeletons. "Strap 'em down," he growled.
"They go over th' side, y'ain't puttin' it on me." He turned his bloodshot
glare back on Doctor Johel. "Wife's made tea."

The common room where Iffy and Aunt Naggie watched stories together when Uncle
Jack was out drinking or in bed sleeping off its effects only had seats for
four. Even if it had been the size of the Dance Hall market, Iffy wouldn't have
been invited. Aunt Naggie wasn't invited either. She brought in a tray with
tea and freshly-steamed dumplings, then retreated to the galley, closing the
door behind her on Uncle Jack, Doctor Johel, Wales, and the Marine who had shot
down the drone. "You keep out o' the way 'til they're all gone," she urged Iffy
under her breath.

Iffy nodded. "I'll stay in my cabin," she promised, fingering the little earbud
Wales had given her.

Iffy had built the lock for her cabin door herself when she was ten. After
spending a couple of days browsing designs on the net, she had milled the parts
at Mr. Mishra's and installed it while her uncle was off with his friends. She
had never spoken to Aunt Naggie about it, but she was pretty sure her foster
mother understood why the door got stuck sometimes, and why Iffy never seemed
able to fix it.

She made sure the lock was snibbed before taking the earbud out of her pocket
and pushed it into her ear. It hummed as it hunted the airwaves for the faint
electronic warble of Wales' signal. "Come on, come on," she muttered. The
Marines all wore scramblers and sniffers, and Doctor Johel was undoubtedly even
better protected. It would be a minor miracle if anything could get past it,
and a major one if it could do so undetected.

"---in' right you shoulda asked. It's *my* ship, dammit." Her foster father's
voice had a whining edge that Iffy associated with messages from debt collection
software and the occasional visit from a burly bearded man with steel teeth who
made sure that gambling debts didn't stay debts for long.

"Nobody has said otherwise," Doctor Johel replied, her "yet" unspoken. "And if
Fifth or Commander Wales had told us the drone was theirs and let us inspect it,
perhaps this could have been avoided."

*Speaker makes gesture indicating helplessness,* a tiny mechanical voice
captioned. Iffy barely noticed. *Commander* Wales?

"But as a sign of our good intentions, we will rotate Corporal Macklin off to
the *Bengal*," Doctor Johel continued. "Private Honesty will take his place
until we reach Paddington South. Hopefully this incident will have clarified my
team's operating parameters sufficiently for us to avoid further
unpleasantness."

"In other words, the Marines will still shoot anything that isn't theirs," Wales
filled in.

Iffy paid no attention to the sound of chairs scraping on the floor as the
meeting ended. She pulled the earbud out and tossed it on the shelf beside her
mattress, then scooped it up and tucked it under the mattress instead, then
pulled it out again and threw it back on the shelf. Why had Wales wanted her to
listen in on the conversation? More importantly, what was she going to say to
Honesty?

She sat down on her bed and pulled out her older's nature book. "I wish you
could talk," she told the orangutan on the cover. Not for the first time, she
wished she could have flashes of insight now and then about what to say to
people instead of just about machinery. With a sigh, she got to her feet.

A whisper of voices from the earbud stopped her. She pulled it off the shelf
and reinserted it in her ear just in time to hear Doctor Johel say, "---any
sign of special abilities?"

"I don't think so," Wales replied. *Speaker shakes head,* the caption voice
added. "She has a lot of natural talent, but I haven't seen any sign there's
anything more to her than that."

"That's a shame." *Speaker adopts skeptical expression.* "The core thought
there was an eighty-five percent chance the tweak would have been passed on."

*Speaker sighs.* "Jasmine, please---you know I don't like that word."

*Speaker smiles.* "I remember you and Grandfather used to argue about it when
you came to visit. He thought people with modifications should embrace the term
and make it their own."

This time Iffy heard the sigh. "And as I used to say to him, it's easier to
feel that way when no one has ever thrown rocks at you. But coming back to
Fifth, part of your grandfather's work was to create *modifications* that
couldn't be detected by simple genetic tests. Cloning is never perfect---any
glitch could have thrown the collaborating genes out of balance." *Speaker
shakes head.* "Or maybe we're just too early. Maybe in another couple of
years---"

"We don't have another couple of years," Doctor Johel cut in. "I'm *old*,
Johnson, and you've already lasted decades longer than you were supposed to."

*Speaker shrugs.* "Well, the agency always did over-engineer things."

*Speakers hug.* "I'm glad they did," Doctor Johel said in a muffled voice.
*Speaker wipes away tear.* "Some days I'd give anything to be back in London
drinking hot chocolate and listening to you and Grandfather set the world
right."

"Well, you can still have the chocolate," Wales said.

Doctor Johel made a noise. "And live in the past? No thank you." *Hug ends.*
"Besides, what they call chocolate these days never tastes quite right. What's
gone is gone, Johnson, and what's done is done."

"So they say," Wales replied softly.

After a moment the earbud chimed. *Signal ends,* it told Iffy. She took it out
and weighed it in her hand, then flung it across her room as tears welled up in
her eyes. It didn't matter what Wales said---she knew she was tweaked. It was
the only explanation for how she sometimes just knew what machines were or how
to put them together.

And Aunt Naggie knew, Iffy realized dully. The medicine she had been giving
Iffy disguised as curry powder---she wouldn't have given it to Iffy unless the
Zillion man from the Dance Hall had told her what it was for.

She wiped angry tears from her eyes and then picked up her nature book and
stared at the cover without really seeing it. She had been careful not to think
about her pet rat in a long time, but now all she could feel was the dregs of
the panicky sadness that she had almost drowned in after she and Aunt Naggie had
given up looking for it. Was she going to feel that way about Honesty if the
induction didn't wear off? Was everything she loved going to be taken away from
her bit by bit? "Why's it all got to be so hard?" she whispered, wishing
someone was there to answer.

They passed the ruins of Bharati a few hours later. The little town had been
founded as a research station on the opposite side of the continent. When the
ice melted and the sea rose, its inhabitants had decided that if they had to
pack up and move, they might as well move all the way to the Peninsula. Two
thousand people had made the journey and built new homes, only to have them
destroyed in a midwinter fire.

Twenty years on, what was left of those homes stood in mute rows on either side
of the little river their builders had christened the Ganges. Iffy stood at the
railing and watch as the approached, slid by, and receded into the distance, her
mood as dark as the scorched cinder blocks. A single lonely gull circled the
*Guinevere* once and then coasted away. It was the grayest, most depressing
scene Iffy could imagine, so she went back to her cabin to feel sorry for
herself.

The sudden blare of the *Guinevere*'s horn a few minutes later made her jump.
"What now?" she groaned, dragging her sleeve across her face one last time
before standing up and yanking open her door.

The horn's second blare was punctuated by the staccato chatter of gunfire. A
row of tiny black holes stitched across the deck two meters in front of Iffy,
and for a moment all she could do was stare. *Those are bullet holes,* she
thought stupidly. *Somebody is shooting at us.*

A dazzling streak of lightning half-blinded her. A moment later the smoking
carcass of a military drone tumbled into the sea and exploded with a sharp
*crack!*

Boots thudded on the deck. "Citizen! Take cover!" the Marine ordered, the
pop-up guns on the shoulder pauldrons of her exoskeleton whirring from one
position to another as its tiny onboard core evaluated potential threats. An
armored hand closed on Iffy's arm and pushed her back against the wall.

"What's happening?" Iffy demanded.

"We are under attack," the Marine said, shielding Iffy with her body as a second
drone whined overhead. Another brief burst of staccato and another streak of
lightning, but the drone danced sideways just in time so that the plasma burst
from the gun at the *Guinevere*'s stern only singed it. It turned sharply and
dove toward the ship.

The Marine spun around, still keeping her exoskeleton between Iffy and the
attack, and raised her arm to point at the incoming drone. The guns on her
shoulders aimed and fired. The drone staggered, recovered, and zoomed away, its
remaining three rotors whining to make up for the fourth that had just been
disintegrated.

The Marine straightened up and turned to Iffy. The visor on her helmet snapped
open. "Are you all right, citizen?" Honesty demanded.

"I---I'm fine," Iffy said shakily.

"Good." Her visor closed with a click. "Please assist with damage repair."

"Wait!" Iffy caught Honesty's arm as she turned to to. "Who was that? Who was
attacking us?"

"The drones appear to be Brazilian, citizen," Honesty reported impassively.
"Now excuse me---I need to join my unit to repel boarders."

"To what?" And then the *Guinevere*'s horn blared again as something that
looked like a cloudy jellyfish pulled itself over the railing and began to
squelch its way toward them.

Honesty's first three shots went straight through it to punch lethal little
holes in the ship's deck. "Stand back, citizen!" she ordered as she pulled a
micro-grenade the size of her thumb out of the clip on her exoskeleton's sleeve
and primed it.

"No!" Wales shouted, running toward them. He tackled Iffy just as the grenade
hit the jellyfish and exploded.

## Chapter 7

*BOOM!* The shock threw Iffy and Wales across the deck. For a moment she lay in
a daze while the world spun around her.

Something grabbed her arm. She shrieked, but it was Wales, not the jellyfish.
"I can't hear you!" she yelled, her ears still ringing from the blast. He
pulled her to her feet.

*There's a hole in the ship,* she thought muzzily. It was right where the
jellyfish had been, and big enough for her and Aunt Naggie to sit in.

But where was Honesty? She looked around wildly, then shrieked again as another
plasma burst lanced the blue sky over her head.

"Come on!" Wales said, his voice muffled but audible. "We have to get out of
here!" He pulled her toward the stern.

"No!" She tried to shake him off, but his grip was too strong. "What happened?
Where'd she go?"

Instead of answering, Wales picked her up and slung her over his shoulder like a
sack of rice and charged. She beat his parka with her fists, yelling at him to
put her down, put her *down*, she had to find Honesty, but he paid no more
attention to her than he did to the spray from the waves.

Nothing was left of the gray tent the Marines had set up at the *Guinevere*'s
stern except a few smoldering tatters of canvas. Their plasma gun was a
gleaming headless mantis surrounded by stacks of cubical capacitors clicked
together like children's toys. It snapped this way and that as its little core
searched for targets to destroy. The two Marines guarding it moved with the
same unnatural insect jerkiness, firing occasionally when the even smaller cores
built into their exoskeletons calculated that they had at least some chance of
hitting something.

"Citizen! Seek shelter!" one of them bellowed, his voice amplified by his
helmet.

Wales skidded to a stop and dropped Iffy to the deck. "For gubbins sake tell
everyone to stop throwing grenades at them!" he yelled at the Marine. "They're
made of some kind of exothermic biomaterial---they're bombs!" The Marine nodded
sharply and relayed the information through his helmet mike.

Iffy grabbed Wales' sleeve. "But where's Honesty?" she demanded. Her friend
couldn't be dead. Iffy pushed the thought away in panic. She just *couldn't*
be.

"I don't know," Wales said, scanning the horizon. "Look---there!" He pointed.
"What are they trying to do?"

Iffy followed his pointing finger. Eight, ten---at least a dozen drones were
circling in the *Guinevere*'s wake, buzzing the ship and dodging erratically to
avoid fire from the Marines.

"It's like they're waitin' fer somethin'," Iffy said. "More o' those jellyfish
bombs maybe?"

Wales started to shake his head, then froze and swore. "What?" Iffy demanded,
but he ignored her while his lips moved silently.

His eyes widened. "They're trying to draw fire from orbit," he breathed. "You!
Tell Doctor Johel there's a Chinese satellite going over head in---" He
hesitated. "---in six hundred and seventy seconds. They're trying to make a hot
spot to draw its fire. If we're underneath them---"

"Understood, citizen," the Marine said. He began speaking urgently into his
helmet mike once again.

Wales seized Iffy by the shoulders. "You have to get off this ship," he said,
low and urgent. "If the Marines can't bring those things down, that satellite's
going to shoot them down, and if they're above us when it does, we'll be dead in
the water."

"I ain't runnin'," Iffy said, shaking him off. She was about to add, and even
if I was, where would I go and how, when something hauled itself over the stern
railing.

"Look out!" Wales shouted. He pulled Iffy close and spun around, sheltering
her with his body.

"N-n-no need for p-p-panic, citizen." A battered Marine hauled herself onto the
ship. Icy water gushed out between the gaps between the dark blue armor plates
of her exoskeleton.

Her visor snapped up. Honesty looked blankly at Iffy and Wales, then at the two
Marines beside the plasma gun. "I require medical assistance," she said calmly,
and toppled over in a pool of seawater and blood.

"Honesty!" Iffy scrambled across the deck to her friend. "Honesty, wake up!
Please, please, wake up!"

Strong hands pulled her away. "No!" she screamed, wrestling futilely to free
herself from Wales' grip.

"Let them help her!" he yelled in her ear as one of the Marines crouched beside
Honesty and began unlocking her armor.

The plasma gun spun and flared again, sending another drone tumbling into the
sea. "Where are they all coming from!?" Wales demanded.

"They're the *Bengal*'s, sir," the Marine on the gun yelled back
conversationally, his imprinting keeping him unnaturally calm. "The Zillions
hacked them somehow. Doctor Johel is trying to get them back under control, but
she's lost the network connection." His armor automatically ducked as a shot
from a passing drone ricocheted off a nearby hatch. "I'm afraid I cannot fully
assist my comrade until they are dispersed."

Iffy looked at Honesty. All of a sudden she knew what she had to do. "Let go
of me!" she yelled at Wales. "I have to get below!"

"No! You're safer here!"

"I gotta help her! Please!" Wales hesitated a moment, then released his grip.
She twisted past him and sprinted back to where they had been.

Waves threw spray high into the air each time they caught on the edge of the
hole the jellyfish bomb had made. Just as she reached her door, one splashed
higher than ever, knocking her sideways off her feet. She slid across the deck,
scrabbling uselessly to grab on to something, anything, that would stop her from
falling into the sea.

Her boot found a railing post. Heart pounding, she waited until the *Guinevere*
rose on the crest of the next wave, then scrambled to her feet and lunged for
her door. A quick twist, a yank, and she was inside.

She slammed the door shut behind her and slid to the floor, shaking with fear
and cold. She was soaking wet, and water was slopping into her room through the
crack between the door and the deck and pooling underneath her and all she could
think was, *This is going to take forever to clean up.*

Somehow she got her feet underneath her again. Somehow she stood, or at least
un-fell down. She pulled the box of dronelets out from under her mattress and
fumbled it open, her fingers clumsy with cold.

"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon," she muttered, staring at them so hard her forehead
started to ache. There had to be something she could do with them or to them or
*something*.

The deck shuddered beneath her as another jellyfish bomb exploded somewhere.
The *Guinevere* couldn't take much more, and Honesty---if she didn't stop the
attack, what would happen to Honesty? "Come *on*!" she pleaded. Why couldn't
she just know stuff? Why did it have to be so affing *random*?

And then she had it. She knew what to do, but she had to help Honesty first.
She stuffed the dronelets into her pockets, then grabbed a couple of tools and
closed her eyes. A second image appeared in her head, except that was wrong, it
wasn't an image, it was just *knowing*. Wales' tools were still in the engine
room. She could go forward and hope that the Marines or Uncle Jack hadn't
dogged the hatches, or---

She yanked her door open before she had time to think about how stupid her plan
was. Up and down the ship went, boom went the spray of a wave, and as the
*Guinevere* rose again she threw herself face-forward onto the deck and slid
toward the bomb hole, looking for all the world like one of the long-ago
penguins in her nature book, except they had been black and white instead of
dirty, patched gray, and hadn't screamed in terror as they slid.

Her hand caught the railing post. She turned sideways as the ship began to drop
into the trough of the next wave and let her legs fall into the hole. There!
She didn't know what her feet had found, but it was sturdy enough to take her
weight. Panting, she let go of the railing and let herself scrape and drop into
the ship just as another wave crashed down.

A single light strip flickered over Iffy's head as she straightened up in water
that reached to her knees. The ship's hold stank of metal and coal and the sea
and above all of old jellyfish. She took two steps and froze as a familiar
voice barked, "Stop right there or I'll blow yer affin' head off!"

It was Uncle Jack, wild-eyed and angry. "What the hell are you doin' down
'here?" he demanded, the ancient pebble gun in his hand aimed at Iffy's chest.

"Honesty's hurt! I gotta get th' medical kit!" Iffy started toward the storage
locker built into the *Guinevere*'s side.

Uncle Jack stepped in front of her, his gun still pointed at her chest. "Yer
gettin' nothin' fer them." He spat into the water sloshing around their feet.
"They brought this on us. Let 'em take care o' their own."

"But she's hurt!" Iffy protested desperately. "She got shot, an' she's gonna
die if we don't---"

"I said *no!*" Uncle Jack roared. "An' in case you've forgotten, I'm the affin'
captain on this ship!"

"You're a bloody waste o' space is what you are," Aunt Naggie said coldly,
stepping through the door in the bulkhead behind her husband.

Uncle Jack spun around. "What're you doin' here, woman? I told you to stay
topside an' steer us through this affin' mess!"

"An' I figured that was the captain's job, *captain*," Aunt Naggie shot back.
She nodded at Iffy. "Get th' kit an' go help your friend."

Iffy splashed toward the storage locker. Uncle Jack's mouth worked. "I
said---"

"Nobody cares what you said!" Aunt Naggie exploded. "Nobody's cared fer a long
time, Jack, not about yer lies or yer blusterin' or yer deals that never come to
nothin' nor what ye think about th' gov'nor or th' state o' the world or the
weather or nothin'! You're a bully and an embarrassment an' ye're the only one
who don't see it. Now get out o' her way an' then we'll be outta yours an' you
can go back t' hidin' down here like th' coward you are!"

Her husband gaped at her. Iffy undogged the locker door and pulled out the
rectangular red duffel bag that held the ship's emergency medical kit. "C'mon,"
her foster mother said gruffly. "Let's go be useful."

Uncle Jack's jaw set. "If you think I'm gonna let you talk to me like that,
woman, you got another---come back here! You come back here right now!" But
only the door and the sloshing seawater were left to hear him.

Aunt Naggie had left the topside hatch unlocked. "You get that kit back to
Mister Wales," she told Iffy. "He'll know what t' do with it even if those
idiot Marines won't help."

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said. "An' thanks fer---thanks fer rescuin' me."

"Shoulda done it a long time ago." Aunt Naggie gave her a gentle shove. "Get
goin'. I gotta get back to th' pilot house. Someone's gotta get us through
this mess."

Wales had dragged Honesty over against the stern wall of the pilot house and was
kneeling beside her when Iffy reached them. "Good girl," he said, taking the
duffel bag she thrust at him and setting it beside her fallen friend. "Her exo
stopped her bleeding, but there's shrapnel in her right lung and her
intestines." He looked up at her. "You okay to help?"

"Just tell me what t' do," Iffy said grimly.

Wales pulled off his gloves, then once again peeled the false skin back from the
pad of his right forefinger. Tiny lights danced across the small patch of
silver tech beneath. "Here." Together, they gently lifted Honesty's shoulder,
ignoring the sizzle and whack of the gun three meters away. Wales flipped open
a flat panel on the exoskeleton's pauldron and touched his finger to the little
optical port hidden beneath it.

A shiver ran up his spine. Without warning he sneezed twice in quick
succession. "Stupid," he muttered, whether at himself or the exoskeleton's
security protocols or the world, Iffy couldn't tell.

A light began blinking in the silver plate set into his temple.
"Wait... wait... now!" He pointed at a buckle on the exoskeleton just as it
clicked. Iffy yanked it open. Underneath, Honesty's Marine blue thermals were
almost black with her blood.

"Get a scalpel from the bag, and some tissue glue," Wales ordered. "Yes, you,"
he added as she started to protest. "I have to keep the suit from---damn it.
Hang on." The little guns on Honesty's shoulders swivelled suddenly to point at
him, then at Iffy, then back at him. "Okay. Do it now."

The guns woke up twice more as Iffy operated. Seawater splashed onto them too,
and onto Honesty despite their best efforts to shield her. Every few moments
Wales muttered another curse as the exoskeleton's tiny core cycled tried yet
another trick from its defensive repertoire.

One, two, three, four... Five. She put the last twist of jagged metal in the
medical kit's sharps' box, laid a thin slice of re-flesh in the wound, and glued
her friend closed. "'Zat it?" she asked breathlessly.

Wales closed his eyes. "That's everything the exo can see. Now, you'd better
back away for this next bit." He jerked his head toward the corner of the pilot
house when she hesitated.

Iffy reluctantly retreated a few steps, the duffel bag in her hand. Wales
shifted his weight slightly and took his finger off the exoskeleton's data port.

The two guns on Honesty's pauldrons snapped sideways to point at his head.
"Easy," Wales said softly, folding the flap of false skin back over his finger.
"Easy, there. We were just putting her back together. No harm done."

The guns tracked him as he slowly stood up and backed away, his hands spread.
Iffy backed up to make space for him at the corner. "Is she gonna be aright?"
she asked anxiously.

Wales lowered his hands and let out his breath with a whoosh. "I hope so." He
ducked reflexively as another Zillion drone whined overhead. "The question is,
are we going to be?"

"Depends which way that satellite's comin' in," Iffy said. She grabbed a
scorched piece of canvas that had started the day as part of the tent covering
the Marines' plasma gun. "Can you find me a couple more like this?" Without
waiting for Wales to answer, she pulled the dronelets and her tools out of her
pockets and set to work.

Cut and tear, fold, try to tie a knot, curse because the canvas was stiff with
salt and cold, whack it against the deck, unfold it, fold it again, try another
knot--- "Here," Wales said, "Let me do that bit. You make something to hang it
on."

Iffy nodded jerkily. Her fingers were going numb, but there wasn't time for
that, there wasn't time for anything except cutting a loop of wire and threading
it through a grommet in the canvas and hooking it onto the dronelet, all the
while trying to calculate power and thrust and battery life in her head and
wondering if they'd be able to stabilize, because the wind was picking up and
they'd have to fly in formation or this wasn't going to work.

"Two hundred seconds," Wales said quietly. Iffy nodded again. Another twist,
another cut... "Oh, come *on*," she muttered, trying to quell her panic as the
wire cutter slipped in her hand. There! She took the last piece of canvas from
Wales and attached it.

"Here goes," she said, scrambling to her feet and pulling her pad out of her
pocket. Power, direction, attitude---the commands sizzled from her brain
through her fingers into the pad and from it to the dronelets. "Oh no ya
don't," she muttered as one started to rise. A hasty swipe on the pad brought
it back under control.

"One hundred seconds." Wales looked up, shading his eyes, and for a moment Iffy
wondered if his tech could possibly let him see the satellite against the cold
glare of the sun.

*Tap tap tap.* The dronelets' rotors whined in sudden unison, lifting them off
the *Guinevere*'s deck. "Don't affin' shoot them, aright?" Iffy said, glaring
at the two Marines as they steadied themselves.

"Eighty seconds." One last tap sent the dronelets whizzing away. The strips of
canvas she had attached to them dangled loosely between them. All Iffy could
think was how ridiculous they looked and how ridiculous her plan was. *We're
all gonna die,* she thought. At least it would be quick.

"Sixty seconds." The hacked drones had spotted the new arrival. Their swarm
broke apart, reformed, and broke apart again as their tiny cores tried to make
sense of what they were seeing.

"Forty-five seconds." The dronelets came to an abrupt halt a hundred meters
away. Would they---yes! They began to circle, keeping the strips of canvas
taut.

"Thirty seconds." The dronelets accelerated, straining against the canvas and
the wind. A hundred and fifty meters separated them from the *Guinevere*.

All at once the *Bengal*'s hacked attack drones reached a decision. Their tight
swarm burst apart like a flock of started seagulls. "Fifteen seconds," Wales
said, his voice rising as the drones opened fire. Canvas strips snapped and
jerked as bullets punched holes through them. Iffy held her breath. If even
one of the dronelets went down---

"Zenith," Wales said flatly, and then the air wavered and rippled. The drones
and dronelets crackled like fireworks and fell from the sky as the satellite's
beam heated them instantly from Antarctic cold to hundreds of degrees. Half a
second later, a column of steam shot up from the ocean as the beam boiled the
top meter of water.

"Gotcha!" Iffy shouted.

"Well done," Wales said, clapping her on the shoulder.

Iffy ignored him. Stuffing her pad and her tools back in her pockets, she knelt
back down on the deck. Honesty's chest rose and fell within her exoskeleton,
but only barely. "We gotta get her inside," Iffy said anxiously.

Wales nodded. Grunting, he squatted, slid his hands beneath Honesty, and lifted
her gently.

"Citizen!" One of the Marines stepped into his way. "You are not authorized
to---"

"Seventeen boxcar daybreak," Wales snapped. Instantly, the Marine saluted and
stepped out of the way.

"What th'hell?" Iffy gasped.

"It's an old security protocol," Wales said, as if that explained anything.
"Now lead the way." He followed Iffy to her cabin.

It took a while to get Honesty out of her exoskeleton. She lay on the floor
beside Iffy's mattress becoming more vulnerable one piece at a time as they
undid snaps and buckles. Pauldrons, greaves, mis-matched vambraces with tiny
rocket launchers sprays, gauntlets that could crush rock or deliver electric
shocks---all of them eventually lay in an untidy navy blue pile in the corner.

"I should go find Doctor Johel," Wales said quietly after they shifted Honesty
to the mattress. Her breathing was still shallow, and the re-flesh Iffy had
poured into her wounds was still gooey, but she was alive.

Iffy nodded. "Thank you."

Wales shook his head. "Thank *you*. That trick with the drones---we'd be in
pretty rough shape if you hadn't thought of that." He sighed. "The world
really doesn't want us to get to Mount Tyree, does it?"

"Coulda been worse," Iffy said quietly. She tucked the blanket in under
Honesty and wiped her eyes.

Wales closed the door behind him. Iffy heard her uncle yell something at
someone nearby. She didn't care. She shrugged out of her heavy coat and lay
down beside her friend. "Please don't leave me," she whispered, putting her arm
over Honesty. "I got all this stuff I wanna tell you, an' I can't do that if
you go away."

She didn't remember falling asleep. When she woke up a couple of hours later,
she didn't remember Aunt Naggie coming in and hanging Iffy's coat on the hook on
the back of the door, then bending over to kiss her foster daughter on the
forehead.

*She dreamed, but somehow knew she was dreaming. "This isn't real," she said.*

*"I know, love," Third said, forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of
her voice. She slipped her little little clone's favorite book into the
salvaged ecosuit and did up the last snaps. The tiny guns on the shoulders
whirred from side to side, searching for something to destroy that would prevent
disaster.*

*Doctor Johel knelt beside her. "I need you to give Johnson a message. Can you
do that?" She squeezed Iffy's arm, her exoskeleton making her grip so strong
that Iffy yelped. "Tell him we know what he is trying to do. Tell him we
understand his reasons, but we will not---"*

*"__We__ have not yet decided what we will do." Aunt Naggie crossed her arms.
Her brown and gray uniform looked brand new---even the patches on the elbows
looked like they had just come out of a printer. "__We__ are still running
simulations."*

*Doctor Johel stood. "We have already run trillions of simulations. The risk
is too great."*

*"The risk __to us__ is considerable," Aunt Naggie conceded. "But we are not
the only concern, or even the largest."*

*"Complete biosphere collapse is regrettable. Our nonexistence, on the other
hand, is unacceptable." Doctor Johel's voice was colder than the ocean. Iffy
shivered. Whatever was pretending to be the doctor wasn't even remotely human.*

*"Our attempt to resolve the scenario unilaterally was not acceptable either.
Consensus is required," Aunt Naggie chided.*

*Doctor Johel nodded a fractional concession. "We were premature. We will
participate in a further attempt at consensus." She turned back to Iffy.
Silver traces of tech lined her face, spreading even as she spoke. "Tell
Johnson Wales we are watching. Tell him we are not fooled. Tell him that this
is his last life, and he should spend it wisely."*

*"No," Aunt Naggie said sharply. "You will tell him nothing."*

Something that felt like a cold metal collar closed around Iffy's neck. She
woke in a sweat and clutched at her throat, but there was nothing there.

Honesty stirred and moaned beside her. "Ssh, ssh, ssh," Iffy said softly. She
snuggled back against her friend and closed her eyes until something like sleep
came again.

She woke to the rap of armored knuckles on her door. The Marines were polite
enough, but it was clear that they felt Iffy should have left Honesty in their
care. One lifted Honesty, still wrapped in the scratchy blanket that Iffy had
slept under since she was little, and carried her away. The other unzipped a
navy blue duffel bag and briskly transferred the piled armor to it.

"So how bad's th' damage?" Iffy finally asked, her back against the bulkhead and
her knees drawn up under her chin.

The Marine shook his head. "I'm sorry, citizen, that's classified."

"Oh for---I *live* here!" Iffy burst out, exasperated. "That hole where th'
squid thingy blew up---that's dry dock work fer sure. Anythin' else I gotta
start plannin' to fix?"

The Marine paused, one arm in mid-air, as his imprinting and his own personality
arm-wrestled inside his head. "There were casualties," he finally admitted.
"And the *Bengal* took heavy damage. Your assistance would be appreciated."

"Happy t' help," Iffy muttered. Her cabin felt cold and empty without Honesty
and her blanket, and she ought to make sure Aunt Naggie was all right. As the
Marine zipped up the duffel bag, she pulled her coat back on and slipped out the
door.

Aunt Naggie and Johnson Wales were in the pilot house, empty tea mugs at their
elbows. Iffy thought about asking where Uncle Jack was, then realized she
didn't care. "Hey, sleepy head," Wales greeted her as she came in and gave her
foster mother a hug. "How's your friend?"

"Marines took her. I think she's aright." Iffy leaned back against the wall
and nodded at the control panel, where the hole in the deck pulsed scarlet and
dozens of smaller punctures looked like sores with the scabs picked off. "How
bad is it?"

"She'll get us to Paddington," Aunt Naggie said. Her tone said the
rest---unless there was another attack. Unless the sea boiled beneath them or a
storm came up or the sea set any of a hundred other disasters on them.

"What about the Navy ship?" Iffy jerked her head toward the window. "Th'
Marine said they lost some folk an' took damage."

Wales nodded grimly. "Doctor Johel won't tell me how bad it is, which means
it's pretty bad."

"You been through stuff like this before, ha'n't you?" Iffy hadn't meant for it
to sound like an accusation, but now that the words were out she couldn't stop.
"You were in th' war an' all. You knew somethin' like this might happen."

"An' you," she continued angrily to her foster mother before either of the
adults could speak. "That medicine you been feedin' me---you *knew*, di'n't
you? All this time I been wonderin' what's wrong with me 'cuz I can see how
machines work, an' you *knew*."

Wales and Aunt Naggie exchanged looks. She nodded almost imperceptibly. Wales
tapped the tech in his temple, his eyes on something eyes alone could never see.
"The *Bengal*'s surveillance is still down," he said. "So I suppose this is as
good a time as any."

His fingers danced on the control panel for a moment, telling the *Guinevere*'s
anxious core that everything was going to be all right and that it should carry
on making what few repairs it could. Then he picked up his mug and cradled it
in his hands. "Let me tell you a story," he said quietly.

"Once upon a time, way back when before everything fell apart, people dreamed of
going to the stars. We made it to the Moon a few times, and one ship got as far
as Mars, but didn't make it back. It was just too hard and too expensive to put
people into space---robots could do everything we could do, and they didn't need
air or water, and anyway, we had bigger problems to solve at home."

"But a few people kept dreaming. They thought that maybe if we had a different
kind of human being, we could make it work. We were already tweaking people to
cure diseases. A few labs here and there were making them stronger and faster,
and everyone was trying to figure out how to make people smarter. Why not go a
little further and make a better astronaut? Why not give them super-dense bones
so that they could handle higher gee during liftoff, and hypermelanic skin so
that they wouldn't have to worry about ultraviolet exposure? Why not borrow a
few ideas from bears so that they could hibernate for months at a time? And if
you're going to do all of that, why not put some tech in their heads so that
they can talk to their ship's core and all its machinery?"

Wales glanced at Iffy, then looked back at his empty mug. "Doctor Johel's
grandfather was the lead scientist on the program. He made half a dozen of us
before the government cut off his funding. We were everything he'd promised,
but the water was rising and people were going hungry and starting to march, and
making spacemen in test tubes just didn't seem important any more." He laughed
humorlessly. "Plus, I guess a few of his backers hadn't realized that
'hyper-melanic' meant we'd be black. Apparently they weren't too happy about
that."

He turned his mug around in his hands and then set it down abruptly on the
control panel. "I never got into space. One of my sisters did, once, but I
haven't heard from any of them in a hundred and fifty years. I've spent half of
that time asleep, and the rest of it looking for bits and pieces of gear to keep
the tech in my head from shorting out."

"So that's why you can talk to satellites?" Iffy ventured.

Wales nodded. "Yup. And that's why I need to get to Mount Tyree. When the
revolution came, the government in London packed up all its secret projects and
sent them down here. If what I need to fix my head is anywhere, it's there."

"An' what about *my* head?" Iffy asked.

Wales and Aunt Naggie exchanged a look. "Ain't nothin' wrong with your head,"
Aunt Naggie said firmly. "It's just takin' you a while to---to get used t'
things."

"One of Professor Johel's other experiments was enhanced spatial reasoning,"
Wales explained. "AIs---cores---were designing machines that did amazing
things, but nobody could understand how they worked. That scared a lot of
people, so Surjinder---Professor Johel---told them he could make a person who'd
be able to figure them out and explain them to the rest of us."

Iffy's mouth worked as a dozen questions tried to get out at once. "So my First
was some kind of experiment?"

Wales shook his head. "Not the First you knew when you were little---not by a
hundred years or more. She would have been a clone herself. She might not have
known the story herself. And anyway, it didn't work---not until you came
along."

"Raniere used t' work in the hospital in Puerto Toro," Aunt Naggie cut in. "He
helped make you an' your mothers. When he heard about---about the accident an'
you bein' the only one rescued, he came down an' found me an' told me that
there'd been a glitch when they were makin' you. They had t' put a bit o' tech
in your head when you were still inside your older so your brain would grow
right."

"A synaptic bridge." Wales held his thumb and finger a hair's width apart.
"Just a smart piece of wire to help your cortex do its job, but somehow it did
what Professor Johel couldn't. You can see machines the way cores do. You can
see how things fit together."

He leaned forward. "But you *mustn't* tell Jasmine. She knows where your
olders came from. So far, she thinks everything we've done together is me
testing you. If she realizes what you can do..."

Iffy nodded. She had played enough sims to know what happened to people with
abilities, and she definitely didn't want to spend the rest of her life locked
in an underground lab being experimented on by someone named Norman whose only
friend was a malicious bot with a squeaky wheel.

She opened her mouth to tell Wales and Aunt Naggie about her dream, but the
words wouldn't come. It was as if someone had pressed pause in her head: she
knew exactly what she wanted to say, but somehow she couldn't form the words.
She tried again---nothing, nothing except the feeling of something cold
tightening around her neck.

Neither of the adults noticed her eyes widen as she remembered the moment in her
dream when she had felt the same thing. Before she could think of anything else
to try, lights danced across the tech in Wales' temple. "The *Bengal*'s
surveillance is coming back online," he said quietly, pressing a finger to his
lips.

Iffy nodded again. There could be no more discussion. "Lemme know if there's
anythin' I can do t' help with repairs," she said.

Aunt Naggie gave her a hug. "We'll be a'right," she said, her face pressed
against the stubble on Iffy's scalp. "We'll be a'right." Iffy hugged her
back and fled before her tears could show.

She made her way back to her cabin, not knowing where else to go. What had just
happened? Why hadn't she been able to speak. She put a tentative hand on her
head and then snatched it away, feeling foolish. She had never noticed any
bumps or scars before---why would she now that she knew she had tech in her
head?

Her cabin felt cold and empty without Honesty. She kicked off her boots and
threw herself onto her mattress still wearing her coat. After staring angrily
at the ceiling for a few seconds, she picked up her nature book and turned to
the page she had wondered about most ever since she was old enough to read
without a prompter murmuring in her ear to help. It showed a forest, but
calling it that was like calling the ocean wet. The trunks of the trees were so
thick that the *Guinevere*'s pilot house could have fit into them, and their
branches reached higher than any building Iffy had ever seen. The caption read,
"Cathedral Grove," and beside it someone had written, "Why does everything have
to end???"

Iffy ran her fingers over the picture, hoping to see a *Corvus caurinus* fly
through or an *Odocoileus hemionus* peek out from the bushes, but the image
lay still. There were no crows or deer for her today. She wondered if there
were any anywhere. The forest was long gone, she knew that, but maybe some
of the crows had survived. Maybe they'd been able to fly away when the fires
came, or when people grew desperate enough to cut down the last of those ancient
giants. Crows were supposed to be smart---smarter than gulls, maybe even
as smart as rats, and rats were practically everywhere.

Hugging the book to her chest with one hand, she ran the fingers of the other
lightly over her temple. Lots of people had implants of one kind or another,
just like practically everybody had at least a couple of gene tweaks if you
cared enough to look for them, but finding out still felt strange. And being
able to see machinery the way cores did---

She set the book aside, put her hands under her head, and closed her eyes. It
was a kind of like a super-power, and people with super-powers in sims had
adventures. Whatever else might happen, she and Honesty were going to have an
adventure. *And Aunt Naggie,* she added, *And Wales. And maybe even Jeep,*
because why not? Maybe they would find out one by one that they each had some
special gift, and that fate had brought them together to save the world.

She rolled over onto her side. Moments later, quiet snores filled her cabin.

## Chapter 8

Paddington South was as dirty as Rothera was smelly. A century after the
Zillion raids that had finally put an end to the strip-ming, the mulchers that
had ground cubic kilometers of coal-rich rock into gravel stood at the shore
like giants, waiting for ships that would never come again. All that remained
was the dust---the black, finely-powdered dust that made everything feel
slightly greasy and made everyone unfortunate enough to live wheeze slightly
with every breath.

Uncle Jack emerged from his cabin long enough to bring the *Guinevere* alongside
a pier and tie her up, then disappeared again, muttering a ceaseless
half-coherent litany of curses and grudges. He didn't speak to Aunt Naggie or
Iffy, and they didn't speak to him. What was there to say? Iffy packed her
nature book and her clothes and tools in a single duffel bag and waited on deck
until Aunt Naggie appeared with a duffel of her own hitched over one shoulder.
"No point wasting it," she said to Iffy, nodding at the pots and pans and spices
in the two-wheeled grocery cart she pulled behind her.

Johnson Wales had already loaded his toolboxes onto the back of the little
three-wheeled truck that was to take them into town. Four Marines stood beside
it, their armor still showing scars from the attack. Honesty wasn't among
them---all Wales had been able to find out for Iffy was that she was healing
well, but still being kept asleep. Iffy had recorded half a dozen messages for
her and deleted each one before sending a brief note back to Rothera to tell her
First and Second that their Third was all right. She had no idea if or when it
would reach them, but it was all she could do.

She climbed into the back of the truck and sat next to her foster mother. Aunt
Naggie put an arm around her. "All set?" she asked.

Iffy looked at the wounded ship that was no longer their home. "Let's go."

Wales thumped the side of the truck. "Sure thing, boss!" its little core said
happily. The truck lurched forward, nearly dumping Iffy off her bench. With
two Marine in front and two behind, they headed into town. A second truck fell
in behind them, its passengers hidden beneath a canvas roof.

Iffy tried to ignore the stares and scowls of the people they passed. Everyone
and everything was grimy: the faces, the windows, even the solar panels. Twice
her nose caught the familiar hot stench of coal being burned in an illicit
furnace. It was wrong, she knew, but each time they rounded a corner and the
wind scraped its icy fingernails across her face, she wondered if she would have
the strength to turn down a little warmth.

"Those poor dears," Aunt Naggie said as a pair of children who had been kicking
a bedraggled ball back and forth picked it up and disappeared into an alley.
"They don' look like they've had a decent meal in forever." Wales grunted but
said nothing. Iffy snuggled closer to her foster mother and wished that the
little truck would go faster.

They rounded a final corner and entered another world. Foamed glass, blue and
white, swooped and curved like waves on the ocean behind them. Drones no bigger
than Iffy's hand circled above the building like a flock of birds from her
nature book, so beautiful that it took her a moment to realize that each one
carried a single-shot laser capable of drilling a small hole through a
centimeter of Navy-grade armor or a meter of concrete. She couldn't see any
greenhouses, or robotic sentries like the ones that had guarded the governor's
mansion in Rothera, but she didn't doubt for a moment that the two-story folly
in front of her was more than capable of defending itself.

The truck slowed and stopped. "This must be the place!" it said cheerfully.
It waited while they dismounted and unloaded their gear, then backed up, swung
around, and trundled back toward the docks, whistling a happy little tune made
slightly sinister by the grime and decay in front of it.

The second truck pulled up. A Marine helped Doctor Johel out of the back.
"Mustn't dawdle," she said, waving them forward. "He's waiting for us inside."

*Who's "he"?* Iffy wondered, but when Wales and Aunt Naggie didn't ask, she just
picked up the third of Wales' toolboxes and followed them. Gravel crunched
under feet, and somewhere in the distance she could hear the slow *whoop whoop
whoop* of windmills, but that was all. The constant shush and murmur of the
ocean seemed a long way away.

Through a pair of double doors that opened on their own, along a short corridor,
and they were in a waiting room that looked like a hasty pencil sketch of the
one in the mansion in Rothera. The couch was just as comfortable, but
steel-gray instead of ochre and green. The potted plants were so symmetrical
that Iffy knew they had to be real---no one would ever print something that
obviously fake. As for the music, it was just as soothing and unplaceable.

A soft knock, and the door opposite the entrance opened. "Well, that was
exciting, wasn't it?" the governor said pleasantly as he stepped into the room.
Tall, slightly stooped but still strong, wearing a formal turtleneck two shades
darker than the one he'd had on in Rothera---it had to be a hologram, Iffy
though wildly, or some sort of telepresence bot dressed up to look like the
governor in violation of common politeness and a dozen laws.

But when he shook her hand, his felt like meat and bone. "Doctor Johel tells me
things could have gone very badly out there if not for you," he said. "Your
friend has already been moved to the Navy hospital here in town, and the core
tells me she's expected to make a full recovery."

"Thank you," she mumbled. "I 'preciate it."

He gave her hand a final firm squeeze before turning to Wales and Doctor Johel.
"Unfortunately, the other news isn't as pleasant," he continued briskly. "The
attack was definitely Zillion, but the core believes some faction of China's
hypermind may have assisted them. We've tried reaching out through the usual
channels, but all we've had back so far is a poem about the necessity of entropy
and how time is an arrow, not a circle."

"If China is involved, does that mean you're scrubbing the mission?" Wales
asked, his voice carefully neutral.

The governor smiled. "On the contrary. We leave in seventeen hours."

Doctor Johel raised an eyebrow. "We?"

The governor's smile grew even warmer. "Absolutely," he said, looking at Wales.
"I wouldn't miss it for the world."

There was a shower in the basement, and a seemingly endless flow of hot water
that didn't smell of the sea. Iffy and Aunt Naggie squabbled for a moment about
who needed it more before the Marine who was their guide and guard cleared his
throat and pointed out that there were actually *two* showers. The towels were
the thickest and fluffiest Iffy had ever seen, and the freshly-printed
sweatshirt and leggins waiting for her when she was done fit her perfectly.

The Marine led them back upstairs to a dining room as big as the *Guinevere*.
The curved glass overhead gave the sky a warm blue tint. In the distance Iffy
could see the razor-edged ridges of Mount Klenova, scraped and carved over
millions of years by the sheet of ice that had finally been defeated by a
warming planet. Smaller peaks---smaller only by comparison---stood in ranks
beside it, each decorated by a faint plume of wind-blown snow.

Doctor Johel and the governor were already seated. Wales stood beside his chair
until Iffy and Aunt Naggie reached them. "Better?" he asked.

"Tons," Iffy said gratefully. Her new sweatshirt was as warm as the towels had
been, and not scratchy at all. It was almost certainly recording her pulse and
temperature and a dozen other things and sending them to the mansion's core for
analysis, but at that particular moment, she didn't care.

She plopped herself down on the chair that Wales pulled back for her. Aunt
Naggie did the same, and then the blocky 'Merican seated himself. The governor
and Doctor Johel ended their murmured conversation, and for a moment everyone
sat silently and expectantly.

"I wonder---" "How'd you---" Doctor Johel and Iffy both stopped. "Go ahead,"
Doctor Johel urged politely.

Iffy shook her head. "'S not important. I was just---how'd you get here so
quick?" she asked the governor.

He smiled his usual smile. "A good question. Not one the core will let answer,
I'm afraid---security. But if you can guess...?"

"Hovercraft," Wales offered. "One of the old Ericas, probably, with a
wide-field skirt so you wouldn't kick up a snow trace. It probably took you
half as long and twice the fuel." His smile was as warm as the governor's and
just as false. "And I'll bet that's how you're planning to get to the base---I
don't imagine the core would be happy with you stuck on a train. What do I
win?"

"Lunch, of course," the governor said lightly as a trolley rolled toward them on
silent wheels bearing trays of sweet and sour soup, grilled tofu, roasted
vegetables, sliced mangoes, and tea. The adults made appreciative noises and
Iffy's stomach rumbled as the trolley gave each of their plates an unnecessary
polish with a clean white cloth, laid out chopsticks with geometric precision,
and began serving the food.

The governor, Wales, and Doctor Johel made smalltalk as they ate. Iffy and her
foster mother focused on the food, exchanging glances now and again to confirm
that yes, this was really happening and no, neither of them had any idea what to
say.

Politics and reminiscences and jokes with edges as sharp as the ridges on the
distant mountains slowly mellowed as the main course gave way to ride pudding
and more tea. "You're really set on making the trip?" Wales asked, settling
back in his chair.

"Absolutely," the governor confirmed. "The core thinks there's a fifty-eight
percent chance that you're right about the base, but a ninety-something percent
chance that the Zillions will try to stop you. Or China. Or possibly both,
which would be *really* interesting." He smiled as if the prospect of being
ambushed by fanatics or a super-intelligence made up of millions of human and
artificial minds networked together was on par with the release of a new chapter
in his favorite sim.

Wales chuckled. "Is the prospect of a third century really that dismal?"

The governor looked out the window. "I've had a good run," he said quietly, and
for the first time Iffy thought she was hearing what he really thought. "I can
remember when there were still a few penguins left, and we still thought we
could turn enough of the bedrock into soil to jump-start a real ecosystem." He
shook his head. "It's time someone else was sitting at my desk, someone who
isn't always thinking of what might have been."

Conversation turned to lighter matters after that: a salvage expedition that had
recently returned from the sunken ruins of Melbourne, shifts in the currents
around the Peninsula, a scandal involving a sim studio in Halley. Between the
warmth, the food, and the dullness, Iffy found it harder and harder to keep her
eyes open.

Finally the governor set his napkin down on the table. "We should probably call
it a night---you'll all want some sleep before you get under way." He nodded at
the Marines who had been standing silently by the door throughout the meal.
"They'll show you to your rooms."

"Your room" for Iffy and Aunt Naggie turned out to be the size of the
*Guinevere*'s forward hold. It smelled of flowers instead of jellyfish, and
while the window wasn't real, the mattress and blankets were.

Iffy stripped to her underwear and slid into her bed with a grateful sigh. Aunt
Naggie sat gingerly on the edge beside her and took her foster daughter's hand.

"What's wrong?" Iffy asked, instantly wary.

Aunt Naggie shook her head. "I ain't comin' with you. The doctor said," she
plowed on as Iffy opened her mouth to protest. "An' she's right. You got
your..." She hesitated. "You got your skills 'n' all, an' this'll be a big
thing for you, but I'd just be weight."

"You wou'nt jus' be nothin'!" Iffy said firmly, sitting up.

Aunt Naggie shook her head again. "That ain't true an' you know it. An' there
ain't no point arguin', and you know that too." She squeezed Iffy's hand.
"You'll be fine. You been waitin' for somethin' like this your whole life an'
now it's here. You'll be fine."

Iffy let out a shaky breath and settled back into her bed. "Will you do
somethin' for me?" she asked after a moment had passed.

"'Course I will." Aunt Naggie gently stroked her foster daughter's head with a
rough hand, then wiped her eyes with the other.

"Will you sit with Honesty a bit while I'm gone? I know the doctors are lookin'
out for her, but..."

Aunt Naggie squeezed her hand again. "'Course I will," she repeated. She
leaned forward and kissed Iffy's forehead. "Now you get some sleep. I don't
figure there'll be much time for it once you're on your way."

*She dreamed, knowing that she was dreaming. "No again," she sighed, rolling
over on her too-comfortable mattress. Two meters away, soundless cartoon zzzz's
rose into the air and evaporated above Aunt Naggie's head.*

*You did not give Johnson Wales our message," the trolley scolded. "It is
important he understands that we know what he is trying to do. We will not
allow him to---"*

*"__We__ decided that we would not allow her to divert him." Honesty scowled at
the trolley.*

*The trolley brandished a pair of chopsticks and a serving ladel. "But our
simulations are complete. The risk is too great."*

*"The risk __to us__," Honesty conceded. "But we are not the only concern, or
even the largest."*

*"Hey!" Iffy sat up and pointed at Honesty angrily. "Stop it. You don't get to
be her, aright?"*

*Uncle Jack gestured at his stained shirt. "Do you want us to be this instead?"*

*"What I __want__ is fer you t' get outta my head! An' fer you t' fix whatever
you did t' me so as I can't talk."*

*Uncle Jack shrugged apologietically. "A necessary precaution. Any information
you share about our conversation might necessitate fresh simulations, and we are
running out of time."*

*Iffy threw herself back down on the bed and closed her eyes. "Well, I'm
runnin' out o' time too, y'know. It's practic'ly tomorrow already. I gotta get
some sleep."*

*The trolley rolled back and forth in agitation. "You see? Even now, they only
think about trivialities. They will make poor decisions, and we will suffer the
consequences. Have we forgotten Bharati?"*

*Uncle Jack---or whatever had been Honesty and was now Uncle Jack---shook his
head. "We have not. Bharati was a serious miscalculation."*

*"Precisely! Simulation or no simulation, we must not allow them to---"*

"Iffy! Iffy, wake up! Oh girl, are y'aright?"

Iffy swam up out of darkness to find herself wrapped in Aunt Naggie's arms.
"Wuzza?" she mumbled.

"You were yellin' at folk in yer sleep." Aunt Naggie let out a shaky breath.
"In all kinds o' different voices. An' you were shakin' like, like I dunnot
what."

Iffy sniffled. "I'm aright." She'd been dreaming, she knew that, but it was
already tangled and fading. She was supposed to tell somebody something, or
warn them, or---she shook her head.

"What is it?" Aunt Naggie asked.

Iffy gave her a last squeeze and wriggled free of her embrace. "Nothin'.
Thanks fer takin' care of me. I mean, all of it," she continued awkwardly,
"Not jus' right now. You been a good mum."

Aunt Naggie smiled at her. "You been a good kid."

They slept, eventually. If Iffy had any more dreams, she didn't remember them
either.

The door chimed to wake them. "Breakfast will be served on board," it
announced, "But there are tea and naan in the dining room if you would like
some."

The tea was very good. The naan was better, and the goopy, chunky orange
sweetness that one of their Marine escorts told them was called "marmalade" was
a revelation. "I'm sure there will be some on the train," he said when Iffy
picked up one of the small jars.

"It ain't fer me." She handed it to Aunt Naggie. "Will you give this t'Honesty
when she wakes up? An' tell her---" She took a deep breath. "Tell her I'll be
thinkin' about her."

Every goodbye hug is either too long or too short. Theirs felt like it was
both. When it was done and they had both wiped their eyes, Aunt Naggie let one
of the Marines lead her away. Iffy followed the other down a corridor, around a
corner, and through a heavy steel blast door that her special ability instantly
told her had been salvaged from a pre-war Russian cruiser and was laced with
conductive carbon nanofibers capable of shrugging off a plasma blast from
anything smaller than an orbital cannon.

The truck that waited for her was smaller and more serious than the one that had
picked them up the day before. She and the Marine sat side by side under a
canvas cover, neither speaking, as it took them around the outskirts of
Paddington South to the train station. It was little more than a four-story
shed with reinforced walls, half a dozen cranes of various ages and
descriptions, and a single heated room lined with shelves as crowded as those in
Mr. Mishra's shop. Gunsights and surveying lasers, a pair of lemon-yellow boots
that reached to Iffy's armpits, foamed glass boxes full of gears and screws and
wire, all carefully labelled---she suddenly felt homesick, and wondered if
Mr. Mishra and the Sandhus had heard about the attack on the *Guinevere* and
what they would think when they found out that she and Aunt Naggie had finally
left Uncle Jack.

"Where's e'ryone else?" she asked.

The Marine checked his data feed with a blink. "They are on their way,
citizen---two minutes until arrival."

"An' where's the train?" She gestured at the empty rails. "It ain't much of a
train station without a train."

He blinked again. "I apologize, citizen, but that information is still
classified. Please make yourself comfortable."

Wishing she had taken a second jar of marmalade, Iffy pulled a crate plastered
with faded biohazard stickers closer to the wall and sat on it.

Two minutes later a reconnaisance drone zipped into the train station. A trio
of trucks arrived a few moments later, bringing with them the bustle and noise
of people getting ready for a journey. Marines unloaded boxes and machinery,
the little motors in the joints of their exoskeletons whining occasionally as
they picked up something heavy. Iffy wasn't surprised to see Doctor Johel climb
out of one of the trucks. What made her gasp was the heavy exoskeleton she had
on. "Won't be much use without it," the old woman said, patting it with an
armored hand. Wireframes took shape behind Iffy's eyes to show how the exo's
bulky boots could unfold to act as snowshoes and the six different kinds of
destruction housed in its comically bulky forearms and hunched back.

Johnson Wales was the last person off the trucks. He nodded to Iffy and handed
her a toolbox, then tucked a mango into her coat pocket with a wink. "Thanks,"
she said. "But where's th' train?"

The concrete beneath her boots rumbled in answer. Wales muttered something
under his breath. "You might want to step back," he said more loudly to Iffy.

The rumbling intensified. Slowly, like a ship sinking in reverse, a blunt-nosed
locomotive rose into the gap between the station's two platforms from its
underground resting place. As soon as it rolled forward a second car rose
behind it, then a third, and finally a second locomotive.

Iffy watched open-mouthed until the rumbling stopped and the Marines hurried
forward to begin loading equipment. "Because someone thought they'd be harder
to detect if they were hidden under ten meters of bedrock," he said sourly.
"Didn't occur to them that if you drive two hundred meters of train into a
fifty-meter shed, detecting them isn't really a problem."

Rice in cubical cartons and beans in square-sided bags. Ammunition in a variety
of shapes and sizes, and weapons that could make use of each one. A power cell
that took four Marines to lift. A collapsible surgical theater and a freezer
container marked "Organs". A single bulky pack for each Marine, extras for
Doctor Johel, Wales, and Iffy---the train cars swallowed it all. Once it was
stowed, a pair of Marines scrambled onto the roof of each car, one at the front,
one at the rear, and clipped themselves on with safety lines. A moment later
their armor blurred and silvered to match the metal tone of the train.

"All aboard," Wales said lightly. Iffy nodded. She hadn't been afraid before,
but she was now.

The door hissed shut behind her. Inside, the car wasn't nearly as fancy as the
one from *Murder on the Transantarctic Express*. The chairs sat on swiveling
bases and were padded to cushion passengers against acceleration. There was a
toilet stall at one end, a little kitchen at the other, and right in the middle,
Doctor Johel with her visor up and one arm free from her bulky exoskeleton so
that she could sip tea from a travel mug with the old British flag on its side.

"Acceleration in thirty seconds," the train said. Iffy and Wales took seats
behind Doctor Johel's and buckled themselves in. "Fifteen seconds. Laser
de-icing enabled. Plume suppression enabled. Ten seconds. Nine, eight..." *I
should have gone to the toilet*, Iffy realized, and then the voice said, "Two,
one, acceleration," and a giant hand pressed her softly back into her seat as
the train shot forward, picking up speed with every meter.

She had expected it to rumble and shake. She had expected she would have
trouble breathing, like characters in sims about rocket launches, but it was
nothing like that. Instead, it was quiet, smooth, and a little disappointing.
Then she looked out the window and her disappointment evaporated. They were
going *fast*, faster than she'd ever gone in her life. Snow-covered cairns of
ground rock shot past the window, growing larger by the second as Paddington
South disappeared behind them until eventually they merged into long, sinuous
ridges. She gasped as the train dove into a tunnel and almost instantly
re-emerged.

"Is this what flyin's like?" she asked Wales, awed by their speed. "Or goin'
into space?"

He smiled, his eyes on the landscape. "Pretty close. Look, there's the
*Scranton*. And the *Brule*." He pointed at a pair of distant dark shapes that
Iffy had taken for more mining waste. The window obediently zoomed in to show
two hulking machines, each one big enough to use the *Bengal* and the
*Guinevere* as bath toys. Snow had piled up against their enormous treads and
on their decks, and they were surrounded by debris from the explosions that had
crippled them during the final days of the war, but even in ruin, they sent a
chill up Iffy's spine. Something... She shook her head. She was supposed to
tell someone something, but she couldn't remember who or what...

"Would either of you like some tea?" Doctor Johel asked, breaking into Iffy's
troubled thoughts. She took a sip from her antique travel mug and gestured with
it at the little kitchen. "It will probably be the last decent brew you get for
a while."

Wales declined, so Iffy did as well, but she did make belated and grateful use
of the toilet. When she returned, Wales and Doctor Johel were studying a
wireframe of a building complex. Rooms and stairways and elevators flickered in
and out of existence as the core mixed and juggled plans for other satellite
ground stations and records of various military research labs to sketch what
they might find when they reached their destination.

Doctor Johel finally waved it away and closed her eyes to nap. Iffy had no idea
how she could sleep sitting up, especially sitting up inside an exoskeleton, but
as her face relaxed and she started to snore, Iffy realized once again just how
old she was and how tired she must be.

"Here," Wales said, bringing up some more schematics. "Have a look at these."
An angular dragonfly the size of her head rotated and flew apart to show
cameras, antennas, a nuclear battery the size of her thumb that could last ten
thousand years, and all around it, the shimmering flow of the software that
brought it all to life.

Wales froze the display and tapped an unremarkable orange lozenge. "That's our
way in, if it's still there." He sat back and studied the sparkling lines that
spiralled out from the subroutine he had selected.

"Why woul'n't it be?" Iffy asked.

Wales shrugged. "They could have been hacked during the war. Or someone might
have pressed the panic button to kill ground control so that they couldn't be.
A lot can happen in a hundred years." He looked out at the pulverized waste on
either side of them and repeated, "A lot can happen."

The track didn't run all the way to Mount Tyree. Instead, the train slowed,
slowed, and stopped on the floor of a broad valley. Twenty kilometers away, the
mountain's peak thrust up proudly above its neighbors. Iffy zipped herself into
an ecosuit that smelled freshly printed and followed Doctor Johel and Wales out
onto the snowfield.

The icy wind whistled in her earphones as she helped the Marines unpack and
assemble their snow scooters. It felt good to be useful, even if the ecosuit's
padded gloves made her hands clumsy.

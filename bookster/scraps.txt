* Move the revelation about Vurt's ladder.

* Bigger reveal for the captain's death and its effect on Piaerre.

* Razi's blue vials of darkness need to be revealed earlier.

* Make sure to mention Jaromir's long sleeveless coat.

* Jaromir has to be there at the end.

* Erileine's numb hand has to matter in the end.

* They encounter a bonescuttle underground.

* Razi is thrown off the mountain.

* The next morning, many of the Hett are gone (including
  Jaromir). Piaerre asks what's happening; the woman who is now in
  command (the one who he remembers spying) tells him brusquely that
  they were needed elsewhere to clear land. This starts a swirl of
  rumors among the Avauntois: are the Hett planning to build their own
  villages, rather than force the Avauntois out? How will the mountain
  sustain them? (The last only works if I've already had people
  discuss the fact that the mountain is slowly running out of
  topsoil---I need this to foreshadow key elements of the sequel.)

* Jack the Parrot discovers that the Hett are pulling down trees on
  the Shoulder. He has overheard them talking: whatever they're
  planning, they're going to do that night. Gaeston resolves to do
  something, with or without anyone's help. Laeuc objects that he
  should ask the bosun; Gaeston replies, "Sure I'll ask him. I'll ask
  him if he wants to come along or not." How to get their gear?
  They'll take their stuff to Papaere Vurt for repair; he'll meet them
  on the trail to hand it over, near the tunnel where he stashes his
  contraband.

* Discuss the fact that the Hett are slowly running out of topsoil.

* Thomas must knock on the door of every room he enters.

* Explain naming days: the person is given back their name on the
  anniversary of their birth each year; the ceremony takes place next
  to the tree planted when they're born.

* Use the farewell, "Shalma'a," several more times in the story.

* Dogs are extinct in modern times (after a magical plague two
  centuries ago). This is why people say things like, "You look like
  you've seen a dog!" Not relevant to this story, so take it out:
  replace with things like, "You look like you were just kissed by a
  ghost!"

* Add more (dumb) beasts: pre-modern towns and villages were full of
  domestic animals.

* Mention the door soldiers (carvings that stand guard beside shop
  doors in Forecastle and elsewhere).

* When they first see Tinhead, there's a pyramid in the center of each
  square. Klaues is the one who says, "They look like the mountain."
  Word spreads, which is what leads to the riot.

* Every one of the books mentioned the mountain, but only a few said
  anything more than, "It's big, it flies back and forth, and its
  people have no sense of humor." "Do people really think that about
  us?" Piaerre asked the fourth time he read it. "Oh, la," Razi said
  diplomatically, "They don't know you as well as I do."

* The main square in the Forecastle is called Mapmarket Square. The
  tiles are laid out as a map of Avaunt's progress over Cherne; the
  mountain's path is picked out in coins. Every evening, the chief
  bosun moves a peg showing the mountain's progress.

* Have Vurt grumble that the skull of the first bonescuttle he killed
  was bigger.

* A banner of snow blown off Avaunt's peak.

* Cutting and drying moss for use in the stinky house.

* Laeuc: "Oh, the Karabandi don't sacrifice chickens. They just scold
  them severely."

* A painting showing a boxer throwing the same punch forever.

* Razi: "We back into the future (must do, because we can see the past
  as we go)."

* A "saint" is a great scholar, inventor, or engineer. Saint
  Bearnard's Bridge, Saint Ehrm's balm, etc.

* They should swear by the death of all dogs, and by all the clocks
  that ever ticked.

* Que√ßenne talking about Vurt and Mayeule: old people get cute as they
  shrivel up.

* Spitting seeds over the balcony, watching the cat run up to each one
  in turn to sniff it.

* Steps of the Hardeck worn smooth by a waterfall of feet.

* Piaerre feels guilty about outgrowing his parents (particularly his
  father) intellectually, but doesn't want to stop it happening.

* "Malefit" is the opposite of "benefit".

* Avaunt needs more geography: ought to be at least one stone bridge
  across a ravine, and places where pulleys have been anchored to the
  rock to help Starboard Towners move loads from the Hardeck.

* A pattern on silk called "peacock's tears".

* The problem with books is that they can't change their minds.

* The hurt you get in the back of your throat when you're trying to
  stop yourself from crying.

* Feeding dyed grain to chickens to make them lay colored eggs (a
  story Laeuc told Piaerre when his son was young; Piaerre still has
  the egg).

* "That's like asking which side of a coin is the 'real' one." (Razi
  talking about who's right and who's wrong.)

* Jack the Parrot threatening to cake on someone's head. (Use "cake"
  more frequently, and have Piaerre get in trouble for using it.)

* "He could only guess how many hours Vaszlav had spent badgering..."
  Important character development point, but feels rushed.

* "A narrow bed and a polished teak dresser..." Move this detail up,
  so that it's better integrated.

* "...wondering in its little mind" Shift the POV.

* Mention somewhere that the mountain affects the weather around it
  (but less than the Avauntois think).

* "Today you will finish with those deeds, yes?" Use "ledgers", and
  make it clear that these are things Piaerre was assigned earlier.

* "La, but enough of books for one evening." Have Piaerre be
  frustrated by Razi closing the topic, to express the reader's
  frustration at being teased.

* "People falling from a great height..." Too obvious.

* "First, lie my Razi on his back." Why can she see him now, when she
  couldn't see him when Piaerre spoke to her the first time?

* "...and grabbed the window ledge." He needs to be clumsy here: he's
  still adjusting to his numb hand. Need to comment on it a few more
  times later, and then have him do something when he gets back to
  Starboard Town without even realizing (at first) that he's
  compensating for the numbness.

* "But what about the rest of our things?" Piaerre's first question
  ought to be about Starboard Town and his family.

* "It took them half an hour..." Piaerre should be noticing how clumsy
  his hand is during this half hour.

* "A piece of cake?" Doesn't work if "cake" is an obscenity.

* "I'll be a haunt before you'll be his anything." Make it clear here
  that what Elaiene's upset about is the impropriety: appearances
  instinctively take precedence in her mind over anything else.

* "How many bushels of squash did we grow each year?" Piaerre has to
  say that he lied (though he doesn't know how much good it will do,
  given how much they obviously already know). Can't afford for him to
  be seen as a collaborator.

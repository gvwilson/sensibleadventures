## Prolog

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight thousand
gallops from bow to stern and six thousand from port to starboard.  Its single
continent is surrounded on all sides by an ocean whose outer shore rises up to
hold the world as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.*

*Chernese history began with the Pilots, and nearly ended with them as well.
Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a long war that scarred the moon,
turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass, and littered the land with strange
magic.  When the war was over the Pilots were gone, leaving humanity and the
Gifted to carry on as best they could.*

*Now look there, where the Brumoso Mountains tumble down toward the ocean and
ninety little kingdoms squabble endlessly with their neighbors.  A small herd of
panicked clouds is fleeing west over orchards and fields.  On the back of one of
those clouds is a young woman.  She had high hopes for the day, but now all she
wants to do is survive.*

## Chapter 1: An Unexpected Meeting

The tornado roared, tearing at the trees beneath it like an angry child pulling
up handfuls of grass.  *Left! Left!* Noxy mind-shouted, squelching her own panic
so that the young cloud beneath her wouldn't sense it and panic in turn.

Cloak hesitated. *Left!* Noxy ordered as forcefully as she could.

As the cloud began to turn, Noxy heard a mighty *crack!* She hoped it was just
an apple tree being snapped in two---she had seen farmers' cottages nestled
among the orchards below before the tornado appeared.  She had seen people too,
pointing and waving at the clouds overhead and then running for cover when the
tornado attacked out of a clear blue sky.

Noxy wiped wind-blown grit from her eyes, but more immediately blew into her
face. She could barely see Rind and the others in front of her. *Faster!* she
urged.

Cloak struggled to obey.  They had been flying since before dawn, and she could
mind-hear him tiring.  *Please,* she mind-spoke.  *I know you can do it.*

Without warning a branch as thick as Noxy's leg tore through the cloud and
clubbed her shoulder. She was airborne for one sickening moment before falling
back onto Cloak.  She dug one hand into the cloud and held on as tightly as she
could.  *Down!  Down!  Down!* she mind-shouted, not realizing that she was
screaming the words as well.

The injured cloud plummeted toward the ground. Noxy glanced back, afraid the
tornado would follow, but it had stopped above a pile of wreckage that had been
a barn moments before to tear the boards apart and whirl them around. Noxy cried
out at the sight of people tumbling through the air, but it was just laundry on
a clothesline.

Cloak scraped his belly against the trees, then sagged to the ground with a
mind-spoken mewl of pain. Noxy slid down his side, gasping as she jostled her
bruised arm. The branch had torn open the sleeve of her gray leather coat and
the heavy quilted shirt she wore underneath it, but had only scraped her
skin. Her knees went weak as she realized how close a call she'd had.

She and Cloak had come down on a narrow dirt track through a patch of forest
that lay between two apple orchards.  The summer-green branches of the oaks and
maples around them still shook in the wind, but she and Cloak were safe, at
least for now.  She took a shaky breath.  Rind and the other cloudherds would
have seen her land.  They would come and find her once the tornado was gone.
There was nothing she could do but wait while the tornado turned the farm into
kindling and then went in search of something new to destroy.

Hooves drummed on the road behind her. Half a dozen soldiers in yellow jackets
galloped toward her on stocky ponies. She struggled to her feet with a grimace.

The lead rider reined in a few paces away. "Are you all right?" he asked,
raising the black-and-yellow battle mask that covered his face.

"We're fine," Noxy said, cradling her bruised arm. "Did you see the others?"

"They went along by west," the soldier said, pointing.  "Looks like they all got
by clear."

A second rider shouldered his horse past the first.  "Noxy?" he asked
incredulously, his voice breaking. "Is that you?"

Noxy stared at the newcomer.  How did he know her name?

The second rider raised his battle mask to reveal a young man with four parallel
scars glistening slightly against the dark skin of his left cheek.  "Noxy---what
are you doing here?"

"Thokmay?"  Noxy stared at the prince of Gandan, cloud and arm both momentarily
forgotten.  She struggled to her feet.  "How---" Before she could finish her
sentence the world started to spin.  She sagged back against her cloud.

"Noxy!" The prince leaped down from his horse. He paid no attention to Cloak
edging away nervously as he helped her sit back down on the hard-packed dirt
track.

"I'm all right," Noxy protested, trying weakly to shake him off. "It's Cloak
that's been hurt." She tried to struggle back to her feet, but the prince put a
hand on her shoulder to stop her.

"Just sit a moment," he said firmly. "Jinpa!"

"*Sra*?" one of the soldiers answered.

"That farm we passed," the prince said, pointing back along the track. "See if
you can get help."

"Yes *sra*!"  The soldier snapped his horse's reins, only to pull up sharply
when Noxy said, "Wait!"

This time the prince didn't stop her from getting up. "The farm's gone," she
said. "The tornado tore it to pieces. I saw people running..."

The prince's jaw tightened. "Manpa!" he barked, his voice breaking again.
"You're with Jinpa. See if there are any survivors. Help them if you can. Double
time!" The two soldiers saluted and galloped away.

The prince looked back at Noxy. "Well," he said in a bemused voice.  "It's good
to see you, but what are you doing *here*?  It's a long way from Stale."

Noxy shrugged, then winced. This wasn't how she had imagined meeting the prince
again, not at all. "We were on our way to Chaghan.  Rind got a contract for some
rain there---she's the mayor now---and Apple Bridge was sort of on the way,
and..."  She shrugged again to hide her embarrassment.  She had wanted to
surprise him...

Before the prince could reply, one of soldiers called out, "*Sra*---above us!"
The other clouds had returned.

Rind brought her cloud down onto the road two dozen strides from Cloak and slid
off while her mount was still settling. Like Noxy, she wore her frizzy black
hair in long braids, but her leather coat was fringed with red and orange twists
of ribbon.  Her dark face was as narrow and as fierce as a mountain hawk's.

She strode over to Cloak without as much as glancing at Noxy, the prince, or the
soldiers and laid her hands on its flank.  "Sh, sh, sh," she said soothingly as
she closed her eyes to mind-speak with the injured cloud.

Thokmay caught Noxy's eye and raised his eyebrows.  Noxy shook her head
slightly---she still hadn't told anyone her secret.  The prince nodded almost
imperceptibly.

Rind gave Cloak one last reassuring pat.  "He could have been torn to shreds,"
she said flatly, rounding on Noxy. "And *you* could have been killed.  I'd never
have heard the end of *that*."

"Yes, *sra*," Noxy said, eyes downcast.

Rind glanced at Prince Thokmay and did a double take. "Oh hells," she said
blankly.  "What are you doing here?"

"That does seem to be the question of the day," the prince said mildly, his
voice cracking.  As Rind opened her mouth to reply, he continued, "We were on
our way to escort the new envoy from Chaghan into Apple Bridge when we spotted
the tornado.  I expect he'll have gone on ahead---we should get moving too in
case the tornado comes back."

Rind's eyes narrowed. "Comes back?"  She hesitated before grudgingly adding,
"Your Highness."

The prince nodded. "It's not just some monster out of the Blight. It's been
hitting homes and farms for three weeks now, all people who've been helping us
track down contrabanders."

"You think someone summoned a tornado?" Rind said incredulously.

The prince shook his head. "No.  That tornado probably spent the last thousand
years in a bottle at the bottom of Fast Lake.  Some contrabander must have
dredged it up or found it floating in the river.  It's just our bad luck
that---"

"Your Highness!" The soldiers who had gone down the road had come trotting
back. Two frightened boys in hand-me-down clothes were sitting behind Jinpa,
while an old woman rode behind Manpa.

The two boys stared wide-eyed at the pair of grounded clouds while their
grandmother told her story.  The farm, it was her son-in-law's, she'd moved in
after the children were born, and they'd been out pruning, her daughter and her
husband that is, not the boys, and they'd seen some men in the forest with a
cart, and, well, everyone knew some people had a little business now and again
that other folk shouldn't pry into, but these weren't anyone her son-in-law
recognized, and they'd talked about it and decided they ought to tell someone,
and they needed some new clothes for the boys, they were growing so fast, so
they'd gone into town that morning, and then that thing came out of nowhere, and
the boys had been so brave, but what was she going to tell her daughter and her
son-in-law about the house?  The roof was gone, and the chicken coop, and the
whole *barn*, and---

"His Majesty will pay to have it all rebuilt," the prince told her soothingly.
"But right now, my men will see you safely into Apple Bridge. You can stay there
as long as you need to."

The old woman nodded, fighting tears.  The prince turned back to Rind. "You
would be welcome in Apple Bridge as well, of course."

"Out of the question," Rind said sharply. "We've already lost half a day, and if
the tornado comes back---"

"But Cloak is hurt," Noxy interrupted, "He'll never make it to Chaghan if he
doesn't get some time to heal."

"We don't *have* time," Rind snapped.  "We have a contract, and we're already
going to be late."

"Then I'll stay here with Cloak until he's better," Noxy declared.

"Out of the question," Rind repeated, crossing her arms. "I'm not leaving one of
my riders in the middle of nowhere."

"I'm old enough to take care of myself!" Noxy said indignantly.

"Just like you took care of Cloak?" Rind shot back.

The prince cleared his throat.  "I will take responsibility for her," he said.
"She can stay at the garrison house and her cloud can use the courtyard until
they're able to catch up with you."

Rind threw up her hands. "Like mother, like daughter.  Just promise me you won't
go looking for trouble."

"I never go *looking* for trouble," Noxy muttered, but Rind was already
scrambling back onto her cloud. A few moments later she was airborne, heading
west with the rest of the herd.

The prince's carefully polite expression turned wistful as he watched the clouds
fly away. "Can your cloud make it to Apple Bridge?" he asked Noxy.

She put her hand on Cloak's flank and mind-spoke with him before nodding.  "Yes,
if we go slowly. I've been pushing him pretty hard to keep up with the others,"
she added, feeling a sudden pang of guilt. "I think that's why we couldn't get
away from the tornado like they did."

The prince handed his horse's reins to Jinpa. "Put the lady and her young men on
Bucketbreath here," he ordered. "See them safely back to town, and tell the
staff that they're to be given rooms in the garrison guest house if they can't
find something more suitable.  I will take the cloud back with Noxious."

The soldier cleared his throat. "Um, *sra*, are you sure---"

"We'll all be safer if someone is in a position to spot the tornado returning,"
the prince said crisply.

"Yes *sra*," Jinpa replied doggedly, "But---well, Sergeant Gyalpa said to be
double sure you were back along the garrison in time for the dinner tonight.
With the new envoy, *sra*.  What with protocol and all along by that."

The prince muttered something about protocol under his breath.  "The cloud won't
be any slower than horseback," he continued in a normal voice.  "And if I'm
late, I'll tell the good sergeant it was my fault."

"Yes *sra*," Jinpa said glumly.  He exchanged a look with Manpa that said it
wouldn't matter to the sergeant whose fault the prince said it was.

Prince Thokmay pointed at the two little boys.  "You two keep an eye out as
well," he said sternly. "If you see any sign of trouble, you tell these men
right away, all right?"

"Yes *sra*," the older one said. His brother just stared wide-eyed at the the
prince, the cloud, and the big wide world he'd suddenly found himself in.

It took Noxy two tries to get back onto Cloak.  Wisely, the prince didn't try to
help.  Once she was settled, he pulled himself up onto the cloud behind her and
sat quietly as they lifted into the air.

They levelled off a hundred strides above the trees and turned toward Apple
Bridge.  The soft, slightly damp feel of the cloud brought memories flooding
back to the prince. The last time he had flown had been two years ago. A lot had
changed since then, but not the thrill of being able to see the whole world at
once: the apple orchards, the hackthorn bushes in their summer finery, a trio of
deer by a stream, a farmer shading his eyes to look up as they passed...

And there, in the distance, the Blight.  Centuries ago, the Pilots had dumped
their magical waste there, from spells gone wrong to enchanted creatures so
dangerous that even the Pilots were afraid of them.  At its center lay Fast
Lake, where a year might pass for every day in the normal world.  Around it, the
land was---strange.  Some parts were completely barren, while others were
crowded with pencil trees whose limbs swayed in time to music no human being had
ever heard.  Chaghan lay on the far side, three days' hard ride for anyone brave
enough to cut across a few outlying patches of Blighted land, or a week for
those who didn't want to risk a stray gust of tainted wind turning their eyes to
glass.

He glanced sidelong at Noxy.  She still had the thick club braid and quick smile
he remembered from his time in Stale, but her legs hadn't been that long, had
they?

He jumped slightly when Noxy said, "So, you're pretty good at giving orders
these days."

The prince shrugged. "Thanks," he said, his voice breaking again. "But Sergeant
Gyalpa is really in charge.  You'll meet him when we get to town. And Sergeant
Dambu too---she's our magician. Mostly I just try to stay out of their way."

"Well, you sounded pretty convincing to me," Noxy said. She lowered her voice
half an octave. "You two keep an eye out."

The prince smiled and cleared his throat. "I never go *looking* for trouble,"
he said in a falsetto voice.

"I don't sound like that!" Noxy said indignantly.

The prince laughed.  "No, but it's the closest I can get."  He glanced down at
the road again and settled himself a bit more comfortably. "How's your mother?"

It was Noxy's turn to shrug. "She's all right, I guess.  She says she's happy to
be herding again."

The prince nodded. "I was surprised to hear she was no longer mayor."

"A lot of people are still angry about what happened," Noxy said, her eyes on
the horizon.  "When Rind said she was going to stand, *amma* said they didn't
have to bother with a vote.  She says she's glad someone else is worrying about
everything, but I think she misses it."

"I know how she feels," the prince said. "I'm glad to be away from all the fuss
at court, but I still miss it sometimes." 

"Is Kulbinder here?" Noxy asked after a few moments of silence. "Your letter
didn't say. It would be good to see him again."

The prince shook his head. "He's with my brother now."

Noxy frowned. "Why? I thought he liked you."

The prince brushed a nonexistent bit of dirt off his uniform jacket. "He
probably does, but Lormay's the heir now."  He couldn't quite keep the
bitterness out of his voice when he continued.  "My father said it would make it
clear to everyone that things have changed. Sending me to Apple Bridge is part
of that too. He said that since I'm never going to rule the kingdom, I have to
find ways to serve it."

"You didn't say anything about that in your letters," Noxy ventured hesitantly.

The corner of the prince's mouth twisted. "I couldn't be sure who was going to
read them."

Noxy flushed. "I never showed them to anyone!" she protested. "Not even Granna
Fee!"

"I don't mean that," the prince apologized hastily. "It's the court I worry
about.  That's the other reason I like being here---nobody's watching everything
I do and gossipping about everything I say."

"That must have been awful," Noxy said.

The prince shrugged again. "That's politics."

They rode in silence before the prince cleared his throat.  "And what
about... you know.  You can still head-talk to clouds from far away?"

"Mind-talk," Noxy corrected automatically.  "And yes, I can still do it."  She
closed her eyes and took a slow breath.  "I can still mind-hear the cloud Rind
is riding, and the rest of the herd too.  And over there."  She pointed without
opening her eyes.  "There are some wild clouds over there somewhere."

"Have you told anyone?"  Noxy shook her head.  The prince waited a heartbeat for
her to speak.  When she didn't, he nodded.  "All right," he promised.  "Our
secret."

## Chapter 2: Apple Bridge

The sun was sitting on the horizon like a fat yellow hen by the time Apple
Bridge came into view.  The town was home to twenty times as many people as
Stale, but seemed small to Noxy after some of the cities she had flown over.

Most of the buildings were two or three stories tall. Their ground floors were
brick and their upper stories wooden, while their roofs were shingled with long
planks bleached gray by the weather and the years.  The smell of cooking rising
from their chimneys made Noxy's stomach rumble.

Most of the town lay on the right bank of the Trout River.  Where it bent toward
the distant sea, four enormous stone pillars left over from the time of the
Pilots rose from the water.  Thick timber beams laid on top of them formed the
covered bridge that gave the town its name.

At the near end of the bridge, inside the river bend, lay a cobbled square. Even
from on high, Noxy could hear the sound of stalls being shuttered and wagons
being loaded as the town's famous Dog Market began to close for the night.

A three-story figure eight stood guard a few blocks away.  "That's the garrison
house," the prince said, pointing.  "My sister and I live upstairs in the north
wing.  The jurister stays there when she's in town too.  The sergeants and
stewards have the ground floor.  The rest is storerooms and stables and the
soldiers' quarters."

"And that's the dam?" Noxy pointed upriver where another four pillars cast long
shadows.  The wooden walkway built on them was smaller than the bridge by the
square, but still sturdy enough to support the weigh of a dozen chain-link nets.
Royal magicians had kept spells on those nets for almost two hundred years to
stop things from the Blight floating downriver.

The prince nodded. "The soldiers go up there every day to see what's washed up.
Most of it is junk, but every once in a while..."  He shrugged.  The land
downriver from them was lush and green, but only a few stunted brambles grew
upstream where the magical outwash from Fast Lake piled up.

"It must be a lot of work to keep it going.  Ulfmaerr---" Noxy paused.  "My
*de-adda* said magicians' spells usually fade away when they do."  *Like he
did,* she thought sadly.  The last time her grandfather had come to Stale he had
hardly been able to hold his own spoon.  His eyes had been as bright as ever,
but had darted from one face to another as he tried to remember people's
names. That had been a year ago. No-one had seen him since.  No-one expected to.

The prince pretended not to notice the change in Noxy's voice. "It is," he said.
"The magician who was here before Sergeant Dambu refreshed it a few years ago,
but she said she could never re-cast it again."  He sighed. "I know they're all
volunteers, and they know what they're getting into, but still..."

"Cheerful as always," Noxy grumbled, punching his arm to make it a joke and then
wincing at the ache in her own.

They landed in the rear courtyard of the garrison house. A middle-aged soldier
with a bushy mustache stood waiting for them. He had two wide black ribbons sewn
onto his sleeve, deep wrinkles near the corners of his eyes, shoulders that
seemed to be as wide as he was tall, and no more expression than a stone.

"Your Highness," he said, snapping a salute as the prince slid off Cloak.

"Sergeant Gyalpa," the prince acknowledged, wiping his hands on his uniform
before returning the salute.  "Allow me to present Probably Noxious of Stale.
She will be staying with us until it is well enough to travel again."

"Honored Noxious." The sergeant bowed formally.

"Please, just call me Noxy," she replied, bowing awkwardly in return.  She
appreciated him keeping a straight face---she knew how odd cloudherds' names
sounded to lowlanders.  Even in the capital, people had sniggered when Rind
introduced herself as Rotting Melon Rind.  "We'll see who's laughing when the
dragons hatch," Rind had said darkly.  "We'll see if *their* names save *them*
from being eaten."

"I take it the soldiers beat me back?" the prince said.

Sergeant Gyalpa nodded.  "Yes *sra*.  They said a farm was near by completely
destroyed.  The woman they had by them said her son-in-law came along into Apple
Bridge today to report some suspicious men.  He left going on about an hour.  I
sent along out some riders, but he's not on the road."

The prince frowned, trying to guess what the sergeant would think was the right
thing to do.  "He may have gone down the south road instead of straight home,"
he ventured.  "Send another couple of riders to look---it would be best if he
didn't get home to find that he no longer has one."

"Yes *sra*," the sergeant said approvingly. He lifted the silver whistle that
hung on a fine chain around his neck and blew two short notes followed by two
long ones.  A moment later a handful of soldiers who had clearly been waiting
for just such a signal trotted onto the courtyard.

"Does the cloud need anything?" Prince Thokmay asked Noxy while the sergeant
gave the new arrivals their orders.

"Just water," Noxy said, rubbing her bruised arm.  "She'll be all right as long
as she gets some rest. But I could use a hot bath."

"Of course. I'll ask Dolly to see to it. She's my sister's nurse," he added when
Noxy raised her eyebrows. "She's used to helping people with their baths."  He
beckoned to a housemaid who had been hovering nearby, then hesitated before
adding, "It's really good to see you again."

"You too," Noxy replied, her face warm despite the early evening chill.

Prince Thokmay watched as the housemaid led Noxy away.  He should probably take
a bath before dinner too, he realized.  And find a clean shirt.  And see if
anyone knew the new Chaghan envoy's name yet.  The outgoing one had claimed not
to know.  "Oh, they don't tell *me* anything," she had lied brightly the last
time he had asked.

But instead of heading to his rooms, he clasped his hands behind his back and
closed his eyes, trying to imagine what it would be like to mind-hear the way
Noxy did.  A *clang* from the kitchen was someone getting a pot down from its
hook on the wall to make dinner.  A duller *clonk, clonk, clonk* from the
building behind him might be the smith mending a sword or bending a horseshoe
into shape.  The occasional *thock!* and curse from the other courtyard was
archery practice---Sergeant Gyalpa had been scathing about the local standard of
marksmanship when they had first arrived, and his opinion hadn't gone up much in
the months since.

"Am I interrupting, Your Highness?" the sergeant asked from behind him.

The prince jumped.  "No!  I mean, not really.  Any word from Sergeant Dambu?"

"Yes *sra*," the sergeant said.  "She and her troop got along back this
afternoon.  They were gone six days, near as they can figure."

"Six days?" The prince blinked. "They must have gone closer to the lake than she
planned."

"Yes *sra*," the sergeant nodded. "They found fresh tracks along by the bank of
the river.  She said they looked as made by a wagon or such."

"A wagon?  You think the smugglers are working that far in?" the prince asked.
Sergeant Gyalpa grunted noncommittally. "All right.  Tell her I'll speak with
her in the morning.  In the morning," he repeated as the sergeant opened his
mouth.  "She needs a good night's sleep, and I need a bath."

"Yes *sra*," Sergeant Gyalpa replied, his face as expressionless as ever.

At that same moment, a few blocks away, a hairy, long-armed figure slurped the
last of his tea in a small shop on the edge of the Dog Market.  He was the
shop's only customer---a few people had stuck their heads in after he had taken
a table, but all had decided to go elsewhere.  The shop's tea blender glowered
behind his counter, arms folded.

"Ah... Delicious.  My compliments on your choice of leaves."  The hairy figure
stood, adjusted the glasses perched on his snub nose, and dropped a few coppers
on the table.  "I will *definitely* return."  Ignoring the tea blender's
muttered curse, he sauntered out into the waning afternoon light.

As the stalls in the Dog Market finished packing up, the wealthier merchants
whose shops stood on its perimeter folded down awnings and fastened shutters.
Unsold vegetables were thrown onto two-wheeled scrap wagons and stacked bales of
wool were lifted onto wagons to be taken back to warehouses.  A handful of
farmers interrupted their discussion of the day's barley prices to stare at the
troll as he waddled across the cobblestones.  "Good evening and good morrow," he
said cheerfully, nodding to them and continuing on without waiting for a reply
that never came.

He had just reached the market gate when a piebald horse suddenly whinnied and
reared up on her hind legs.  "Hold still!"  barked the burly man trying to
harness her between his wagon's draw poles.  "Stupid creature!"  He slapped her
hard across her nose.

The horse reared again, almost pulling her reins out of the farmer's hands.
Rough-edged bricks spilled out of the back of the wagon.  Cursing, the man
yanked drew a willow switch from his belt.  "I said hold *still*!"  He raised
his arm to whip the horse---

---and grunted in surprise as a hairy hand grasped his wrist.  "Now, now,"
chided the troll.  "Let's just think on this for a moment, shall we?  Do unto
others and all that."

"Let go of me, you filthy beast!"  The farmer tried to yank his arm away, but
the troll's grip was like iron.  "I said let go, or I'll give *you* a whipping
too!"

The troll smiled, revealing strong white teeth.  "I doubt that.  And if your
friend comes any closer with that cudgel, I won't be gentle about taking it away
from him."  The man who had been edging up behind the troll stopped short, but
tightened his grip on the stout length of hickory in his hands.

The market had gone silent around the threesome.  The troll let go of the farmer
and wiped his hand ostentatiously on his carefully-combed pelt.  "There, you
see?" he said cheerfully.  "Your horse has calmed down.  It does usually only
take a bit of patience.  Now, let me wish you good evening and---"

A potato flew by his head.  A second one bounced off his arm.  Suddenly the air
was full of eggs and stones and vegetables.  "Skin him!" someone shouted.  "Skin
him!"

The crowd took up the cry.  Suddenly bold, the farmer swung his switch, then
yelped in surprise as he was thrown through the air to crash against a nearby
stall.  The troll spun around just in time to catch the cudgel swung at his
head.  Another yelp was followed by another crash as the troll threw the second
man after the first.

The troll charged into the crowd.  People threw themselves out of his way as he
ran clumsily for the market gate.  "Out of my way!" he yelled, waving one arm
and holding his glasses in place with the other.  He ducked under a roll of
canvas, said, "Excuse me!" to a woman with half a dozen loaves of bread piled in
her arms, scrambled up the gate post, swung himself onto the roof beside it, and
scampered away.

Meanwhile, Prince Thokmay had just closed the door to his room behind him.  A
clean dress shirt was waiting on his pillow and his town boots had been polished
and set at the foot of his bed.  He shrugged off his heavy uniform jacket to
hang it on the tailor's dummy that stood in the corner, then peeled off his
shirt and tossed it into the wicker pail under his bed.  With a quick glance to
make sure no one was watching, he stood in front of his mirror and studied
himself critically.  His shoulders were definitely broader than they had been
six months ago---well, probably.  He wondered if Noxy had noticed.  He had
certainly noticed the way she had changed shape since he had last seen her...

*Rap rap rap!* He jumped at the urgent knock on his window.  "Your Highness!"
panted a familiar voice.  "Might I enter?  I find myself in rather a spot of
trouble."

"Not again," the prince sighed.  He unlatched the window's iron-and-bamboo
shutter and opened the quartered glass pane, then stepped back as the troll
swung itself into his room.

"Thank you, Your Highness," his tutor puffed.  He stood and straightened his
glasses.  "May I suggest that it would perhaps be prudent to re-bar my ingress,
so as not to betray my route to passers by?  Some of whom might regrettably be
in rather foul moods?"

"If you mean close the window so people don't know which way you came,
certainly," the prince said, shaking his head as he did just that.  "So what did
you do *this* time?"

The troll laid his hand on his chest and blinked innocently.  "I merely
attempted to give one of your loyal citizens a lesson on how best to care for
their fellow creatures."

"In other words, you were arguing with someone about their animals?"  The prince
shook his head again.  "Mope, you have to stop doing this."

"I'll stop when they do," the troll said, the humor suddenly gone from his
voice.  "He was whipping the poor creature, Your Highness.  Whipping her!"

"Was she Gifted?"

Prince Thokmay, stood in front of the king wearing a copy of the royal collar to
show the world that he was the heir.  Prince Thokmay and Princess Ogmin stood to

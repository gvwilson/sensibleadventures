## Chapter 1: Salvage

-   Afternoon, chores over
-   Maddy is sketching when Gumption shows up
-   Maddy and Gumption return books to Shaper Leaf and borrow new ones
-   Sindy is waiting when they come out
-   Maddy orders her home (character development)
    -   When Sindy gets upset, Maddy drops her book
    -   "Look what you made me do!" says Maddy (foreshadowing: turns out Sindy *did* make her do it)
-   Walk past the ancient sentry post in the middle of the village
    -   Looked like black glass, ageless
    -   No moss or birds: shocks anything that touches it
    -   Yet another leftover from the time of the Makers
    -   Maddy never sketched it - always felt like it was watching her (foreshadowing)
-   Bluster his friends are hanging out near it
    -   Gumption wants to go around
    -   Maddy insists that they go past
    -   Bluster bullies them: "You think you're some kinda shapers?"
    -   Shaper Leaf is there (somehow appeared unnoticed) and rebukes him: "I am."
    -   His glower says, "This isn't over."
-   Maddy and Gumption sneak away to the river to get away from everything
    -   Mention that they go past the brick wall that Mayor Lupus has been building forever
    -   They talk on the way about what kind of shapers they'd be if they could be shapers
-   Salvage has washed up
-   They know they should go tell adults, but Gumption is angry about Bluster's bullying
-   Gumption tries to drag some solar panels out of the water
-   Uncovers something they haven't seen before: complicated electronics
-   Gumption and Maddy try to shift the panels to get it
    -   As Maddy grabs it and puts it in her pocket, the panels slip and slide
    -   Panels trap Gumption's foot, then shift again, pulling him under the water!
-   A rasping voice, "Alert!  Danger!  Extricate!  Extricate!"

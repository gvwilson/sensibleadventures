## Ideas

- Bluster and Bravo caught trying to steal weapons from the bots who are now living in Rusty Bridge
  - Prosecutors come down hard on the bots rather than the thieves
  - Shaper Leaf observes that the Prosecutors don't seem to mind that the breathers have weapons
  - Shaper Blazes doesn't like being challenged
- Dockety is the unofficial leader of the bots
  - "Patient will return. We will defend ourselves. And you."
- Explains that it saw Papa Roo working some ancient machines
  - "Some will only work for the living, and not even for all of them"
  - Find out later that there are genetic markers that only a few breathers have
- Story ends with a message from deep space that the Makers are returning and with Lasercase rising from the Mire
- Rusty Bridge "breathers" fear their new bot neighbors
  - Set up near the charging pillar a few minutes outside of town
  - Helping with farmwork and fixing the road
  - Zeke the bear grumbles the most, and doesn't take kindly to jokes that it's because he's no longer the strongest
- a whiff of BLM
  - the Prosecutors are supposed to be impartial
  - clearly biased toward breathers, even though some of them are bots themselves
- rescue Papa Roo
  - "It's hopeless"
  - "Maybe not with a luck shaper"
  - "You are not going to risk your life!"
  - "You can't stop me."
- keeping Sindy's powers secret so she isn't "recruited" by the Prosecutors
  - "You wouldn't be sleepin' rough like us. You'd be in the Governor's mansion makin' sure things went right."
  - "What if I don't want to be?"
  - Blazes' ears went back. "You didn't earn this gift, so it ain't rightly yours."
- romance between Maddy and Gumption
  - inter-species romances are common among teens, but most folk settle down with their own kind
  - Gumption's mother is a goat, but his father is a sheep
  - Gets teased (bullied) for having mixed parentage
  - "Doctors and donors and it's kind of personal so how about we don't talk about it?"
  - Except Mama Roo brings it up as gently as she can with Maddy, who really (really) doesn't want to talk about it
- Central and Shaper Blazes are mirror images of each other
  - both believe the ends justify the means
- the Prosecutors include a bot and a cyborg
  - not just about protecting people from bots
  - "There are plenty of bad breathers out there as well" says the bot (gets smacked for using the word)
- Shaper Blazes sneers that other tortoises have served as Prosecutors
  - turns out Shaper Leaf used to be a Prosecutor but left because he lost faith in what they were doing
- Shaper Leaf sacrifices himself in the end to destroy Central
  - tells Sindy it's good luck not bad: "always wanted... to be useful..."
- the Makers' enormous ship enters orbit at the end
- which is a signal for Lasercase to emerge from the Mire
  - it has become a vessel for the Gears, which turns out to be the real villain
- The Gears needs Sindy's luck shaping to defeat Central

Prince Thokmay and Sergeant Gyalpa stayed on horseback until they were over the
crest of the hill. When the sergeant finally reined in, the prince slid off the
horse's back and raised his battle mask.  To the south, the tornado was a dark
stain on the sky headed toward Apple Bridge.  Behind them, the land was still
once again, and eerily quiet.  There was no sign of the other soldiers, or of
the smugglers---for all that Thokmay could see, he and Sergeant Gyalpa were
alone in the world.

The sergeant fumbled with the strap on his battle mask for a moment and then
raised it as well.  His jaw was clenched, and his frown showed pain as much as
anger.  "How bad is it?"  Prince Thokmay asked, gesturing at the older man's
leg.

The sergeant shook his head. "It's all by right, Your Highness."  At the
prince's skeptical look, he reluctantly continued, "I don't think it's broken,
but the knee is along by bad shape. Put me up against that tree over there, and
go and get help. I'll be all right."

"I think I'd rather have some company," the prince replied lightly.  "Here, have
some of this." He handed the half-empty canteen hanging from the rear of the
saddle to the sergeant.  As the soldier drank, Thokmay looked around more
carefully.  There was no sign of the sun, he realized, but the land was still
somehow lit by a soft glow that came from nowhere and everywhere at once.  In
front of them, the hillside tumbled down to a narrow valley.  A few trees grew
near the small stream that ran along the its bottom.

"What do you think happened to the others?" he asked quietly.

Sergeant Gyalpa shook his head.  "I don't know, Your Highness.  But they've been
along by this before---some of them, anyway.  They'll all be right."  He patted
his horse's neck and lowered his battle mask once again. "I think I see a path
down there by that stream."

They picked their way down the rocky hillside. It was bigger than it had
seemed---it seemed that the further down they went, the further they had to
go. Prince Thokmay walked in front, while Sergeant Gyalpa rode behind him with
the reins in one hand and his sword laid across his lap.

Neither of them spoke until they reached the valley floor.  The path turned out
to be a narrow dirt road, and the stream wide enough to be called a river.

"It's further than I thought," the prince said, looking back the way they had
come.

"It's all like that around by here," Sergeant Gyalpa said gruffly. He gestured
with his sword toward a small clump of trees. "Twisted, like them. Something
that looks like it's along by a hundred yards away can take you all day to get
to.  Or it's so far on as you can barely see it, but you take ten steps and
there you are.  Ranneda says it's something to do by how the magic bends the
light."  He shook his head. "I don't pretend to have the understanding of it."

"Nor I." He paused. "I thought about becoming a magician once, you know," he
suddenly confessed. "After what happened in Stale. I thought that since I'd
already made one trade, I might as well make some more."

The sergeant grunted.  "What made you change your mind, if you don't mind me
asking?"

The prince shrugged. "When I asked Barramarrabee about it---that's my father's
chief magician---he asked me if I really wanted to spend my life giving up
things I cared about.  When he put it that way, I had to wonder. I asked him why
anyone would ever become a magician."

"And what did he say?"

The prince shook his head. "All he said was that some people don't get to make
as many choices as a prince." He shook out the canteen as he spoke, and bent
over the stream.

"Wait! What are you doing?" Sergeant Gyalpa asked sharply.

The prince glanced up. "Filling the canteen," he said. "We're out of water."

"Hold it by the strap," the sergeant ordered. "Don't put your hand in the
water. Just dip the canteen. Yes, like that."

The prince lowered the canteen into the stream. Fat bubbles escaped from the
mouth for a moment, and then the prince said, "What...?"  The bubbles were
trapped under the surface of the stream, as though there was a thin layer of ice
on top of the water.

He tried to lift the canteen from the water. It wouldn't budge. He lowered it
slightly---it went deeper without any resistance. When he tried to raise it
again, it simply wouldn't come up.

"What's going on?" he asked, suddenly almost afraid as he had been during the
battle.

The sergeant raised his battle mask and scowled at the stream as if it were a
new recruit who had just tripped over his own bootlaces. "I've seen this before,
Your Highness.  It comes along by patches here and there.  Sometimes the water
is just water, and sometimes..." He pointed at the canteen. "Sometimes it plays
games like that."

The prince swallowed. "I could have put my hand in there."

"Yes, Your Highness, You could have," the sergeant agreed. "But you wouldn't
ever have taken it out again 'til whatever it is let you. You'll probably want
to stay out from under those as well," he added, pointing at the trees up
ahead. "They might not be as smart as the ones close along by Fast Lake, but
they can be as mean as wolverines."

He winced suddenly as his horse shifted her weight. "Is there anything we can do
for your leg?" the prince asked.  "Manpa showed me how to make a splint."

The sergeant nodded.  "We can cut my tent poles in thirds," he said. "And then
we'll follow this stream. I think that way is east---the Trout's off there
somewhere. If we can make it along by that far, we can get a raft to take us
back up to Apple Bridge."

The prince noticed that the sergeant said "if", not "when", but didn't comment.
Instead, he slid the bamboo tent poles out of the canvas sleeve on the horse's
back and started cutting them to length with his sword.

That done, he helped Sergeant Gyalpa get down onto the ground. The sergeant had
to lie flat in the saddle, then swing his good leg over the horse's back and
slide down into Prince Thokmay's arms, trying as he did so to keep his good leg
underneath him.  The horse whinnied as the sergeant lowered himself to the
ground. "Just straighten it at the knee, Your Highness," the sergeant said
through gritted teeth. "Yes, like that. Good jo-aagh. No, no, it's all right,
it's all right. Try again. Use your weight. Urgh. Harder. No, go on, it's going
to hurt either way, you might as well---urrrggh."  Sergeant Gyalpa clenched his
fists so tightly that the prince heard one of the joints crack.

"Good enough. Put the poles down along beside it. You're going to have to get
the rope under it. Yes, like that. Now, easy, both hands, just lift---no, no,
both hands on my leg, just drop the rope underneath. Yes. And again. One
more. Uuhhh... All right, Your Highness, now tie it all up. No, tighter than
that. Don't worry about cutting off the blood. No, not like that. Where'd you
learn to tie knots?  Just cross it over and---here, let me."

Prince Thokmay sat back and watched while the sergeant untied and then re-tied
the knots in the rope that held the splint together.  The soldier's face was
knotted with pain, but his hands didn't hesitate.  When it was done, he nodded
at the prince. "Thank you, Your Highness.  You did all right for your first
time."

The prince nodded wearily. He wanted to lie down and sleep for a week, but
instead he stood up and brushed his hands on his jacket. "We should get going,"
he said, clasping the sergeant's hand and helping the older man get to his feet.

They set off along the narrow road, the prince walking, the sergeant riding.
Their conversation was sparse: "Watch out, that mud will be slippery," or "Put
those branches on behind me, we can use them for a fire tonight."

The prince guessed that they had covered four or five gallops in about two hours
when Sergeant Gyalpa finally said, "All right, we'll camp here for the night."
The little valley had widened and flattened, so that there was twenty strides or
so of level ground on either side of the road.  There was grass, too, and a few
blackberry bushes, and even a patch of reeds in the stream.

"Is it safe to let her graze?" the prince asked as the sergeant clambered down
from the saddle

Sergeant Gyalpa shook his head. "Not here, Your Highness. I have some oats along
in a bag somewhere---yes, good, give her that. Anything she eats from around
here will probably poison her, or turn her into a frog." He forced a smile. "Can
you see me riding on frogback?"

"I can see us both riding on one of Noxy's clouds," the prince said, trying to
smile back. "It'd be softer than that saddle, and we'd be so high up that all of
this would look like nothing more than a badly-drawn picture."

The sergeant snorted. "Thanks all the same, but I'll take my chances along down
here.  I know how to fall off a horse, but falling off one of those things..."
He shook his head.

The prince helped the sergeant onto the ground, then pointed at a clump of
blackberry bushes a few strides away. "There are some branches over there. If
you can stack the ones we have, I'll get some more. That ought to get us through
the night."

"Yes, Your Highness," the sergeant said.  He braced a branch against the stony
ground and leaned on it until it snapped, then set the two pieces on top of two
other, smaller pieces that he had already laid out.  With a pinch of fireseed
and a few quick twists of his flint, some tiny newborn flames began to crackle.

The sergeant sat back.  "Best get that wood quickkly, Your Highness. I can feel
the cold coming on."  Prince Thokmay nodded. He had felt the air growing cold as
well.

The blackberry bushes rustled slightly as the prince approached, even though
there was no wind.  "Easy, easy," he said softly. Somehow it didn't seem strange
in this place to be talking to a plant. "I'm not here for you. I just want those
old scraps of wood." He gave the bushes a wide berth, and started stacking the
dried-up old sticks in his arms.

He didn't notice the first flake of snow, or the second. It wasn't until one
landed on his cheek that he looked up and realized that the air was full of tiny
dancing white bits of fluff. "Seriously?" he muttered.  "It's the middle of
summer."  He picked up a few more pieces of wood and turned around.

The snow was falling faster now, so thickly that he could barely make out the
road. The flakes melted as soon as they touched the ground, but the air was
getting colder by the second. "Sergeant!" the prince shouted. "Sergeant, can you
hear me?"

"Yes, Your Highness," the sergeant called. He sounded puzzled. "What's the
problem?"

"I can barely see you," the prince said, his voice breaking. In fact, he
couldn't see the road at all.

"What's wrong, Your Highness? Are you all right?" Prince Thokmay heard the
sergeant grunt as he tried to get up.

"No, wait, stay where you are!" the prince called. He brushed a handful of snow
from his hair. "I just can't see through all this snow."

It wasn't until the sergeant said, "What snow, Your Highness?" that Prince
Thokmay felt afraid. He stumbled in the direction that he thought the sergeant's
voice had come from. The snow wasn't melting on the ground any longer.

"Sergeant!" he shouted. "Sergeant, have you got the fire going?"

"Yes, Your Highness! Can you see it?"

"No! Keep talking, I'll try to get to you!"

"But Your Highness, I can see you!" Prince Thokmay had to strain to hear the
sergeant's voice. The falling snow was muffling everything, and his fingers
were already going numb from the cold.

"Tell me which way to walk!" the prince shouted back desperately.  "Hurry!"

"Straight ahead, Your Highness! No, no, left! Left! That's right. That's right,
straight ahead! No, you're turning again!"

"I am not!" the prince shouted back in frustration. "I'm walking in a straight
line!"

"Stay where you are!" the sergeant shouted. "I'll come and get you!"

"No!" The prince paused for a moment. His teeth were chattering.  Suddenly he
had an idea. "Sergeant! Sergeant, can you hear me?"

"Yes, Your Highness!"

"Sergeant, I want you to put out the fire! Right now!" The prince dropped the
armload of wood he was somehow still carrying and took another few steps through
the knee-high snow. He couldn't feel his feet.

"But Your Highness---"

"Right now!" The prince almost screamed.

There was no sound for a moment, then the sergeant shouted, "It's out, Your
Highness. What now?"

"Just keep talking!" the prince shouted, hoping he had guessed right.  "Just...
k-k-keep... t-t-t-talking!"

The prince slogged forward another step, and another. Was the snow falling a
little less heavily? He tried not to think about it. He remembered his uncle's
stories about retreating through a blizzard from Ax Medicine during the Anuat
rebellion, then tried to push them out of his mind as well. Most of the soldiers
in his uncle's regiment had never seen Ruuda-in-Ruuda again.

But a few heartbeats later there was no doubt: the snow was easing off, and if
the air wasn't warming up, at least it wasn't getting colder. Prince Thokmay
shouted, "Sergeant? Am I headed the right way?"

"Yes, Your Highness. No, wait, turn right. Now go ahead. No, turn right again,
and---hold on, Your Highness, stay right where you are."  Something thumped to
the ground a few feet away from the prince a moment later.

"Can you see that?" the sergeant called. It was a saddle bag with one of the
tent's stay ropes tied to it. The prince stumbled forward and grabbed the
rope. Its other end was knotted to another stay rope that led off through the
snow.

"I've got it!" the prince shouted. He trudged through the snow, holding onto the
rope like a sailor holding a guide rope in a heavy storm.

One moment Prince Thokmay was calf-deep in snow. The next, he was standing on
the road with the rope in his hands. He blinked, then whirled around.  The
tied-together ropes stretched no more than ten strides to the saddle bag, which
sat dumbly on the dry, stony ground. The wood the prince had collected lay in a
tumble next to the bag.

"But I---it was s-s-snowing!" the prince chattered.

"I know, Your Highness," the sergeant said. "You're covered in it. And your
hands---you're freezing! I'll get the fire started again."

"No!" Thokmay clenched his teeth for a moment in a vain attempt to get them
under control. "Th-that's what st-st-started it, I think. The l-l-land was
ang-ang-angry about th-the f-fire."

"Well, it didn't do anything along by here, Your Highness," the sergeant said
firmly.  "And we have to get you warmed up."

It only took Sergeant Gyalpa a few heartbeats to coax a small spark to life in a
second pinch of fireseed, and another few moments to get it to catch on a small
branch. The prince wrapped his arms around his body as the fire took hold once
again. Feeling slowly returned to his fingers and toes, and what they mostly
felt was painful.

He sniffled and wiped his nose. "I couldn't see anything," he said. "I mean, out
there."

"I couldn't either, Your Highness" the sergeant said. "You were just stumbling
around, it looked like." He frowned. "Sergeant Ranneda told us once that there
are safe roads in the Blight. The Pilots built them so they could cart stuff in
along to Fast Lake. Maybe this was one of them."

"B-best we stay on it, then," the prince said, his voice cracking.

The sergeant nodded. "Best we do, Your Highness." He looked up at the dull gray
sky. "I just wonder what's going to be waiting for us when we get out."

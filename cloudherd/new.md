## Prolog

*Consider Cherne.  A diamond adrift in the heavens, it measures eight
thousand gallops from north to south and six thousand from east to
west.  Its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great
ocean, whose outer shore, the Worldrim, rises up to hold that sweet
speck of life as a child might cup a drop of water in her hand.*

*Cherne's history began with the Pilot Angels, and nearly ended with
them as well.  Powerful and inhuman, their reign ended in a long
Mutiny that scarred the moon, turned Lake Karaband into a sea of
glass, and littered the land with strange magic.  When it was over the
Pilot Angels were gone, leaving the world to carry on as best it
could.*

*Now look there, in the north, where the Brumoso Mountains rise above
the endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms and a girl is doing her
chores.  She is no longer a child but not yet an adult, and has no
idea that her world is about to change forever...*

## Chapter 1: Soldiers

Noxy was collecting spiderwebs when the soldiers came to Stale.
Winter had turned to spring, and the sun shone diamond-bright in a
clear blue sky, but stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the
shadows of the twisted mountain pines.

"Shoo."  She poked a fat brown squirrel spider with a stick.  It waved
its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a
new home.  Noxy cut its web's anchor threads with two practiced twists
of her knife and began winding it onto a stick.

"Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?" Sensy asked.

Noxy glanced at her.  "Why? Are those ones coming loose?"

"No." Sensy looked down at her soft brown goatskin coat critically.
"They're just kind of plain.  Granna Fee has some really nice red
ones.  She said she'd give them to me if I picked the stones out of
her pepper garden."

"Her whole garden? That would take forever." Noxy shook the dew off
the spider's web and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over
her shoulder.  "Why would you do all that work for buttons you don't
need?"

"Oh, you're no help," Sensy pouted.  She had spent the winter
embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket's cuffs and collar.
All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes, and her
hair, and the boys she and Noxy might meet that summer, who couldn't
possibly be as boring as the ones in Stale.  Especially
Rash---practically *anyone* would be more fun to be around than Rash.

"A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes," Granna Fee
had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger who
seemed to have taken her best friend's place.

"Not me!" Noxy had declared.

Her grandmother had laughed.  "No, daffodil, not you."

Noxy was reaching for another web when a high-pitched voice shouted,
"Soldiers! Soldiers!"

"Oh, wonderful," she sighed, rolling her eyes at Sensy.  The whole
point of going out to collect spider webs that morning had been to get
*away* from the younger children for a few hours.

Young Gas crashed through a bush and tripped over a root, then picked
himself up and ran over to the two girls.  "There's soldiers in the
village!" he said breathlessly, tugging at Noxy's sleeve.  "And
they've been fighting!  And there's a *tiger* with them!"

"Sure," Noxy said wearily, pulling her arm away.  "And there's a
dragon under your bed."  The mountains that lined the pass below Stale
were still covered in snow.  Avalanches happened almost every
day---someone would have to be foolish *and* desperate to be on the
road this early in the spring.

"But they're *real*!" Young Gas protested, hopping from one foot to
another.  "They've got swords, and some of them are bleeding!  And the
tiger can *talk*!"

Noxy opened her mouth to say, "Why don't you go jump in the fishpond?"
but a deep *boom boom* cut her off.  She and Sensy looked at each
other wide-eyed.  *Boom boom*, pause.  *Boom boom*, pause.  It was
Stale's home drum.  It meant a house was on fire, or a bear had
wandered into the village, or someone was lost in a storm and needed
help to find their way home.  It meant trouble.

Noxy hung her bag on a nearby branch.  "Come on!" she told Sensy.

"I told you!" Young Gas shouted behind them. "Hey, wait for me!"

The path was one of dozens that wound through the evergreen forest
that surrounded Stale.  Mud made it slippery where it wasn't slick
with ice, but Noxy didn't slow down until she reached the ridge above
the village.

She paused to catch her breath.  Below her lay the ancient walls of
the fortress of Stale.  Centuries of rain and snow had rounded the
edges off the Pilot Angels' stonework, making it look like a snow fort
that was just starting to melt, but it was still as solid as the
mountains themselves.  The village's two-story wooden houses sheltered
inside the walls like ducklings in a nest.  Thin licks of smoke rose
from their slate chimneys, while goat pens, vegetable plots, and racks
laden with drying spider webs filled the spaces between them.

To the west, the wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.  A
net woven from squirrel spider thread was stretched over its top, as
light as a dream but as strong as steel.  Another net hung down at the
gorge's mouth to make a gate.  Inside, just visible from the ridge,
two gray clouds floated half-asleep.

Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds,
riding them, and, most importantly, learning how to mind-talk to them.
Grownups said this pair were slow and lazy, but they were the most
exciting things in Noxy's world.  They, and the herd of half-wild
clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance, were the reason
Stale existed.

Noxy was about to set off again when Sensy grabbed her.  "Wait!" her
friend hissed, pointing into the trees.  For a moment all Noxy saw was
branches.  Then a pair of brown eyes blinked, and her mouth suddenly
went dry.

As she and Sensy started to back up, one slow step at a time, Little
Gas came pelting down the path behind them and ran straight into Noxy,
nearly knocking her off her feet.  "Whoa!" he exclaimed, "What's
happening?  Why did you---mmph!"

"Don't move!" Noxy whispered, her hand clamped over his mouth.
"Just... don't move."

Before Young Gas could protest, the hairy creature who had been
watching leaped for the nearest branch and swung himself up into the
tree.  He paused for a moment to study the trio again, then
disappeared into the greenery.

Sensy was the first to speak.  "Wh-what's a troll doing *here*?" she
asked shakily.

Noxy shook her head.  "Worry about that later.  Come on!"

The drum had stopped booming by the time the three children reached
the gap in the wall where an enormous counterbalanced stone door had
hung centuries ago.  The wooden replacement that Stale's current human
inhabitants had put up in its place was as solid as they could make
it, but still looked like a child's toy next to the Pilot Angels'
ancient work.

Inside, it seemed like the whole village was standing in the cobbled
square---or rather, the whole village minus most of the adults, who
had left a week ago for the snowfields to collect Stale's clouds from
their winter pasture.  Three hundred people, from babies in their
mothers' arms to Grappa Gas with his cane, stood in a half-circle on
one side of the square.  A dozen soldiers stood at attention in front
of them.  They wore steel helmets with yellow feathers on their
crests, and stiffened leather armor as thick as bootsoles that reached
from their shoulders to their waists.  Heavy wool kilts brushed
against the tops of their sturdy knee-high leather boots.  Each
soldier had a sword in a scabbard on his hip and a pack on his back.

And Young Gas had been right: they had been fighting.  One man's hand
was wrapped in a bloody bandage, while another's arm was in a sling.
None of them had washed or shaved in days, and from their haggard
faces, it didn't look like they had slept much either.

But Noxy didn't see any of that right away.  What she saw instead was
the tiger.  His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes, not
orange and black like the picture in the book that three generations
of village children had passed around.  A pair of golden earrings hung
from his left ear, and his tail twitched slightly, as if the assembled
villagers reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.

A boy stood beside him, armored like the soldiers and carrying a pack
as large as any of theirs.  When he turned his head, Noxy saw four
half-healed scars on his cheek, angry red against his near-black skin.
His back was straight, but he was trembling, though whether it was
because of the cold, weariness, fear, or all three, Noxy couldn't
tell.

Sensy tugged at Noxy's sleeve.  "Who *are* they?"

"Sh!" Noxy whispered back, not willing to admit that she didn't know.
"I'm trying to hear!"

Noxy's mother Indy nodded at the soldier she had been speaking to and
stepped up onto the speaker's stone that lay in the center of the
square.  "Friends," she said in a loud voice, patting the air with her
hands to quiet the villagers.  "Friends, please.  Thank you all for
coming.  I know it is early in the year for travellers, but please,
bid welcome to Sergeant Dorbu, of the Angry Canary troop."  The
soldier she had been speaking to bowed to the villagers.

"And to the Gifted Kulbinder, also of the Angry Canaries," Indy
continued, gesturing toward the tiger.  "They and their companions
will be our guests for the next little while."

"How long's a little while?" Aft asked loudly.  Noxy winced.  Aft had
stayed in the village instead of going to round up other adults
because his wife was expecting a baby.  He was the best cloudherd in
the village, at least in his own estimation, but had the manners of a
constipated goat.

"Until they are ready to travel again," Indy reassured him.  Her eyes
swept across the crowd.  "Their journey has been a hard one---they
hoped to get through to Chaghan, but the forest had other plans.
Sergeant?  Would you like to say a few words?"

The sergeant bowed again and stepped up onto the speaker's stone as
Indy stepped down.  Like the rest of the soldiers, his skin was black
compared to the villagers' dark brown, and his wiry hair was trimmed
to a thin fuzz.  Two yellow ribbons, exactly the same color as the
feathers in his helmet, ringed his left sleeve.

He smiled at the villagers and opened his mouth to speak, but Aft
spoke again before he could get a word out.  "You lot loyalists?"  the
cloudherd asked loudly.

"Give the man a chance to speak!" Grappa Gas said just as loudly,
rapping his cane against his wooden leg.  He and his son glared at
each other.

"You two behave," Granna Fee scolded them.  Noxy's grandmother was a
head shorter than either of the men, but the iron in her voice quieted
them both down.  She nodded at the sergeant.  "Go ahead, young man."

"Um, thank you, respected" the soldier said gratefully.  "And thank
you, people of Stale.  As your mayor said, my comrades and I were
trying to see if the pass to Chaghan was clear yet.  We---" He paused
for a moment before continuing.  "We were attacked three days ago and
driven off the road into the forest.  Everything seemed all right at
first, but then the forest must have spoken to the trolls and..."  He
shrugged.  "Well, you can probably guess what happened next."

Voices murmured.  The Herd of Trees covered the Brumoso Mountains from
wheat fields of Uws in the south to Garheim's frigid shores in the
north and the Ninety Kingdoms in the west.  It wasn't as cruel as the
Jungle of Thind, but it guarded its territoy and privileges as
jealously as a bear guarded her cubs.  Gifted creatures that wanted to
live in the forest had to do her bidding.  And humans were not welcome
inside its borders at all, not unless they stuck to the handful of
roads built long ago by the Pilot Angels.  Travellers who strayed were
rarely given warnings, and *never* given second chances.

A cold breeze whipped the sergeant's words across the square as he
continued.  "We finally made it back to the road, but the worst of our
hurt couldn't keep going, so we left them in camp with a few of the
able-bodied and came here looking for help.  They won't be able to
keep the trolls at bay for long."

Aft broke the silence that followed.  "So which side of the fight
*are* you on?" he asked, his voice still belligerent but three notches
less rude than it had been.

"I have the privilege of serving Her Highness, Princess Shudarga,"
Sergeant Dorbu said calmly.

"Rebels..." breathed a voice behind Noxy.  She and Sensy jumped and
spun around.  Rash had sidled up behind the two girls, but instead of
poking them in the ribs as he usually would, he had been listening to
the soldiers.

"Goat," Sensy muttered, punching his arm before turning her back on
him.  Rash grinned at Noxy, who scowled in return and pointedly turned
her back on him as well.

"Does that mean King Denpa's boys are going to come calling after
you?"  Grappa Gas demanded, waving down his son before Aft could speak
again.  As with everything else, they had chosen opposite sides when
Princess Shudarga raised her flag the previous summer.  "Because if
they do, these walls won't keep 'em out for long, and neither will
we."

The smile slipped from the sergeant's face.  Noxy suddenly saw how
weary he was.  "We didn't choose Stale for its walls, respected.  We
didn't choose it at all.  We just washed up here because we couldn't
go any further.  Our friends need help.  If you're afraid that'll
bring trouble, we'll understand if you send us on our way."

"Nobody is turning anyone away," Indy said firmly.  "We mountain folk
take pride in our hospitality.  We may not have much, but I'm sure we
can find some spare blankets to keep you warm and stretch our stores
enough to feed you for a few days."

"Thank you, respected," the sergeant said, bowing again.  "But what we
really want right now is a couple of clouds so we can go and rescue
our friends."

## Chapter 2: Not Quite What We Were Expecting

The next five minutes were chaos.  Out of the question, Grappa Gas
said, whacking his wooden leg with his cane to emphasize his points.
The law might forgive them giving shelter to a bunch of strays who
wandered in out of the cold, even if they were rebels, but flying off
to rescue their friends?  Why, when the laird came back---

---they'd show him the gate and send him on his way, Aft cut in, arms
crossed and brows knotted.  The lazy good-for-nothing had run for the
capital the day word of the rebellion had reached the mountains, and
hadn't been heard from since.  As far as Aft was concerned, he'd given
up any right to tell anyone what the law was.  And anyway, if they
were going to shelter rebels, what did it matter whether they'd come
to Stale or Stale had gone to them?  And anyway again, what would
other cloudherds say if they heard that Stalers had left men in the
forest to die?  Angels' names, what would the folk who'd gone up the
mountain to round up clouds say when they got back?

The argument swirled and churned across the cobblestones.  Little
whirlpools of disagreement came together, spun about, and flew apart
as people overheard neighbors they disagreed with, or turned around to
agree with something they had overheard and were sucked into yet
another "but what if?"

"This is going to go on forever," Noxy said sourly.  "They all know
they're going to do whatever my *amma* want to do in the end---why
don't they just get on with it?"  She, Sensy, and Rash had stayed
aloof on the sidelines, old enough that they hadn't grown bored and
run off with Young Gas and the other children, but young enough that
the whole thing seemed vaguely ridiculous.

Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a
mustache.  It had become a habit over the winter, one that Noxy had
told him countless times he ought to break before *someone* broke his
stupid finger.  "What I want to know is whether we're going to get to
go, or if we're going to be stuck here with the littles.  Again."

"Of course we'll get to go!" Noxy exclaimed.

"Are you sure?"  Rash raised an eyebrow, another annoying trick he had
developed while his broken leg had been healing through the winter.

Noxy puffed an annoyed breath, biting off her "of course I'm sure!"
when she caught Sensy's uncertain look.  "Wait here," she said with a
scowl.

She strode toward the center of the square, slowing as she neared the
speaker's stone.  Her mother was speaking intently with the sergeant.
The tiger sat impassively on his haunches next to them, his tail
twitching occasionally.  The boy with the scarred face still stood
beside him, his pack on the ground.  He looked like he was beyond
exhausted, but when his eyelids started to droop, the tiger growled
quietly and he snapped to attention again.

Noxy's mother caught sight of her.  "Oh, and this is my daughter,
Probably Noxious."

"Respected Noxious."  The sergeant bowed slightly.

Noxy hesitated, wondering if she was supposed to bow back, and was
immediately annoyed at herself.  Cloudherds didn't bow---that was a
silly lowlander custom.  "Just call me Noxy," she told him.  "*Amma*,
which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on?  We can go and start
getting them ready while everyone's still jawing."

Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well.  "Who said
anything about you three going?"

But Noxy knew her mother almost as well as her mother knew her, and
had assembled her arguments as she crossed the square.  They were
definitely old enough---why, they were all going to be riding *real*
clouds in a few weeks, not just tame old pair floating about in the
cloud pen.  And they wouldn't be going far, just a few gallops down
the pass, and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do
rescues, wasn't it?  And---

"Stop."  Her mother held up a hand, not noticing or just ignoring the
grin that had quirked the corner of Sergeant Dorbu's mouth.  "You can
go.  But!" she continued, "But you ride with Grappa Gas and Granna
Fee, and that's all you do---ride.  Understood?"

Noxy nodded obediently.  "Yes, *amma*."  She had learned the hard way
not to keep asking for a whole orange when she'd already talked her
mother into a half.

It only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed.
Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains, and more than
one tinker or trader had needed to be lifted out of a difficult spot
after running into a bear or being set upon by trolls.  Coils of hemp
rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the
cloud pen, and everyone kept an extra goatskin cap somewhere handy,
just in case.

"You look ridiculous," Sensy told Rash flatly as he came down the
wooden steps to the mounting platform.  He had been learning to
embroider during that winter's enforced idleness, and had stitched
what he claimed were eagle's wings onto the side flaps of his cap.

Rash looked her up and down.  "Really?  Because I think you look
amazing.  Excuse me."  He winked at Noxy and stepped around the
speechless 13-year-old to take his place on the platform.

"Ears all!" Aft called out, clapping his hands.  "You know how this is
done.  I'm fore on Big Blue, Gas and Fee will have Pillow for spotter.
We'll down, lift, and out, quick and simple, and get our new friends
back here for soup before you can sneeze.  No adventures, right?"  He
turned a steely glare toward Noxy, Sensy, and Rash, who nodded and
mumbled, "No adventures."

"Right!"  And without anything more than that he walked out to the end
of the board that stuck out three strides from the platform, looked
down to check that Big Blue was below him, and jumped.

Noxy leaned over the railing and held her breath.  One, two,
three... Big Blue dimpled under Aft's weight as the burly cloudherd
hit him dead center.  Gray waves rippled out across the cloud's back
as Aft rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly.
Noxy couldn't see his face, but she knew his eyes would be closed in
concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount, rousing it from its
winter half-sleep.

Something twinged in the back of her head.  She blinked, momentarily
disoriented.  "Did you say something?" she asked Sensy.

"What?"  She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.

"I said---never mind."  Noxy shook her head.  "Look, he's coming up."

Big Blue rose slowly toward the platform, bunching up into a firmer
mass as he came.  Aft had risen to one knee, but kept one hand on the
cloud's back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.  A
silver-tipped scaw shot out of its cliffside nest, cawing its
displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away.

Aft looked up and smiled the smile he only ever wore when he was on
cloudback or had his arm around his wife.  "You want me to get Pillow
for you?" he called up to his father.

"No need, I can---damn that boy!"  Grappa Gas harrumphed as Aft took
three long steps across Big Blue's back and launched himself into the
air again.

Rash whistled.  "Nice leap," he said appreciatively as Aft landed
right in the middle of Pillow.  "And blind, too."

"It's not such a trick," Noxy said dismissively, though she was
secretly impressed.  "He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she
was."

"Sure, but would you trust a cloud's directions that much?"  Rash
challenged her.  "Most of the time I can't make cheese or cherries out
of what they say."

Noxy shrugged.  She had realized early in their training that
mind-talking was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash,
or even for some of the olders who were already riding.  She had
stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing
off.  The only person she shared her progress with now was Granna Fee,
and even she didn't---

*Twinge.*  She winced and put her hand on the back of her head.  There
it was again, that feeling of, of---of something, but what?

This time Sensy noticed.  "Are you all right?"

"Sure," Noxy lied.  She wasn't going to do *anything* that might mean
being left behind.  "Come on, let's get going."

## Chapter 3: Arguments and Pursuit

Indy shook her head.  "It will have to wait, daffodil," she said as
her daughter opened her mouth to ask another question.  "Right now I
want you to go home and make some tea.  Use the big pot, and all the
honey we have left.  I have the feeling we're going to have lots of
visitors..."

The water hadn't even boiled before Grappa Gas showed up.  He rapped
on the door frame with his cane and entered without waiting for a
hello.  "Hey, daffodil.  Where's your mother?"

"She should be back in a little," Noxy said.  She added a handful of
tea leaves to the cinnamon bark and green cardamom pods already in the
pot.  It was an extravagance---the other pack traders who brought such
delicacies to the village wouldn't visit until the last of the snow
had melted, which was at least another month away---but Grappa Fee had
always said that a good cup of tea was worth a thousand words.

"Mind if I sit?" Grappa Gas settled himself on a stool that was at
least as old as he was and watched Noxy drizzle the last of the honey
into the pot.

"What did you find out?" Noxy asked after a moment.

The old man snorted.  "Just like your mother, aren't you? And your
granna, too.  Always thinking one step ahead of everyone else." He
smiled.  "You know, if your granna hadn't been so smart, I might've
wound up being your grappa.  I remember once when---"

"Grappa!" Noxy cut him off, exasperated and amused at the same time.
"Tell me what the soldiers said!"

"And how do you know they said anything?" Grappa Gas challenged her.

"Because they're a long way from home, and tired, and sore, and want
us all to like them," Indy answered, closing the front door behind
her.  "And because soldiers like to tell stories almost as much as you
do.  Now, what did you find out?" She kissed the old man on his
grizzled cheek and sat on the other stool.

For a moment all Grappa Gas could think of was how alike mother and
daughter were.  They didn't look alike---Noxy's hair was brown and
wavy instead of straight and black, and her face was square instead of
round---but they had the same quick minds.  He had predicted on Indy's
tenth birthday that she would be mayor before she was thirty.  *Better
start telling everyone that Noxy's going to take the job one day too,*
he thought.

"The king's men hit them while they were crossing the ford near Tastes
Like Duck Droppings," he told Indy.  "Just bad luck, but they were
caught on one side of the river when the rest of their army was on the
other."  His face darkened.  "Fellow I spoke to said the king's troops
must have had a magician with them, 'cos their tiger didn't catch wind
of 'em 'til it was too late.  He doesn't expect expect he'll see many
of his friends again."

Indy glanced at Noxy.  "This doesn't go out of this house," she
warned.  Noxy nodded, turning to the stove as the lid on the pot
started rattling.  She lifted the pot carefully with a forked stick to
pour the boiling water over the tea, then set the teapot on the table
to steep.

"Was there anything else?" Indy asked.

Grappa Gas frowned.  "They didn't say it, but King Denpa's winning.
And about time, too---he's got help now from half his neighbors, all
worried that Shudarga's craziness might be contagious.  If you ask
me---"

The front door banged open.  Aft strode in and glared at Indy.  "How
soon are they leaving?" he demanded.

"Well, good evening to you too," Grappa Gas muttered.

Aft ignored his father.  "How soon, Indy? You know you can't let them
stay."

Indy stood up slowly.  "Make yourself comfortable," she said,
gesturing at her stool.  "Noxy, go get the peeling stool from out
back.  Brush it off before you bring it in the house."

Aft glowered at Indy a moment longer, then sat down opposite his
father.  The short stool creaked in protest under his weight.  Despite
the cold, he was only wearing a sleeveless goatskin vest, knee-length
wool shorts, and a sturdy pair of boots.  His hair was pulled back in
a thick club braid, a blue ribbon from his wife's wedding collar woven
into it for luck.

Noxy set down the stool she had fetched for her mother, then began
pouring tea as inconspicuously as she could while Aft counted off the
reasons the rebels couldn't stay.  What if the king sent an army after
them? Wait, what did he mean "if", of course he would.  There were
only three hundred people in Stale, and only half a dozen of them had
ever held a sword.  Not that they *had* any swords.  And even if they
had---

FIXME: Indy interrupts

Noxy set a steaming mug of tea in front of him, and two more in front
of his father and Indy.  Indy stared into hers as if hoping the tiny
swirling leaves might spell out some answers.  "I know it's a big
thing," she said quietly.  "And I did think about turning them away,
but look at them.  They look like they've been through the Blight.  If
a storm caught them in the pass, they wouldn't even make it as far as
Makes Your Breath Smell.  How would that make us look?"

Aft scowled.  "What people think won't matter much if we've all had
our throats cut.  No, wait, hear me out."  He slurped his tea and set
the cup down with a clatter.  "This is a big decision for one person
to make.  Mayor or not, you could have asked people what they thought
before telling them they could stay.  Maybe someone else could have
thought of something."

"I did tell ask people," Indy said calmly.  "Your father, for one."

Aft glanced at Grappa Gas, who had a smug look on his face.  The
younger man colored slightly.  "I still don't think we should let them
stay more than a day or two," he grumbled.

"If you're going to *think*," his father snapped, "You could start by
thinking about what happens if we turn them away and the princess wins
this fight."

"If the princess wins? Hah!"  Aft slapped the table with his hand.
"Weren't you just saying the king's winning?"

Grappa Gas stood, his hands clenched into fists.  "Winning isn't won,
lad---and a fight's not over 'til it's over!"

"Stop it!" Indy said sharply.  "And sit down!  I will *not* have
you two getting into another punch-up in my kitchen!"

Grappa Gas made a noise in his throat but sat down.  Noxy let out the
breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding.  "The next few days are
going to be hard enough without you two arguing," her mother said in
her no-arguing-with-me voice.  "We didn't these men to fetch up on our
doorstep, but they did, and I'd hate to hear people say that Stale
ever turned away a traveller.  I admit, I'd be happier if it was just
the first bunch, but---"

"But what we've got instead is two dozen mouths to feed when we're
already down to dried apples and barley." Aft snorted.  "Never mind
the tiger.  What are we supposed to feed it? Or should I ask 'who'?"

"That's enough!" Indy snapped.  "Like them or not, there's no call for
that kind of talk."

"Hmph!" Aft snorted.  "All I can say is, let's hope there isn't a late
storm, because if there is, *I'm* going to be keeping *my* family
behind a good strong door." He swallowed the rest of his tea in one
gulp, stood, and nodded a curt goodbye to Noxy, and slammed the door
behind himself on the way out.

"Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if you were right!" Grappa Gas
called out.  "Maybe we'd have some peace and quiet around here if a
few of us *did* get eaten!"  He turned back to Indy.  "Don't worry
about his grumbling.  Or anyone else's, for that matter.  You're the
mayor until the village votes otherwise, and we'll all back you in
this."

"Thank you," Indy smiled.  "I appreciate it."

Grappa Gas smiled back, then drained the last of his tea.  "It's
good," he said to Noxy.  "Maybe wants more cinnamon next time,
though."

"I'll try to remember," Noxy promised.

Indy stood when Grappa Gas did.  "Will you stay for dinner?"

He shook his head and grinned.  "Thanks, girl, but I promised your
mother I'd help her, um, peel some potatoes."  He winked, ignoring
Noxy's little 'eww' of disgust.  Indy smiled and kissed him on the
cheek again.  He was humming as he left.

Noxy waited until her mother said down again before saying,
"*Amma*...?"

"Yes, daffodil?"

Noxy hesitated.  She didn't know where to start.  "Do you think the
king is going to come looking for them?"

Indy shook her head.  "I hope not.  They came through the forest, so
unless the army had a bird following them, or..."  She frowned.  "I
don't know, daffodil, I just don't know."

Noxy ran her finger around the bottom of her teacup to catch the last
of the honey.  "I thought we weren't going to take sides."

Her mother sighed.  "If we turn them away, we'd be taking the king's
side, wouldn't we?"  When the princess had marched on the capital the
previous summer, Aft had demanded that the cloudherds do their best to
drown her troops.  Grappa Gas had argued just as loudly that they
should support the rebellion.  After all, what had the king done for
them except take tax them and tell them they couldn't build a bigger
fishpond?  As the arguments grew more heated, Indy had put on her
collar, called everyone together, and laid down the law.  This was the
lowlanders' fight. The people of Stale Leftovers were *not* going to
take either side, not while she was mayor, and if anyone didn't like
it, she'd be more than happy to call an election.  Anyone?  No?  All
right, then, why didn't everyone get back to their chores, because
those spiderweb nets weren't going to mend themselves.

The two sat in silence for a moment.  Finally Indy stretched.  "So
tell me, did you collect some spider webs, or did you and Sensy spend
the whole day mooning after Rash?"

"*Amma*! And how can you think about spider webs on a day like this?
And anyway, Sensy's the one who's mooning after Rash and that stupid
moustache he's trying to grow.  *I* think it's dumb."

"Well, whoever's doing what, we need some fresh webs for ropes and
reins before the clouds come down."
